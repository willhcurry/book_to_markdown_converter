      "content": "A CAVIL ON CHRONOLOGY\nIt has been a while between books, I know. So a reminder may be in order.\nThe book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. The fourth volume was A Feast for Crows. However, this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense, so much as run in tandem with it.\nBoth Dance and Feast take up the story immediately after the events of the third volume in the series, A Storm of Swords. Whereas Feast focused on events in and around King\u2019s Landing, on the Iron Islands, and down in Dorne, Dance takes us north to Castle Black and the Wall (and beyond), and across the narrow sea to Pentos and Slaver\u2019s Bay, to pick up the tales of Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and all the other characters you did not see in the preceding volume. Rather than being sequential, the two books are parallel\u00a0\u2026\u00a0divided geographically, rather than chronologically.\nBut only up to a point.\nA Dance with Dragons is a longer book than A Feast for Crows, and covers a longer time period. In the latter half of this volume, you will notice certain of the viewpoint characters from A Feast for Crows popping up again. And that means just what you think it means: the narrative has moved past the time frame of Feast, and the two streams have once again rejoined each other.\nNext up, The Winds of Winter. Wherein, I hope, everybody will be shivering together once again.\u2026\n\u2014George R. R. Martin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n April 2011",

      "content": "PROLOGUE\nThe night was rank with the smell of man.\nThe warg stopped beneath a tree and sniffed, his grey-brown fur dappled by shadow. A sigh of piney wind brought the man-scent to him, over fainter smells that spoke of fox and hare, seal and stag, even wolf. Those were man-smells too, the warg knew; the stink of old skins, dead and sour, near drowned beneath the stronger scents of smoke and blood and rot. Only man stripped the skins from other beasts and wore their hides and hair.\nWargs have no fear of man, as wolves do. Hate and hunger coiled in his belly, and he gave a low growl, calling to his one-eyed brother, to his small sly sister. As he raced through the trees, his packmates followed hard on his heels. They had caught the scent as well. As he ran, he saw through their eyes too and glimpsed himself ahead. The breath of the pack puffed warm and white from long grey jaws. Ice had frozen between their paws, hard as stone, but the hunt was on now, the prey ahead. Flesh, the warg thought, meat.\nA man alone was a feeble thing. Big and strong, with good sharp eyes, but dull of ear and deaf to smells. Deer and elk and even hares were faster, bears and boars fiercer in a fight. But men in packs were dangerous. As the wolves closed on the prey, the warg heard the wailing of a pup, the crust of last night\u2019s snow breaking under clumsy man-paws, the rattle of hardskins and the long grey claws men carried.\nSwords, a voice inside him whispered, spears.\nThe trees had grown icy teeth, snarling down from the bare brown branches. One Eye ripped through the undergrowth, spraying snow. His packmates followed. Up a hill and down the slope beyond, until the wood opened before them and the men were there. One was female. The fur-wrapped bundle she clutched was her pup. Leave her for last, the voice whispered, the males are the danger. They were roaring at each other as men did, but the warg could smell their terror. One had a wooden tooth as tall as he was. He flung it, but his hand was shaking and the tooth sailed high.\nThen the pack was on them.\nHis one-eyed brother knocked the tooth-thrower back into a snowdrift and tore his throat out as he struggled. His sister slipped behind the other male and took him from the rear. That left the female and her pup for him.\nShe had a tooth too, a little one made of bone, but she dropped it when the warg\u2019s jaws closed around her leg. As she fell, she wrapped both arms around her noisy pup. Underneath her furs the female was just skin and bones, but her dugs were full of milk. The sweetest meat was on the pup. The wolf saved the choicest parts for his brother. All around the carcasses, the frozen snow turned pink and red as the pack filled its bellies.\nLeagues away, in a one-room hut of mud and straw with a thatched roof and a smoke hole and a floor of hard-packed earth, Varamyr shivered and coughed and licked his lips. His eyes were red, his lips cracked, his throat dry and parched, but the taste of blood and fat filled his mouth, even as his swollen belly cried for nourishment. A child\u2019s flesh, he thought, remembering Bump. Human meat. Had he sunk so low as to hunger after human meat? He could almost hear Haggon growling at him. \u201cMen may eat the flesh of beasts and beasts the flesh of men, but the man who eats the flesh of man is an abomination.\u201d\nAbomination. That had always been Haggon\u2019s favorite word. Abomination, abomination, abomination. To eat of human meat was abomination, to mate as wolf with wolf was abomination, and to seize the body of another man was the worst abomination of all. Haggon was weak, afraid of his own power. He died weeping and alone when I ripped his second life from him. Varamyr had devoured his heart himself. He taught me much and more, and the last thing I learned from him was the taste of human flesh.\nThat was as a wolf, though. He had never eaten the meat of men with human teeth. He would not grudge his pack their feast, however. The wolves were as famished as he was, gaunt and cold and hungry, and the prey\u00a0\u2026\u00a0two men and a woman, a babe in arms, fleeing from defeat to death. They would have perished soon in any case, from exposure or starvation. This way was better, quicker. A mercy.\n\u201cA mercy,\u201d he said aloud. His throat was raw, but it felt good to hear a human voice, even his own. The air smelled of mold and damp, the ground was cold and hard, and his fire was giving off more smoke than heat. He moved as close to the flames as he dared, coughing and shivering by turns, his side throbbing where his wound had opened. Blood had soaked his breeches to the knee and dried into a hard brown crust.\nThistle had warned him that might happen. \u201cI sewed it up the best I could,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cbut you need to rest and let it mend, or the flesh will tear open again.\u201d\nThistle had been the last of his companions, a spearwife tough as an old root, warty, windburnt, and wrinkled. The others had deserted them along the way. One by one they fell behind or forged ahead, making for their old villages, or the Milkwater, or Hardhome, or a lonely death in the woods. Varamyr did not know, and could not care. I should have taken one of them when I had the chance. One of the twins, or the big man with the scarred face, or the youth with the red hair. He had been afraid, though. One of the others might have realized what was happening. Then they would have turned on him and killed him. And Haggon\u2019s words had haunted him, and so the chance had passed.\nAfter the battle there had been thousands of them struggling through the forest, hungry, frightened, fleeing the carnage that had descended on them at the Wall. Some had talked of returning to the homes that they\u2019d abandoned, others of mounting a second assault upon the gate, but most were lost, with no notion of where to go or what to do. They had escaped the black-cloaked crows and the knights in their grey steel, but more relentless enemies stalked them now. Every day left more corpses by the trails. Some died of hunger, some of cold, some of sickness. Others were slain by those who had been their brothers-in-arms when they marched south with Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.\nMance is fallen, the survivors told each other in despairing voices, Mance is taken, Mance is dead. \u201cHarma\u2019s dead and Mance is captured, the rest run off and left us,\u201d Thistle had claimed, as she was sewing up his wound. \u201cTormund, the Weeper, Sixskins, all them brave raiders. Where are they now?\u201d\nShe does not know me, Varamyr realized then, and why should she? Without his beasts he did not look like a great man. I was Varamyr Sixskins, who broke bread with Mance Rayder. He had named himself Varamyr when he was ten. A name fit for a lord, a name for songs, a mighty name, and fearsome. Yet he had run from the crows like a frightened rabbit. The terrible Lord Varamyr had gone craven, but he could not bear that she should know that, so he told the spearwife that his name was Haggon. Afterward he wondered why that name had come to his lips, of all those he might have chosen. I ate his heart and drank his blood, and still he haunts me.\nOne day, as they fled, a rider came galloping through the woods on a gaunt white horse, shouting that they all should make for the Milkwater, that the Weeper was gathering warriors to cross the Bridge of Skulls and take the Shadow Tower. Many followed him; more did not. Later, a dour warrior in fur and amber went from cookfire to cookfire, urging all the survivors to head north and take refuge in the valley of the Thenns. Why he thought they would be safe there when the Thenns themselves had fled the place Varamyr never learned, but hundreds followed him. Hundreds more went off with the woods witch who\u2019d had a vision of a fleet of ships coming to carry the free folk south. \u201cWe must seek the sea,\u201d cried Mother Mole, and her followers turned east.\nVaramyr might have been amongst them if only he\u2019d been stronger. The sea was grey and cold and far away, though, and he knew that he would never live to see it. He was nine times dead and dying, and this would be his true death. A squirrel-skin cloak, he remembered, he knifed me for a squirrel-skin cloak.\nIts owner had been dead, the back of her head smashed into red pulp flecked with bits of bone, but her cloak looked warm and thick. It was snowing, and Varamyr had lost his own cloaks at the Wall. His sleeping pelts and woolen smallclothes, his sheepskin boots and fur-lined gloves, his store of mead and hoarded food, the hanks of hair he took from the women he bedded, even the golden arm rings Mance had given him, all lost and left behind. I burned and I died and then I ran, half-mad with pain and terror. The memory still shamed him, but he had not been alone. Others had run as well, hundreds of them, thousands. The battle was lost. The knights had come, invincible in their steel, killing everyone who stayed to fight. It was run or die.\nDeath was not so easily outrun, however. So when Varamyr came upon the dead woman in the wood, he knelt to strip the cloak from her, and never saw the boy until he burst from hiding to drive the long bone knife into his side and rip the cloak out of his clutching fingers. \u201cHis mother,\u201d Thistle told him later, after the boy had run off. \u201cIt were his mother\u2019s cloak, and when he saw you robbing her\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe was dead,\u201d Varamyr said, wincing as her bone needle pierced his flesh. \u201cSomeone smashed her head. Some crow.\u201d\n\u201cNo crow. Hornfoot men. I saw it.\u201d Her needle pulled the gash in his side closed. \u201cSavages, and who\u2019s left to tame them?\u201d No one. If Mance is dead, the free folk are doomed. The Thenns, giants, and the Hornfoot men, the cave-dwellers with their filed teeth, and the men of the western shore with their chariots of bone\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all of them were doomed as well. Even the crows. They might not know it yet, but those black-cloaked bastards would perish with the rest. The enemy was coming.\nHaggon\u2019s rough voice echoed in his head. \u201cYou will die a dozen deaths, boy, and every one will hurt\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but when your true death comes, you will live again. The second life is simpler and sweeter, they say.\u201d\nVaramyr Sixskins would know the truth of that soon enough. He could taste his true death in the smoke that hung acrid in the air, feel it in the heat beneath his fingers when he slipped a hand under his clothes to touch his wound. The chill was in him too, though, deep down in his bones. This time it would be cold that killed him.\nHis last death had been by fire. I burned. At first, in his confusion, he thought some archer on the Wall had pierced him with a flaming arrow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the fire had been inside him, consuming him. And the pain\u00a0\u2026\nVaramyr had died nine times before. He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bear\u2019s teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub. He died his first death when he was only six, as his father\u2019s axe crashed through his skull. Even that had not been so agonizing as the fire in his guts, crackling along his wings, devouring him. When he tried to fly from it, his terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter. One moment he had been soaring above the Wall, his eagle\u2019s eyes marking the movements of the men below. Then the flames had turned his heart into a blackened cinder and sent his spirit screaming back into his own skin, and for a little while he\u2019d gone mad. Even the memory was enough to make him shudder.\nThat was when he noticed that his fire had gone out.\nOnly a grey-and-black tangle of charred wood remained, with a few embers glowing in the ashes. There\u2019s still smoke, it just needs wood. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Varamyr crept to the pile of broken branches Thistle had gathered before she went off hunting, and tossed a few sticks onto the ashes. \u201cCatch,\u201d he croaked. \u201cBurn.\u201d He blew upon the embers and said a wordless prayer to the nameless gods of wood and hill and field.\nThe gods gave no answer. After a while, the smoke ceased to rise as well. Already the little hut was growing colder. Varamyr had no flint, no tinder, no dry kindling. He would never get the fire burning again, not by himself. \u201cThistle,\u201d he called out, his voice hoarse and edged with pain. \u201cThistle!\u201d\nHer chin was pointed and her nose flat, and she had a mole on one cheek with four dark hairs growing from it. An ugly face, and hard, yet he would have given much to glimpse it in the door of the hut. I should have taken her before she left. How long had she been gone? Two days? Three? Varamyr was uncertain. It was dark inside the hut, and he had been drifting in and out of sleep, never quite sure if it was day or night outside. \u201cWait,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cI will be back with food.\u201d So like a fool he\u2019d waited, dreaming of Haggon and Bump and all the wrongs he had done in his long life, but days and nights had passed and Thistle had not returned. She won\u2019t be coming back. Varamyr wondered if he had given himself away. Could she tell what he was thinking just from looking at him, or had he muttered in his fever dream?\nAbomination, he heard Haggon saying. It was almost as if he were here, in this very room. \u201cShe is just some ugly spearwife,\u201d Varamyr told him. \u201cI am a great man. I am Varamyr, the warg, the skinchanger, it is not right that she should live and I should die.\u201d No one answered. There was no one there. Thistle was gone. She had abandoned him, the same as all the rest.\nHis own mother had abandoned him as well. She cried for Bump, but she never cried for me. The morning his father pulled him out of bed to deliver him to Haggon, she would not even look at him. He had shrieked and kicked as he was dragged into the woods, until his father slapped him and told him to be quiet. \u201cYou belong with your own kind,\u201d was all he said when he flung him down at Haggon\u2019s feet.\nHe was not wrong, Varamyr thought, shivering. Haggon taught me much and more. He taught me how to hunt and fish, how to butcher a carcass and bone a fish, how to find my way through the woods. And he taught me the way of the warg and the secrets of the skinchanger, though my gift was stronger than his own.\nYears later he had tried to find his parents, to tell them that their Lump had become the great Varamyr Sixskins, but both of them were dead and burned. Gone into the trees and streams, gone into the rocks and earth. Gone to dirt and ashes. That was what the woods witch told his mother, the day Bump died. Lump did not want to be a clod of earth. The boy had dreamed of a day when bards would sing of his deeds and pretty girls would kiss him. When I am grown I will be the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Lump had promised himself. He never had, but he had come close. Varamyr Sixskins was a name men feared. He rode to battle on the back of a snow bear thirteen feet tall, kept three wolves and a shadowcat in thrall, and sat at the right hand of Mance Rayder. It was Mance who brought me to this place. I should not have listened. I should have slipped inside my bear and torn him to pieces.\nBefore Mance, Varamyr Sixskins had been a lord of sorts. He lived alone in a hall of moss and mud and hewn logs that had once been Haggon\u2019s, attended by his beasts. A dozen villages did him homage in bread and salt and cider, offering him fruit from their orchards and vegetables from their gardens. His meat he got himself. Whenever he desired a woman he sent his shadowcat to stalk her, and whatever girl he\u2019d cast his eye upon would follow meekly to his bed. Some came weeping, aye, but still they came. Varamyr gave them his seed, took a hank of their hair to remember them by, and sent them back. From time to time, some village hero would come with spear in hand to slay the beastling and save a sister or a lover or a daughter. Those he killed, but he never harmed the women. Some he even blessed with children. Runts. Small, puny things, like Lump, and not one with the gift.\nFear drove him to his feet, reeling. Holding his side to staunch the seep of blood from his wound, Varamyr lurched to the door and swept aside the ragged skin that covered it to face a wall of white. Snow. No wonder it had grown so dark and smoky inside. The falling snow had buried the hut.\nWhen Varamyr pushed at it, the snow crumbled and gave way, still soft and wet. Outside, the night was white as death; pale thin clouds danced attendance on a silver moon, while a thousand stars watched coldly. He could see the humped shapes of other huts buried beneath drifts of snow, and beyond them the pale shadow of a weirwood armored in ice. To the south and west the hills were a vast white wilderness where nothing moved except the blowing snow. \u201cThistle,\u201d Varamyr called feebly, wondering how far she could have gone. \u201cThistle. Woman. Where are you?\u201d\nFar away, a wolf gave howl.\nA shiver went through Varamyr. He knew that howl as well as Lump had once known his mother\u2019s voice. One Eye. He was the oldest of his three, the biggest, the fiercest. Stalker was leaner, quicker, younger, Sly more cunning, but both went in fear of One Eye. The old wolf was fearless, relentless, savage.\nVaramyr had lost control of his other beasts in the agony of the eagle\u2019s death. His shadowcat had raced into the woods, whilst his snow bear turned her claws on those around her, ripping apart four men before falling to a spear. She would have slain Varamyr had he come within her reach. The bear hated him, had raged each time he wore her skin or climbed upon her back.\nHis wolves, though\u00a0\u2026\nMy brothers. My pack. Many a cold night he had slept with his wolves, their shaggy bodies piled up around him to help keep him warm. When I die they will feast upon my flesh and leave only bones to greet the thaw come spring. The thought was queerly comforting. His wolves had often foraged for him as they roamed; it seemed only fitting that he should feed them in the end. He might well begin his second life tearing at the warm dead flesh of his own corpse.\nDogs were the easiest beasts to bond with; they lived so close to men that they were almost human. Slipping into a dog\u2019s skin was like putting on an old boot, its leather softened by wear. As a boot was shaped to accept a foot, a dog was shaped to accept a collar, even a collar no human eye could see. Wolves were harder. A man might befriend a wolf, even break a wolf, but no man could truly tame a wolf. \u201cWolves and women wed for life,\u201d Haggon often said. \u201cYou take one, that\u2019s a marriage. The wolf is part of you from that day on, and you\u2019re part of him. Both of you will change.\u201d\nOther beasts were best left alone, the hunter had declared. Cats were vain and cruel, always ready to turn on you. Elk and deer were prey; wear their skins too long, and even the bravest man became a coward. Bears, boars, badgers, weasels\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Haggon did not hold with such. \u201cSome skins you never want to wear, boy. You won\u2019t like what you\u2019d become.\u201d Birds were the worst, to hear him tell it. \u201cMen were not meant to leave the earth. Spend too much time in the clouds and you never want to come back down again. I know skinchangers who\u2019ve tried hawks, owls, ravens. Even in their own skins, they sit moony, staring up at the bloody blue.\u201d\nNot all skinchangers felt the same, however. Once, when Lump was ten, Haggon had taken him to a gathering of such. The wargs were the most numerous in that company, the wolf-brothers, but the boy had found the others stranger and more fascinating. Borroq looked so much like his boar that all he lacked was tusks, Orell had his eagle, Briar her shadowcat (the moment he saw them, Lump wanted a shadowcat of his own), the goat woman Grisella\u00a0\u2026\nNone of them had been as strong as Varamyr Sixskins, though, not even Haggon, tall and grim with his hands as hard as stone. The hunter died weeping after Varamyr took Greyskin from him, driving him out to claim the beast for his own. No second life for you, old man. Varamyr Threeskins, he\u2019d called himself back then. Greyskin made four, though the old wolf was frail and almost toothless and soon followed Haggon into death.\nVaramyr could take any beast he wanted, bend them to his will, make their flesh his own. Dog or wolf, bear or badger\u00a0\u2026\nThistle, he thought.\nHaggon would call it an abomination, the blackest sin of all, but Haggon was dead, devoured, and burned. Mance would have cursed him as well, but Mance was slain or captured. No one will ever know. I will be Thistle the spearwife, and Varamyr Sixskins will be dead. His gift would perish with his body, he expected. He would lose his wolves, and live out the rest of his days as some scrawny, warty woman\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he would live. If she comes back. If I am still strong enough to take her.\nA wave of dizziness washed over Varamyr. He found himself upon his knees, his hands buried in a snowdrift. He scooped up a fistful of snow and filled his mouth with it, rubbing it through his beard and against his cracked lips, sucking down the moisture. The water was so cold that he could barely bring himself to swallow, and he realized once again how hot he was.\nThe snowmelt only made him hungrier. It was food his belly craved, not water. The snow had stopped falling, but the wind was rising, filling the air with crystal, slashing at his face as he struggled through the drifts, the wound in his side opening and closing again. His breath made a ragged white cloud. When he reached the weirwood tree, he found a fallen branch just long enough to use as a crutch. Leaning heavily upon it, he staggered toward the nearest hut. Perhaps the villagers had forgotten something when they fled\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a sack of apples, some dried meat, anything to keep him alive until Thistle returned.\nHe was almost there when his crutch snapped beneath his weight, and his legs went out from under him.\nHow long he sprawled there with his blood reddening the snow Varamyr could not have said. The snow will bury me. It would be a peaceful death. They say you feel warm near the end, warm and sleepy. It would be good to feel warm again, though it made him sad to think that he would never see the green lands, the warm lands beyond the Wall that Mance used to sing about. \u201cThe world beyond the Wall is not for our kind,\u201d Haggon used to say. \u201cThe free folk fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well. South of the Wall, the kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.\u201d\nYou warned me, Varamyr thought, but it was you who showed me Eastwatch too. He could not have been more than ten. Haggon traded a dozen strings of amber and a sled piled high with pelts for six skins of wine, a block of salt, and a copper kettle. Eastwatch was a better place to trade than Castle Black; that was where the ships came, laden with goods from the fabled lands beyond the sea. The crows knew Haggon as a hunter and a friend to the Night\u2019s Watch, and welcomed the news he brought of life beyond their Wall. Some knew him for a skinchanger too, but no one spoke of that. It was there at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea that the boy he\u2019d been first began to dream of the warm south.\nVaramyr could feel the snowflakes melting on his brow. This is not so bad as burning. Let me sleep and never wake, let me begin my second life. His wolves were close now. He could feel them. He would leave this feeble flesh behind, become one with them, hunting the night and howling at the moon. The warg would become a true wolf. Which, though?\nNot Sly. Haggon would have called it abomination, but Varamyr had often slipped inside her skin as she was being mounted by One Eye. He did not want to spend his new life as a bitch, though, not unless he had no other choice. Stalker might suit him better, the younger male\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though One Eye was larger and fiercer, and it was One Eye who took Sly whenever she went into heat.\n\u201cThey say you forget,\u201d Haggon had told him, a few weeks before his own death. \u201cWhen the man\u2019s flesh dies, his spirit lives on inside the beast, but every day his memory fades, and the beast becomes a little less a warg, a little more a wolf, until nothing of the man is left and only the beast remains.\u201d\nVaramyr knew the truth of that. When he claimed the eagle that had been Orell\u2019s, he could feel the other skinchanger raging at his presence. Orell had been slain by the turncloak crow Jon Snow, and his hate for his killer had been so strong that Varamyr found himself hating the beastling boy as well. He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side. One skinchanger can always sense another. Mance should have let me take the direwolf. There would be a second life worthy of a king. He could have done it, he did not doubt. The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it.\nVaramyr could see the weirwood\u2019s red eyes staring down at him from the white trunk. The gods are weighing me. A shiver went through him. He had done bad things, terrible things. He had stolen, killed, raped. He had gorged on human flesh and lapped the blood of dying men as it gushed red and hot from their torn throats. He had stalked foes through the woods, fallen on them as they slept, clawed their entrails from their bellies and scattered them across the muddy earth. How sweet their meat had tasted. \u201cThat was the beast, not me,\u201d he said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cThat was the gift you gave me.\u201d\nThe gods made no reply. His breath hung pale and misty in the air. He could feel ice forming in his beard. Varamyr Sixskins closed his eyes.\nHe dreamt an old dream of a hovel by the sea, three dogs whimpering, a woman\u2019s tears.\nBump. She weeps for Bump, but she never wept for me.\nLump had been born a month before his proper time, and he was sick so often that no one expected him to live. His mother waited until he was almost four to give him a proper name, and by then it was too late. The whole village had taken to calling him Lump, the name his sister Meha had given him when he was still in their mother\u2019s belly. Meha had given Bump his name as well, but Lump\u2019s little brother had been born in his proper time, big and red and robust, sucking greedily at Mother\u2019s teats. She was going to name him after Father. Bump died, though. He died when he was two and I was six, three days before his nameday.\n\u201cYour little one is with the gods now,\u201d the woods witch told his mother, as she wept. \u201cHe\u2019ll never hurt again, never hunger, never cry. The gods have taken him down into the earth, into the trees. The gods are all around us, in the rocks and streams, in the birds and beasts. Your Bump has gone to join them. He\u2019ll be the world and all that\u2019s in it.\u201d\nThe old woman\u2019s words had gone through Lump like a knife. Bump sees. He is watching me. He knows. Lump could not hide from him, could not slip behind his mother\u2019s skirts or run off with the dogs to escape his father\u2019s fury. The dogs. Loptail, Sniff, the Growler. They were good dogs. They were my friends.\nWhen his father found the dogs sniffing round Bump\u2019s body, he had no way of knowing which had done it, so he took his axe to all three. His hands shook so badly that it took two blows to silence Sniff and four to put the Growler down. The smell of blood hung heavy in the air, and the sounds the dying dogs had made were terrible to hear, yet Loptail still came when father called him. He was the oldest dog, and his training overcame his terror. By the time Lump slipped inside his skin it was too late.\nNo, Father, please, he tried to say, but dogs cannot speak the tongues of men, so all that emerged was a piteous whine. The axe crashed into the middle of the old dog\u2019s skull, and inside the hovel the boy let out a scream. That was how they knew. Two days later, his father dragged him into the woods. He brought his axe, so Lump thought he meant to put him down the same way he had done the dogs. Instead he\u2019d given him to Haggon.\nVaramyr woke suddenly, violently, his whole body shaking. \u201cGet up,\u201d a voice was screaming, \u201cget up, we have to go. There are hundreds of them.\u201d The snow had covered him with a stiff white blanket. So cold. When he tried to move, he found that his hand was frozen to the ground. He left some skin behind when he tore it loose. \u201cGet up,\u201d she screamed again, \u201cthey\u2019re coming.\u201d\nThistle had returned to him. She had him by the shoulders and was shaking him, shouting in his face. Varamyr could smell her breath and feel the warmth of it upon cheeks gone numb with cold. Now, he thought, do it now, or die.\nHe summoned all the strength still in him, leapt out of his own skin, and forced himself inside her.\nThistle arched her back and screamed.\nAbomination. Was that her, or him, or Haggon? He never knew. His old flesh fell back into the snowdrift as her fingers loosened. The spearwife twisted violently, shrieking. His shadowcat used to fight him wildly, and the snow bear had gone half-mad for a time, snapping at trees and rocks and empty air, but this was worse. \u201cGet out, get out!\u201d he heard her own mouth shouting. Her body staggered, fell, and rose again, her hands flailed, her legs jerked this way and that in some grotesque dance as his spirit and her own fought for the flesh. She sucked down a mouthful of the frigid air, and Varamyr had half a heartbeat to glory in the taste of it and the strength of this young body before her teeth snapped together and filled his mouth with blood. She raised her hands to his face. He tried to push them down again, but the hands would not obey, and she was clawing at his eyes. Abomination, he remembered, drowning in blood and pain and madness. When he tried to scream, she spat their tongue out.\nThe white world turned and fell away. For a moment it was as if he were inside the weirwood, gazing out through carved red eyes as a dying man twitched feebly on the ground and a madwoman danced blind and bloody underneath the moon, weeping red tears and ripping at her clothes. Then both were gone and he was rising, melting, his spirit borne on some cold wind. He was in the snow and in the clouds, he was a sparrow, a squirrel, an oak. A horned owl flew silently between his trees, hunting a hare; Varamyr was inside the owl, inside the hare, inside the trees. Deep below the frozen ground, earthworms burrowed blindly in the dark, and he was them as well. I am the wood, and everything that\u2019s in it, he thought, exulting. A hundred ravens took to the air, cawing as they felt him pass. A great elk trumpeted, unsettling the children clinging to his back. A sleeping direwolf raised his head to snarl at empty air. Before their hearts could beat again he had passed on, searching for his own, for One Eye, Sly, and Stalker, for his pack. His wolves would save him, he told himself.\nThat was his last thought as a man.\nTrue death came suddenly; he felt a shock of cold, as if he had been plunged into the icy waters of a frozen lake. Then he found himself rushing over moonlit snows with his packmates close behind him. Half the world was dark. One Eye, he knew. He bayed, and Sly and Stalker gave echo.\nWhen they reached the crest the wolves paused. Thistle, he remembered, and a part of him grieved for what he had lost and another part for what he\u2019d done. Below, the world had turned to ice. Fingers of frost crept slowly up the weirwood, reaching out for each other. The empty village was no longer empty. Blue-eyed shadows walked amongst the mounds of snow. Some wore brown and some wore black and some were naked, their flesh gone white as snow. A wind was sighing through the hills, heavy with their scents: dead flesh, dry blood, skins that stank of mold and rot and urine. Sly gave a growl and bared her teeth, her ruff bristling. Not men. Not prey. Not these.\nThe things below moved, but did not live. One by one, they raised their heads toward the three wolves on the hill. The last to look was the thing that had been Thistle. She wore wool and fur and leather, and over that she wore a coat of hoarfrost that crackled when she moved and glistened in the moonlight. Pale pink icicles hung from her fingertips, ten long knives of frozen blood. And in the pits where her eyes had been, a pale blue light was flickering, lending her coarse features an eerie beauty they had never known in life.\nShe sees me.",

      "content": "TYRION\nHe drank his way across the narrow sea.\nThe ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more.\n\u201cThe world is full of wine,\u201d he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He\u2019d killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.\nBelowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. \u201cIs this Dornish wine?\u201d Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. \u201cIt reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.\u201d\nThe cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. \u201cHave I offended you?\u201d Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing. \u201cWere you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?\u201d That went unanswered too. \u201cWhere are we sailing? Tell me that.\u201d Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. \u201cIs it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?\u201d Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.\nOberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night\u2019s Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher\u2019s son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.\nThe cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. \u201cHave you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?\u201d the dwarf inquired. \u201cMight that be where whores go?\u201d Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.\nThe wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester\u2019s knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.\nSleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.\n\u201cWherever whores go,\u201d his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father\u2019s bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.\nVarys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose. That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, \u201cI\u2019ve killed my father,\u201d in the same tone a man might use to say, \u201cI\u2019ve stubbed my toe.\u201d\nThe master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. \u201cYou should not have climbed that ladder,\u201d he said reproachfully.\n\u201cWherever whores go.\u201d Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him.\n\u201cI killed Shae too,\u201d he confessed to Varys.\n\u201cYou knew what she was.\u201d\n\u201cI did. But I never knew what he was.\u201d\nVarys tittered. \u201cAnd now you do.\u201d\nI should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman\u2019s sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no, better not to think of Jaime.\nHe found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman\u2019s breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? \u201cSuch are the wages of the kinslayer,\u201d he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down.\nWhen he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they\u2019d come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.\nThat was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.\nIt ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.\nAbove him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.\nThe fat man looked down and smiled. \u201cA drunken dwarf,\u201d he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.\n\u201cA rotting sea cow.\u201d Tyrion\u2019s mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man\u2019s feet. They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.\n\u201cYou are insolent. I like that in a dwarf.\u201d When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. \u201cAre you hungry, my little friend? Weary?\u201d\n\u201cThirsty.\u201d Tyrion struggled to his knees. \u201cAnd filthy.\u201d\nThe fat man sniffed. \u201cA bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it.\u201d His host put the mallet and chisel aside. \u201cMy house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.\u201d\nAnd any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.\nThe fat man made good on the promised bath, though. No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep. He woke naked on a goose-down feather bed so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.\nThe room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.\nBeneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo\u2019s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.\nAcross the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea.\nHe wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh. Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.\nWhen he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. \u201cThis is Pentos, yes?\u201d\n\u201cJust so. Where else?\u201d\nPentos. Well, it was not King\u2019s Landing, that much could be said for it. \u201cWhere do whores go?\u201d he heard himself ask.\n\u201cWhores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from amongst my servingwomen. None will dare refuse you.\u201d\n\u201cSlaves?\u201d the dwarf asked pointedly.\nThe fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. \u201cSlavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.\u201d Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow. \u201cBut now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session.\u201d He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. \u201cExplore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here.\u201d\n\u201cWere? Have I gone somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cTime enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my fat friend,\u201d Tyrion replied. He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. \u201cSpice soldiers and cheese lords,\u201d his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I was gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father\u2019s belly.\nA light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father\u2019s guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts.\n\u201cWherever whores go,\u201d he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.\nThe magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey\u2019s had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. Moths had been at them too. At least they do not stink of vomit.\nTyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. \u201cGood morrow to you, fair ladies,\u201d he said with a bow. \u201cDo you know where whores go?\u201d When they did not respond, he repeated the question in High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore. The younger, fatter cook gave him a shrug that time.\nHe wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his bedchamber. None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant these two. The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother. Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open-handed when it came to coin. The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold.\nTyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he\u2019d seen.\nAs it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them. Tyrion pictured how his sister\u2019s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one must ever come between my brother and my sister.\nWith a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall. He had strong arms and he did not weigh much. He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike. I will search for a rope on the morrow, he resolved.\nHe saw three gates during his wanderings\u2014the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies\u2019 bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected. A pity I did not think of that before I became a beggar.\nHe walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well. She looked to be his own age, with dull red hair and a broad face dotted by freckles. \u201cWould you like some wine?\u201d he asked her. She looked at him uncertainly. \u201cI have no cup for you, we\u2019ll have to share.\u201d The washerwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. \u201cTell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?\u201d The name made her look up. \u201cThat far?\u201d Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink. \u201cI am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I\u2019d be so grateful; why, I\u2019ll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?\u201d He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. \u201cI have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn\u2019t that be droll?\u201d The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio\u2019s tunics, large enough to double as a sail. \u201cI should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you\u2019re quite right. Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night\u2019s Watch, they say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?\u201d He filled his cup again. \u201cWhat do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?\u201d\nThe washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away. I cannot seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected. Somehow his flagon had gone dry. Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep. \u201cWhere do whores go?\u201d he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you\u2019re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father. \u201cWherever whores go,\u201d Lord Tywin said. She loved me. She was a crofter\u2019s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me.\nThe empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard. Tyrion pushed himself off the bench and went to fetch it. As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving tile. Pale white they were, with speckles, and red-ribbed undersides dark as blood. The dwarf snapped one off and sniffed it. Delicious, he thought, and deadly.\nThere were seven of the mushrooms. Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something. He picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down his pocket. The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut his eyes.\nWhen he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose-down feather bed once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she said, \u201cyour bath awaits. Magister Illyrio expects you at table within the hour.\u201d\nTyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands. \u201cDo I dream, or do you speak the Common Tongue?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord. I was bought to please the king.\u201d She was blue-eyed and fair, young and willowy.\n\u201cI am sure you did. I need a cup of wine.\u201d\nShe poured for him. \u201cMagister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed. My name\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is of no interest to me. Do you know where whores go?\u201d\nShe flushed. \u201cWhores sell themselves for coin.\u201d\n\u201cOr jewels, or gowns, or castles. But where do they go?\u201d\nThe girl could not grasp the question. \u201cIs it a riddle, m\u2019lord? I\u2019m no good at riddles. Will you tell me the answer?\u201d\nNo, he thought. I despise riddles, myself. \u201cI will tell you nothing. Do me the same favor.\u201d The only part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said. The words were on his tongue, but somehow never passed his lips. She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool who thinks I play at riddles. If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much. I must be sick, or dead. \u201cYou mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.\u201d\nAs he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair. Afterward she rubbed sweet-smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy\u2019s clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth-of-gold. \u201cWill my lord want me after he has eaten?\u201d she asked as she was lacing up his boots.\n\u201cNo. I am done with women.\u201d Whores.\nThe girl took that disappointment too well for his liking. \u201cIf m\u2019lord would prefer a boy, I can have one waiting in his bed.\u201d\nM\u2019lord would prefer his wife. M\u2019lord would prefer a girl named Tysha. \u201cOnly if he knows where whores go.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s mouth tightened. She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself. That he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the others had at least the grace to feign affection. A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart wine after too much sweet.\n\u201cI believe I have changed my mind,\u201d he told her. \u201cWait for me abed. Naked, if you please, I\u2019ll be a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing. Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of us should get on splendidly.\u201d He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was revulsion. No one fears a dwarf. Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a crossbow in his hands. \u201cDo you moan when you are being fucked?\u201d he asked the bedwarmer.\n\u201cIf it please m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cIt might please m\u2019lord to strangle you. That\u2019s how I served my last whore. Do you think your master would object? Surely not. He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.\u201d This time, when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted.\nIllyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden bowl. His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig\u2019s eyes shining above his fat cheeks. Jewels danced when he moved his hands; onyx and opal, tiger\u2019s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl. I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion mused, though I\u2019d need a cleaver to claim them.\n\u201cCome sit, my little friend.\u201d Illyrio waved him closer.\nThe dwarf clambered up onto a chair. It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended to accommodate the magister\u2019s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight. Tyrion Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions. I am a mouse in a mammoth\u2019s lair, he mused, though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar. The thought made him thirsty. He called for wine.\n\u201cDid you enjoy the girl I sent you?\u201d Illyrio asked.\n\u201cIf I had wanted a girl I would have asked for one.\u201d\n\u201cIf she failed to please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe did all that was required of her.\u201d\n\u201cI would hope so. She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love. The king enjoyed her greatly.\u201d\n\u201cI kill kings, hadn\u2019t you heard?\u201d Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup. \u201cI want no royal leavings.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish. Let us eat.\u201d Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running.\nThey began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well. Then came quails in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig. The sight of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, and once he had tasted it he was lost. The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business. He had never eaten so well, even at court.\nAs he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning\u2019s summons. The fat man shrugged. \u201cThere are troubles in the east. Astapor has fallen, and Meereen. Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.\u201d The suckling pig was carved. Illyrio reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers.\n\u201cSlaver\u2019s Bay is a long way from Pentos.\u201d Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife. No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell.\n\u201cThis is so,\u201d Illyrio agreed, \u201cbut the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble. More wine?\u201d Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth. \u201cNo, something better.\u201d He clapped his hands together.\nAt the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish. He placed it in front of Tyrion, and Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid. \u201cMushrooms,\u201d the magister announced, as the smell wafted up. \u201cKissed with garlic and bathed in butter. I am told the taste is exquisite. Have one, my friend. Have two.\u201d\nTyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio\u2019s voice made him stop abruptly. \u201cAfter you, my lord.\u201d He pushed the dish toward his host.\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back. For a heartbeat it seemed as if a mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheesemonger\u2019s bloated flesh. \u201cAfter you. I insist. Cook made them specially for you.\u201d\n\u201cDid she indeed?\u201d He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through with dark blue veins. \u201cThat was kind of her, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no.\u201d Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of butter from which it had emerged.\n\u201cYou are too suspicious.\u201d Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard. Oiled every morning to make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected. \u201cAre you craven? I had not heard that of you.\u201d\n\u201cIn the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at supper.\u201d\n\u201cHere as well.\u201d Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup. \u201cYet when a guest plainly wishes to end his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?\u201d He took a gulp. \u201cMagister Ordello was poisoned by a mushroom not half a year ago. The pain is not so much, I am told. Some cramping in the gut, a sudden ache behind the eyes, and it is done. Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?\u201d\nThe dwarf studied the dish before him. The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering. Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were. He was not brave enough to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard. That frightened him more than he could say. \u201cYou mistake me,\u201d he heard himself say.\n\u201cIs it so? I wonder. If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and quickly. Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.\u201d\n\u201cYou mistake me,\u201d Tyrion said again, more loudly. The buttered mushrooms glistened in the lamplight, dark and inviting. \u201cI have no wish to die, I promise you. I have\u00a0\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off into uncertainty. What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love?\n\u201cYou have nothing,\u201d finished Magister Illyrio, \u201cbut we can change that.\u201d He plucked a mushroom from the butter, and chewed it lustily. \u201cDelicious.\u201d\n\u201cThe mushrooms are not poisoned.\u201d Tyrion was irritated.\n\u201cNo. Why should I wish you ill?\u201d Magister Illyrio ate another. \u201cWe must show a little trust, you and I. Come, eat.\u201d He clapped his hands again. \u201cWe have work to do. My little friend must keep his strength up.\u201d\nThe serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, creamed herring, candied onions, foul-smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black swan in her plumage. Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister. He helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions. And the serving men filled his wine cup anew each time he emptied it.\n\u201cYou drink a deal of wine for such a little man.\u201d\n\u201cKinslaying is dry work. It gives a man a thirst.\u201d\nThe fat man\u2019s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers. \u201cThere are those in Westeros who would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.\u201d\n\u201cThey had best not say it in my sister\u2019s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.\u201d The dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half. \u201cAnd you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister. Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.\u201d\nThat seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end. He slapped a meaty thigh and said, \u201cYou Westerosi are all the same. You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or dragons or eagles. I can take you to a real lion, my little friend. The prince keeps a pride in his menagerie. Would you like to share a cage with them?\u201d\nThe lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit. \u201cVery well,\u201d he conceded. \u201cA Lannister is not a lion. Yet I am still my father\u2019s son, and Jaime and Cersei are mine to kill.\u201d\n\u201cHow odd that you should mention your fair sister,\u201d said Illyrio, between snails. \u201cThe queen has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.\u201d\nIt was no more than Tyrion had expected. \u201cIf you mean to take her up on it, make her spread her legs for you as well. The best part of me for the best part of her, that\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d\n\u201cI would sooner have mine own weight in gold.\u201d The cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion feared he was about to rupture. \u201cAll the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?\u201d\n\u201cThe gold I grant you,\u201d the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of half-digested eels and sweetmeats, \u201cbut the Rock is mine.\u201d\n\u201cJust so.\u201d The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch. \u201cDo you think King Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law. Your brother wears the white cloak, so you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cStannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cbut for the small matter of regicide and kinslaying. For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand. But why would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cWhy else would you go the Wall?\u201d\n\u201cStannis is at the Wall?\u201d Tyrion rubbed at his nose. \u201cWhat in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing at the Wall?\u201d\n\u201cShivering, I would think. It is warmer down in Dorne. Perhaps he should have sailed that way.\u201d\nTyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the Common Speech than she pretended. \u201cMy niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens. And I have half a mind to make her a queen.\u201d\nIllyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them both. \u201cWhat has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?\u201d\n\u201cEven a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,\u201d said Tyrion, wounded. \u201cQueen her, I said. Not kill her.\u201d\nThe cheesemonger spooned up cherries. \u201cIn Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death\u2019s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough. If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.\u201d\nTyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill her. And I knew that. \u201cFutile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.\u201d\nMagister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand. \u201cThe road to Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend. Nor does it run beneath the Wall. Yet there is such a road, I tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.\u201d This talk of roads annoyed him. Does he think this is a game?\n\u201cWhat one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.\u201d Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table. \u201cYet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.\u201d\n\u201cRemind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.\u201d\n\u201cAre your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and soon enough, no food. When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.\u201d\n\u201cThey may look, but if all they find is Stannis\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot Stannis. Nor Myrcella.\u201d The yellow smile widened. \u201cAnother. Stronger than Tommen, gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella. A savior come from across the sea to bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cFine words.\u201d Tyrion was unimpressed. \u201cWords are wind. Who is this bloody savior?\u201d\n\u201cA dragon.\u201d The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed. \u201cA dragon with three heads.\u201d",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nShe could hear the dead man coming up the steps. The slow, measured sound of footsteps went before him, echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall. Daenerys Targaryen awaited him upon the ebon bench that she had made her throne. Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silver-gold hair all tousled.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Ser Barristan Selmy, the lord commander of her Queensguard, \u201cthere is no need for you to see this.\u201d\n\u201cHe died for me.\u201d Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest. Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic covered her to midthigh. She had been dreaming of a house with a red door when Missandei woke her. There had been no time to dress.\n\u201cKhaleesi,\u201d whispered Irri, \u201cyou must not touch the dead man. It is bad luck to touch the dead.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you killed them yourself.\u201d Jhiqui was bigger-boned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy breasts. \u201cThat is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d Irri agreed.\nDothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but could be utter fools about much else. They are only girls, besides. Her handmaids were of an age with her\u2014women grown to look at them, with their black hair, copper skin, and almond-shaped eyes, but girls all the same. They had been given to her when she wed Khal Drogo. It was Drogo who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide of a hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. It was too big for her and had a musty smell, but it made her feel as if her sun-and-stars was still near her.\nGrey Worm appeared atop the steps first, a torch in hand. His bronze cap was crested with three spikes. Behind him followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on their shoulders. Their caps had only one spike each, and their faces showed so little they might have been cast of bronze as well. They laid the corpse down at her feet. Ser Barristan pulled back the bloodstained shroud. Grey Worm lowered the torch, so she might see.\nThe dead man\u2019s face was smooth and hairless, though his cheeks had been slashed open ear to ear. He had been a tall man, blue-eyed and fair of face. Some child of Lys or Old Volantis, snatched off a ship by corsairs and sold into bondage in red Astapor. Though his eyes were open, it was his wounds that wept. There were more wounds than she could count.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Ser Barristan said, \u201cthere was a harpy drawn on the bricks in the alley where he was found\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0drawn in blood.\u201d Daenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by night, and over each kill they left their mark. \u201cGrey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?\u201d By her command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they always walked in pairs.\n\u201cMy queen,\u201d replied the captain, \u201cyour servant Stalwart Shield had no duty last night. He had gone to a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a certain place\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to drink, and have companionship.\u201d\n\u201cA certain place? What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cA house of pleasure, Your Grace.\u201d\nA brothel. Half of her freedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training bedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. Brothels had sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen. It is all they know. They need to survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew cheaper. In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen\u2019s slaver nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic taste, she knew. Even so\u00a0\u2026 \u201cWhat could a eunuch hope to find in a brothel?\u201d\n\u201cEven those who lack a man\u2019s parts may still have a man\u2019s heart, Your Grace,\u201d said Grey Worm. \u201cThis one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the women of the brothels to lie with him and hold him.\u201d\nThe blood of the dragon does not weep. \u201cStalwart Shield,\u201d she said, dry-eyed. \u201cThat was his name?\u201d\n\u201cIf it please Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a fine name.\u201d The Good Masters of Astapor had not allowed their slave soldiers even names. Some of her Unsullied reclaimed their birth names after she had freed them; others chose new names for themselves. \u201cIs it known how many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?\u201d\n\u201cThis one does not know. Many.\u201d\n\u201cSix or more,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cFrom the look of his wounds, they swarmed him from all sides. He was found with an empty scabbard. It may be that he wounded some of his attackers.\u201d\nDany said a silent prayer that somewhere one of the Harpy\u2019s Sons was dying even now, clutching at his belly and writhing in pain. \u201cWhy did they cut open his cheeks like that?\u201d\n\u201cGracious queen,\u201d said Grey Worm, \u201chis killers had forced the genitals of a goat down the throat of your servant Stalwart Shield. This one removed them before bringing him here.\u201d\nThey could not feed him his own genitals. The Astapori left him neither root nor stem. \u201cThe Sons grow bolder,\u201d Dany observed. Until now, they had limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen, cutting them down in the streets or breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to murder them in their beds. \u201cThis is the first of my soldiers they have slain.\u201d\n\u201cThe first,\u201d Ser Barristan warned, \u201cbut not the last.\u201d\nI am still at war, Dany realized, only now I am fighting shadows. She had hoped for a respite from the killing, for some time to build and heal.\nShrugging off the lion pelt, she knelt beside the corpse and closed the dead man\u2019s eyes, ignoring Jhiqui\u2019s gasp. \u201cStalwart Shield shall not be forgotten. Have him washed and dressed for battle and bury him with cap and shield and spears.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall be as Your Grace commands,\u201d said Grey Worm.\n\u201cSend men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any man has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we will pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the butchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.\u201d Perhaps some goatherd would confess. \u201cHenceforth, no man of mine walks alone after dark.\u201d\n\u201cThese ones shall obey.\u201d\nDaenerys pushed her hair back. \u201cFind these cowards for me. Find them, so that I might teach the Harpy\u2019s Sons what it means to wake the dragon.\u201d\nGrey Worm saluted her. His Unsullied closed the shroud once more, lifted the dead man onto their shoulders, and bore him from the hall. Ser Barristan Selmy remained behind. His hair was white, and there were crow\u2019s-feet at the corners of his pale blue eyes. Yet his back was still unbent, and the years had not yet robbed him of his skill at arms. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cI fear your eunuchs are ill suited for the tasks you set them.\u201d\nDany settled on her bench and wrapped her pelt about her shoulders once again. \u201cThe Unsullied are my finest warriors.\u201d\n\u201cSoldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace. They were made for the battlefield, to stand shoulder to shoulder behind their shields with their spears thrust out before them. Their training teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly, without thought or hesitation\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not to unravel secrets or ask questions.\u201d\n\u201cWould knights serve me any better?\u201d Selmy was training knights for her, teaching the sons of slaves to fight with lance and longsword in the Westerosi fashion\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but what good would lances do against cowards who killed from the shadows?\n\u201cNot in this,\u201d the old man admitted. \u201cAnd Your Grace has no knights, save me. It will be years before the boys are ready.\u201d\n\u201cThen who, if not Unsullied? Dothraki would be even worse.\u201d Dothraki fought from horseback. Mounted men were of more use in open fields and hills than in the narrow streets and alleys of the city. Beyond Meereen\u2019s walls of many-colored brick, Dany\u2019s rule was tenuous at best. Thousands of slaves still toiled on vast estates in the hills, growing wheat and olives, herding sheep and goats, and mining salt and copper. Meereen\u2019s storehouses held ample supplies of grain, oil, olives, dried fruit, and salted meat, but the stores were dwindling. So Dany had dispatched her tiny khalasar to subdue the hinterlands, under the command of her three bloodriders, whilst Brown Ben Plumm took his Second Sons south to guard against Yunkish incursions.\nThe most crucial task of all she had entrusted to Daario Naharis, glib-tongued Daario with his gold tooth and trident beard, smiling his wicked smile through purple whiskers. Beyond the eastern hills was a range of rounded sandstone mountains, the Khyzai Pass, and Lhazar. If Daario could convince the Lhazarene to reopen the overland trade routes, grains could be brought down the river or over the hills at need\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the Lamb Men had no reason to love Meereen. \u201cWhen the Stormcrows return from Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets,\u201d she told Ser Barristan, \u201cbut until then I have only the Unsullied.\u201d Dany rose. \u201cYou must excuse me, ser. The petitioners will soon be at my gates. I must don my floppy ears and become their queen again. Summon Reznak and the Shavepate, I\u2019ll see them when I\u2019m dressed.\u201d\n\u201cAs Your Grace commands.\u201d Selmy bowed.\nThe Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers, surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. As a cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace. To the west sunlight blazed off the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids of the mighty. In some of those pyramids, the Sons of the Harpy are plotting new murders even now, and I am powerless to stop them.\nViserion sensed her disquiet. The white dragon lay coiled around a pear tree, his head resting on his tail. When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold. His horns were gold as well, and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail. \u201cYou\u2019re lazy,\u201d she told him, scratching under his jaw. His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun. Dragons are fire made flesh. She had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift. \u201cYou should be hunting with your brothers. Have you and Drogon been fighting again?\u201d Her dragons were growing wild of late. Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak\u2019s tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had called. I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them?\nViserion\u2019s tail lashed sideways, thumping the trunk of the tree so hard that a pear came tumbling down to land at Dany\u2019s feet. His wings unfolded, and he half flew, half hopped onto the parapet. He grows, she thought as he launched himself into the sky. They are all three growing. Soon they will be large enough to bear my weight. Then she would fly as Aegon the Conqueror had flown, up and up, until Meereen was so small that she could blot it out with her thumb.\nShe watched Viserion climb in widening circles until he was lost to sight beyond the muddy waters of the Skahazadhan. Only then did Dany go back inside the pyramid, where Irri and Jhiqui were waiting to brush the tangles from her hair and garb her as befit the Queen of Meereen, in a Ghiscari tokar.\nThe garment was a clumsy thing, a long loose shapeless sheet that had to be wound around her hips and under an arm and over a shoulder, its dangling fringes carefully layered and displayed. Wound too loose, it was like to fall off; wound too tight, it would tangle, trip, and bind. Even wound properly, the tokar required its wearer to hold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a tokar demanded small, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy trailing fringes. It was not a garment meant for any man who had to work. The tokar was a master\u2019s garment, a sign of wealth and power.\nDany had wanted to ban the tokar when she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. \u201cThe Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever hated,\u201d warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. \u201cIn the wools of Westeros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a stranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen\u2019s queen must be a lady of Old Ghis.\u201d Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the Second Sons, had put it more succinctly. \u201cMan wants to be the king o\u2019 the rabbits, he best wear a pair o\u2019 floppy ears.\u201d\nThe floppy ears she chose today were made of sheer white linen, with a fringe of golden tassels. With Jhiqui\u2019s help, she wound the tokar about herself correctly on her third attempt. Irri fetched her crown, wrought in the shape of the three-headed dragon of her House. Its coils were gold, its wings silver, its three heads ivory, onyx, and jade. Dany\u2019s neck and shoulders would be stiff and sore from the weight of it before the day was done. A crown should not sit easy on the head. One of her royal forebears had said that, once. Some Aegon, but which one? Five Aegons had ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. There would have been a sixth, but the Usurper\u2019s dogs had murdered her brother\u2019s son when he was still a babe at the breast. If he had lived, I might have married him. Aegon would have been closer to my age than Viserys. Dany had only been conceived when Aegon and his sister were murdered. Their father, her brother Rhaegar, perished even earlier, slain by the Usurper on the Trident. Her brother Viserys had died screaming in Vaes Dothrak with a crown of molten gold upon his head. They will kill me too if I allow it. The knives that slew my Stalwart Shield were meant for me.\nShe had not forgotten the slave children the Great Masters had nailed up along the road from Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every mile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After Meereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number of Great Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and the stench had lingered long in the plaza. Yet some days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a sly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their slaves, yes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most could scarce afford to eat. Those too old or young to be of use had been cast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still the Great Masters gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain of how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed beggars, thieves, and whores.\nTo rule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them. \u201cI am ready,\u201d she told Irri.\nReznak and Skahaz waited atop the marble steps. \u201cGreat queen,\u201d declared Reznak mo Reznak, \u201cyou are so radiant today I fear to look on you.\u201d The seneschal wore a tokar of maroon silk with a golden fringe. A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume and spoke a bastard form of High Valyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.\n\u201cYou are kind to say so,\u201d Dany answered, in the same tongue.\n\u201cMy queen,\u201d growled Skahaz mo Kandaq, of the shaven head. Ghiscari hair was dense and wiry; it had long been the fashion for the men of the Slaver Cities to tease it into horns and spikes and wings. By shaving, Skahaz had put old Meereen behind him to accept the new, and his kin had done the same after his example. Others followed, though whether from fear, fashion, or ambition, Dany could not say; shavepates, they were called. Skahaz was the Shavepate\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the vilest of traitors to the Sons of the Harpy and their ilk. \u201cWe were told about the eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cHis name was Stalwart Shield.\u201d\n\u201cMore will die unless the murderers are punished.\u201d Even with his shaven scalp, Skahaz had an odious face\u2014a beetled brow, small eyes with heavy bags beneath them, a big nose dark with blackheads, oily skin that looked more yellow than the usual amber of Ghiscari. It was a blunt, brutal, angry face. She could only pray it was an honest one as well.\n\u201cHow can I punish them when I do not know who they are?\u201d Dany demanded of him. \u201cTell me that, bold Skahaz.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no lack of enemies, Your Grace. You can see their pyramids from your terrace. Zhak, Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families. Pahl. Pahl, most of all. A house of women now. Bitter old women with a taste for blood. Women do not forget. Women do not forgive.\u201d\nNo, Dany thought, and the Usurper\u2019s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros. It was true that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl. Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong Belwas in single combat. His father, commander of Meereen\u2019s city watch, had died defending the gates when Joso\u2019s Cock smashed them into splinters. Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty-three on the plaza. \u201cHow much gold have we offered for information concerning the Sons of the Harpy?\u201d Dany asked.\n\u201cOne hundred honors, if it please Your Radiance.\u201d\n\u201cOne thousand honors would please us more. Make it so.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace has not asked for my counsel,\u201d said Skahaz Shavepate, \u201cbut I say that blood must pay for blood. Take one man from each of the families I have named and kill him. The next time one of yours is slain, take two from each great House and kill them both. There will not be a third murder.\u201d\nReznak squealed in distress. \u201cNoooo\u00a0\u2026\u00a0gentle queen, such savagery would bring down the ire of the gods. We will find the murderers, I promise you, and when we do they will prove to be baseborn filth, you shall see.\u201d\nThe seneschal was as bald as Skahaz, though in his case the gods were responsible. \u201cShould any hair be so insolent as to appear, my barber stands with razor ready,\u201d he had assured her when she raised him up. There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for Reznak\u2019s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. The Undying of Qarth had told her she would be thrice betrayed. Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei?\n\u201cSkahaz,\u201d she told the Shavepate, \u201cI thank you for your counsel. Reznak, see what one thousand honors may accomplish.\u201d Clutching her tokar, Daenerys swept past them down the broad marble stair. She took one step at a time, lest she trip over her fringe and go tumbling headfirst into court.\nMissandei announced her. The little scribe had a sweet, strong voice. \u201cAll kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons.\u201d\nThe hall had filled. Unsullied stood with their backs to the pillars, holding shields and spears, the spikes on their caps jutting upward like a row of knives. The Meereenese had gathered beneath the eastern windows. Her freedmen stood well apart from their former masters. Until they stand together, Meereen will know no peace. \u201cArise.\u201d Dany settled onto her bench. The hall rose. That at least they do as one.\nReznak mo Reznak had a list. Custom demanded that the queen begin with the Astapori envoy, a former slave who called himself Lord Ghael, though no one seemed to know what he was lord of.\nLord Ghael had a mouth of brown and rotten teeth and the pointed yellow face of a weasel. He also had a gift. \u201cCleon the Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons.\u201d\nIrri slid the slippers onto Dany\u2019s feet. They were gilded leather, decorated with green freshwater pearls. Does the butcher king believe a pair of pretty slippers will win my hand? \u201cKing Cleon is most generous. You may thank him for his lovely gift.\u201d Lovely, but made for a child. Dany had small feet, yet the pointed slippers mashed her toes together.\n\u201cGreat Cleon will be pleased to know they pleased you,\u201d said Lord Ghael. \u201cHis Magnificence bids me say that he stands ready to defend the Mother of Dragons from all her foes.\u201d\nIf he proposes again that I wed King Cleon, I\u2019ll throw a slipper at his head, Dany thought, but for once the Astapori envoy made no mention of a royal marriage. Instead he said, \u201cThe time has come for Astapor and Meereen to end the savage reign of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, who are sworn foes to all those who live in freedom. Great Cleon bids me tell you that he and his new Unsullied will soon march.\u201d\nHis new Unsullied are an obscene jape. \u201cKing Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let the Yunkai\u2019i tend theirs.\u201d It was not that Dany harbored any love for Yunkai. She was coming to regret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field. The Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy raising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.\nCleon the self-styled Great was no better, however. The Butcher King had restored slavery to Astapor, the only change being that the former slaves were now the masters and the former masters were now the slaves.\n\u201cI am only a young girl and know little of the ways of war,\u201d she told Lord Ghael, \u201cbut we have heard that Astapor is starving. Let King Cleon feed his people before he leads them out to battle.\u201d She made a gesture of dismissal. Ghael withdrew.\n\u201cMagnificence,\u201d prompted Reznak mo Reznak, \u201cwill you hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?\u201d\nAgain? Dany nodded, and Hizdahr strode forth; a tall man, very slender, with flawless amber skin. He bowed on the same spot where Stalwart Shield had lain in death not long before. I need this man, Dany reminded herself. Hizdahr was a wealthy merchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas. He had visited Volantis, Lys, and Qarth, had kin in Tolos and Elyria, and was even said to wield some influence in New Ghis, where the Yunkai\u2019i were trying to stir up enmity against Dany and her rule.\nAnd he was rich. Famously and fabulously rich\u00a0\u2026\nAnd like to grow richer, if I grant his petition. When Dany had closed the city\u2019s fighting pits, the value of pit shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them up with both hands, and now owned most of the fighting pits in Meereen.\nThe nobleman had wings of wiry red-black hair sprouting from his temples. They made him look as if his head were about to take flight. His long face was made even longer by a beard bound with rings of gold. His purple tokar was fringed with amethysts and pearls. \u201cYour Radiance will know the reason I am here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, it must be because you have no other purpose but to plague me. How many times have I refused you?\u201d\n\u201cFive times, Your Magnificence.\u201d\n\u201cSix now. I will not have the fighting pits reopened.\u201d\n\u201cIf Your Majesty will hear my arguments\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI have. Five times. Have you brought new arguments?\u201d\n\u201cOld arguments,\u201d Hizdahr admitted, \u201cnew words. Lovely words, and courteous, more apt to move a queen.\u201d\n\u201cIt is your cause I find wanting, not your courtesies. I have heard your arguments so often I could plead your case myself. Shall I?\u201d Dany leaned forward. \u201cThe fighting pits have been a part of Meereen since the city was founded. The combats are profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to the gods of Ghis. The mortal art of Ghis is not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength most pleasing to your gods. Victorious fighters are pampered and acclaimed, and the slain are honored and remembered. By reopening the pits I would show the people of Meereen that I respect their ways and customs. The pits are far-famed across the world. They draw trade to Meereen, and fill the city\u2019s coffers with coin from the ends of the earth. All men share a taste for blood, a taste the pits help slake. In that way they make Meereen more tranquil. For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits represent a judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence.\u201d She leaned back again, with a toss of her head. \u201cThere. How have I done?\u201d\n\u201cYour Radiance has stated the case much better than I could have hoped to do myself. I see that you are eloquent as well as beautiful. I am quite persuaded.\u201d\nShe had to laugh. \u201cAh, but I am not.\u201d\n\u201cYour Magnificence,\u201d whispered Reznak mo Reznak in her ear, \u201cit is customary for the city to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after expenses, as a tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.\u201d\n\u201cIt might\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though if we were to reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young girl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long enough to learn that much. Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies as you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but my answer is still no. For the sixth time.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen has spoken.\u201d He bowed again, as deeply as before. His pearls and amethysts clattered softly against the marble floor. A very limber man was Hizdahr zo Loraq.\nHe might be handsome, but for that silly hair. Reznak and the Green Grace had been urging Dany to take a Meereenese noble for her husband, to reconcile the city to her rule. Hizdahr zo Loraq might be worth a careful look. Sooner him than Skahaz. The Shavepate had offered to set aside his wife for her, but the notion made her shudder. Hizdahr at least knew how to smile.\n\u201cMagnificence,\u201d said Reznak, consulting his list, \u201cthe noble Grazdan zo Galare would address you. Will you hear him?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d said Dany, admiring the glimmer of the gold and the sheen of the green pearls on Cleon\u2019s slippers while doing her best to ignore the pinching in her toes. Grazdan, she had been forewarned, was a cousin of the Green Grace, whose support she had found invaluable. The priestess was a voice for peace, acceptance, and obedience to lawful authority. I can give her cousin a respectful hearing, whatever he desires.\nWhat he desired turned out to be gold. Dany had refused to compensate any of the Great Masters for the value of their slaves, but the Meereenese kept devising other ways to squeeze coin from her. The noble Grazdan had once owned a slave woman who was a very fine weaver, it seemed; the fruits of her loom were greatly valued, not only in Meereen, but in New Ghis and Astapor and Qarth. When this woman had grown old, Grazdan had purchased half a dozen young girls and commanded the crone to instruct them in the secrets of her craft. The old woman was dead now. The young ones, freed, had opened a shop by the harbor wall to sell their weavings. Grazdan zo Galare asked that he be granted a portion of their earnings. \u201cThey owe their skill to me,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI plucked them from the auction bloc and gave them to the loom.\u201d\nDany listened quietly, her face still. When he was done, she said, \u201cWhat was the name of the old weaver?\u201d\n\u201cThe slave?\u201d Grazdan shifted his weight, frowning. \u201cShe was\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Elza, it might have been. Or Ella. It was six years ago she died. I have owned so many slaves, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cLet us say Elza. Here is our ruling. From the girls, you shall have nothing. It was Elza who taught them weaving, not you. From you, the girls shall have a new loom, the finest coin can buy. That is for forgetting the name of the old woman.\u201d\nReznak would have summoned another tokar next, but Dany insisted that he call upon a freedman. Thereafter she alternated between the former masters and the former slaves. Many and more of the matters brought before her involved redress. Meereen had been sacked savagely after its fall. The stepped pyramids of the mighty had been spared the worst of the ravages, but the humbler parts of the city had been given over to an orgy of looting and killing as the city\u2019s slaves rose up and the starving hordes who had followed her from Yunkai and Astapor poured through the broken gates. Her Unsullied had finally restored order, but the sack left a plague of problems in its wake. And so they came to see the queen.\nA rich woman came, whose husband and sons had died defending the city walls. During the sack she had fled to her brother in fear. When she returned, she found her house had been turned into a brothel. The whores had bedecked themselves in her jewels and clothes. She wanted her house back, and her jewels. \u201cThey can keep the clothes,\u201d she allowed. Dany granted her the jewels but ruled the house was lost when she abandoned it.\nA former slave came, to accuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a freedwoman who had been the noble\u2019s bedwarmer before the city fell. The noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with child. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he wanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble\u2019s bastard as his own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. \u201cWhen he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as he would. By law, there was no rape.\u201d Her decision did not please him, she could see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would soon rule a city of eunuchs.\nA boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed up in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told of how two of his father\u2019s household slaves had risen up the night the gate broke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped his mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than the scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his father\u2019s house, and the other had joined the queen\u2019s soldiers as one of the Mother\u2019s Men. He wanted them both hanged.\nI am queen over a city built on dust and death. Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor would she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.\nWhen she told him, the boy rushed at her, but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went sprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The huge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat. \u201cEnough, Belwas,\u201d Dany called. \u201cRelease him.\u201d To the boy she said, \u201cTreasure that tokar, for it saved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You should do the same.\u201d But as he left the boy looked back over his shoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son.\nBy midday Daenerys was feeling the weight of the crown upon her head, and the hardness of the bench beneath her. With so many still waiting on her pleasure, she did not stop to eat. Instead she dispatched Jhiqui to the kitchens for a platter of flatbread, olives, figs, and cheese. She nibbled whilst she listened, and sipped from a cup of watered wine. The figs were fine, the olives even finer, but the wine left a tart metallic aftertaste in her mouth. The small pale yellow grapes native to these regions produced a notably inferior vintage. We shall have no trade in wine. Besides, the Great Masters had burned the best arbors along with the olive trees.\nIn the afternoon a sculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the Plaza of Purification with one cast in Dany\u2019s image. She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster. A pike of unprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished to give it to the queen. She admired the fish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the pike to her kitchens. A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished rings to wear to war. She accepted it with fulsome thanks; it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished copper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she would sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways of war knew that.\nThe slippers the Butcher King had sent her had grown too uncomfortable. Dany kicked them off and sat with one foot tucked beneath her and the other swinging back and forth. It was not a very regal pose, but she was tired of being regal. The crown had given her a headache, and her buttocks had gone to sleep. \u201cSer Barristan,\u201d she called, \u201cI know what quality a king needs most.\u201d\n\u201cCourage, Your Grace?\u201d\n\u201cCheeks like iron,\u201d she teased. \u201cAll I do is sit.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace takes too much on herself. You should allow your councillors to shoulder more of your burdens.\u201d\n\u201cI have too many councillors and too few cushions.\u201d Dany turned to Reznak. \u201cHow many more?\u201d\n\u201cThree-and-twenty, if it please Your Magnificence. With as many claims.\u201d The seneschal consulted some papers. \u201cOne calf and three goats. The rest will be sheep or lambs, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cThree-and-twenty.\u201d Dany sighed. \u201cMy dragons have developed a prodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their kills. Have these claims been proven?\u201d\n\u201cSome men have brought burnt bones.\u201d\n\u201cMen make fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing. Brown Ben says there are red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jackals and wild dogs. Must we pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the Skahazadhan?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Magnificence.\u201d Reznak bowed. \u201cShall I send these rascals away, or will you want them scourged?\u201d\nDaenerys shifted on the bench. \u201cNo man should ever fear to come to me.\u201d Some claims were false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine. Her dragons had grown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat, the larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they grow, the more they\u2019ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could easily devour a sheep a day. \u201cPay them for the value of their animals,\u201d she told Reznak, \u201cbut henceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall be done.\u201d Reznak turned to the petitioners. \u201cHer Magnificence the Queen has consented to compensate each of you for the animals you have lost,\u201d he told them in the Ghiscari tongue. \u201cPresent yourselves to my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid in coin or kind, as you prefer.\u201d\nThe pronouncement was received in sullen silence. You would think they might be happier, Dany thought. They have what they came for. Is there no way to please these people?\nOne man lingered behind as the rest were filing out\u2014a squat man with a windburnt face, shabbily dressed. His hair was a cap of coarse red-black wire cropped about his ears, and in one hand he held a sad cloth sack. He stood with his head down, gazing at the marble floor as if he had quite forgotten where he was. And what does this one want? Dany wondered.\n\u201cAll kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons,\u201d cried Missandei in her high, sweet voice.\nAs Dany stood, her tokar began to slip. She caught it and tugged it back in place. \u201cYou with the sack,\u201d she called, \u201cdid you wish to speak with us? You may approach.\u201d\nWhen he raised his head, his eyes were red and raw as open sores. Dany glimpsed Ser Barristan sliding closer, a white shadow at her side. The man approached in a stumbling shuffle, one step and then another, clutching his sack. Is he drunk, or ill? she wondered. There was dirt beneath his cracked yellow fingernails.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dany asked. \u201cDo you have some grievance to lay before us, some petition? What would you have of us?\u201d\nHis tongue flicked nervously over chapped, cracked lips. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I brought\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBones?\u201d she said, impatiently. \u201cBurnt bones?\u201d\nHe lifted the sack, and spilled its contents on the marble.\nBones they were, broken bones and blackened. The longer ones had been cracked open for their marrow.\n\u201cIt were the black one,\u201d the man said, in a Ghiscari growl, \u201cthe winged shadow. He come down from the sky and\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nNo. Dany shivered. No, no, oh no.\n\u201cAre you deaf, fool?\u201d Reznak mo Reznak demanded of the man. \u201cDid you not hear my pronouncement? See my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid for your sheep.\u201d\n\u201cReznak,\u201d Ser Barristan said quietly, \u201chold your tongue and open your eyes. Those are no sheep bones.\u201d\nNo, Dany thought, those are the bones of a child.",

      "content": "JON\nThe white wolf raced through a black wood, beneath a pale cliff as tall as the sky. The moon ran with him, slipping through a tangle of bare branches overhead, across the starry sky.\n\u201cSnow,\u201d the moon murmured. The wolf made no answer. Snow crunched beneath his paws. The wind sighed through the trees.\nFar off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like. They were hunting too. A wild rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood from his side where the goat\u2019s long horn had raked him. In another place, his little sister lifted her head to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her. The hills were warmer where they were, and full of food. Many a night his sister\u2019s pack gorged on the flesh of sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself.\n\u201cSnow,\u201d the moon called down again, cackling. The white wolf padded along the man trail beneath the icy cliff. The taste of blood was on his tongue, and his ears rang to the song of the hundred cousins. Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. Four remained\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and one the white wolf could no longer sense.\n\u201cSnow,\u201d the moon insisted.\nThe white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath frosting in the air. On starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream. The wolf\u2019s pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out. On the other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed. That was where his brother was, the grey brother who smelled of summer.\n\u201cSnow.\u201d An icicle tumbled from a branch. The white wolf turned and bared his teeth. \u201cSnow!\u201d His fur rose bristling, as the woods dissolved around him. \u201cSnow, snow, snow!\u201d He heard the beat of wings. Through the gloom a raven flew.\nIt landed on Jon Snow\u2019s chest with a thump and a scrabbling of claws. \u201cSNOW!\u201d it screamed into his face.\n\u201cI hear you.\u201d The room was dim, his pallet hard. Grey light leaked through the shutters, promising another bleak cold day. \u201cIs this how you woke Mormont? Get your feathers out of my face.\u201d Jon wriggled an arm out from under his blankets to shoo the raven off. It was a big bird, old and bold and scruffy, utterly without fear. \u201cSnow,\u201d it cried, flapping to his bedpost. \u201cSnow, snow.\u201d Jon filled his fist with a pillow and let fly, but the bird took to the air. The pillow struck the wall and burst, scattering stuffing everywhere just as Dolorous Edd Tollett poked his head through the door. \u201cBeg pardon,\u201d he said, ignoring the flurry of feathers, \u201cshall I fetch m\u2019lord some breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cCorn,\u201d cried the raven. \u201cCorn, corn.\u201d\n\u201cRoast raven,\u201d Jon suggested. \u201cAnd half a pint of ale.\u201d Having a steward fetch and serve for him still felt strange; not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for Lord Commander Mormont.\n\u201cThree corns and one roast raven,\u201d said Dolorous Edd. \u201cVery good, m\u2019lord, only Hobb\u2019s made boiled eggs, black sausage, and apples stewed with prunes. The apples stewed with prunes are excellent, except for the prunes. I won\u2019t eat prunes myself. Well, there was one time when Hobb chopped them up with chestnuts and carrots and hid them in a hen. Never trust a cook, my lord. They\u2019ll prune you when you least expect it.\u201d\n\u201cLater.\u201d Breakfast could wait; Stannis could not. \u201cAny trouble from the stockades last night?\u201d\n\u201cNot since you put guards on the guards, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d A thousand wildlings had been penned up beyond the Wall, the captives Stannis Baratheon had taken when his knights had smashed Mance Rayder\u2019s patchwork host. Many of the prisoners were women, and some of the guards had been sneaking them out to warm their beds. King\u2019s men, queen\u2019s men, it did not seem to matter; a few black brothers had tried the same thing. Men were men, and these were the only women for a thousand leagues.\n\u201cTwo more wildlings turned up to surrender,\u201d Edd went on. \u201cA mother with a girl clinging to her skirts. She had a boy babe too, all swaddled up in fur, but he was dead.\u201d\n\u201cDead,\u201d said the raven. It was one of the bird\u2019s favorite words. \u201cDead, dead, dead.\u201d\nThey had free folk drifting in most every night, starved half-frozen creatures who had run from the battle beneath the Wall only to crawl back when they realized there was no safe place to run to. \u201cWas the mother questioned?\u201d Jon asked. Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance Rayder\u2019s host and made the King-Beyond-the-Wall his captive\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more.\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord,\u201d said Edd, \u201cbut all she knows is that she ran off during the battle and hid in the woods after. We filled her full of porridge, sent her to the pens, and burned the babe.\u201d\nBurning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. Two kings to wake the dragon. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen\u2019s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. \u201cThere is power in a king\u2019s blood,\u201d the old maester had warned, \u201cand better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.\u201d The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye, but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.\nJon pissed in darkness, filling his chamber pot as the Old Bear\u2019s raven muttered complaints. The wolf dreams had been growing stronger, and he found himself remembering them even when awake. Ghost knows that Grey Wind is dead. Robb had died at the Twins, betrayed by men he\u2019d believed his friends, and his wolf had perished with him. Bran and Rickon had been murdered too, beheaded at the behest of Theon Greyjoy, who had once been their lord father\u2019s ward\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if dreams did not lie, their direwolves had escaped. At Queenscrown, one had come out of the darkness to save Jon\u2019s life. Summer, it had to be. His fur was grey, and Shaggydog is black. He wondered if some part of his dead brothers lived on inside their wolves.\nHe filled his basin from the flagon of water beside his bed, washed his face and hands, donned a clean set of black woolens, laced up a black leather jerkin, and pulled on a pair of well-worn boots. Mormont\u2019s raven watched with shrewd black eyes, then fluttered to the window. \u201cDo you take me for your thrall?\u201d When Jon folded back the window with its thick diamond-shaped panes of yellow glass, the chill of the morning hit him in the face. He took a breath to clear away the cobwebs of the night as the raven flapped away. That bird is too clever by half. It had been the Old Bear\u2019s companion for long years, but that had not stopped it from eating Mormont\u2019s face once he died.\nOutside his bedchamber a flight of steps descended to a larger room furnished with a scarred pinewood table and a dozen oak-and-leather chairs. With Stannis in the King\u2019s Tower and the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower burned to a shell, Jon had established himself in Donal Noye\u2019s modest rooms behind the armory. In time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would serve whilst he accustomed himself to command.\nThe grant that the king had presented him for signature was on the table beneath a silver drinking cup that had once been Donal Noye\u2019s. The one-armed smith had left few personal effects: the cup, six pennies and a copper star, a niello brooch with a broken clasp, a musty brocade doublet that bore the stag of Storm\u2019s End. His treasures were his tools, and the swords and knives he made. His life was at the forge. Jon moved the cup aside and read the parchment once again. If I put my seal to this, I will forever be remembered as the lord commander who gave away the Wall, he thought, but if I should refuse\u00a0\u2026\nStannis Baratheon was proving to be a prickly guest, and a restless one. He had ridden down the kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowled through the empty hovels of Mole\u2019s Town, inspected the ruined forts at Queensgate and Oakenshield. Each night he walked atop the Wall with Lady Melisandre, and during the days he visited the stockades, picking captives out for the red woman to question. He does not like to be balked. This would not be a pleasant morning, Jon feared.\nFrom the armory came a clatter of shields and swords, as the latest lot of boys and raw recruits armed themselves. He could hear the voice of Iron Emmett telling them to be quick about it. Cotter Pyke had not been pleased to lose him, but the young ranger had a gift for training men. He loves to fight, and he\u2019ll teach his boys to love it too. Or so he hoped.\nJon\u2019s cloak hung on a peg by the door, his sword belt on another. He donned them both and made his way to the armory. The rug where Ghost slept was empty, he saw. Two guardsmen stood inside the doors, clad in black cloaks and iron halfhelms, spears in their hands. \u201cWill m\u2019lord be wanting a tail?\u201d asked Garse.\n\u201cI think I can find the King\u2019s Tower by myself.\u201d Jon hated having guards trailing after him everywhere he went. It made him feel like a mother duck leading a procession of ducklings.\nIron Emmett\u2019s lads were well at it in the yard, blunted swords slamming into shields and ringing against one another. Jon stopped to watch a moment as Horse pressed Hop-Robin back toward the well. Horse had the makings of a good fighter, he decided. He was strong and getting stronger, and his instincts were sound. Hop-Robin was another tale. His clubfoot was bad enough, but he was afraid of getting hit as well. Perhaps we can make a steward of him. The fight ended abruptly, with Hop-Robin on the ground.\n\u201cWell fought,\u201d Jon said to Horse, \u201cbut you drop your shield too low when pressing an attack. You will want to correct that, or it is like to get you killed.\u201d\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord. I\u2019ll keep it higher next time.\u201d Horse pulled Hop-Robin to his feet, and the smaller boy made a clumsy bow.\nA few of Stannis\u2019s knights were sparring on the far side of the yard. King\u2019s men in one corner and queen\u2019s men in another, Jon did not fail to note, but only a few. It\u2019s too cold for most of them. As he strode past them, a booming voice called after him. \u201cBOY! YOU THERE! BOY!\u201d\nBoy was not the worst of the things that Jon Snow had been called since being chosen lord commander. He ignored it.\n\u201cSnow,\u201d the voice insisted, \u201cLord Commander.\u201d\nThis time he stopped. \u201cSer?\u201d\nThe knight overtopped him by six inches. \u201cA man who bears Valyrian steel should use it for more than scratching his arse.\u201d\nJon had seen this one about the castle\u2014a knight of great renown, to hear him tell it. During the battle beneath the Wall, Ser Godry Farring had slain a fleeing giant, pounding after him on horseback and driving a lance through his back, then dismounting to hack off the creature\u2019s pitiful small head. The queen\u2019s men had taken to calling him Godry the Giantslayer.\nJon remembered Ygritte, crying. I am the last of the giants. \u201cI use Longclaw when I must, ser.\u201d\n\u201cHow well, though?\u201d Ser Godry drew his own blade. \u201cShow us. I promise not to hurt you, lad.\u201d\nHow kind of you. \u201cSome other time, ser. I fear that I have other duties just now.\u201d\n\u201cYou fear. I see that.\u201d Ser Godry grinned at his friends. \u201cHe fears,\u201d he repeated, for the slow ones.\n\u201cYou will excuse me.\u201d Jon showed them his back.\nCastle Black seemed a bleak and forlorn place in the pale dawn light. My command, Jon Snow reflected ruefully, as much a ruin as it is a stronghold. The Lord Commander\u2019s Tower was a shell, the Common Hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin\u2019s Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though it had looked that way for years. Behind them rose the Wall: immense, forbidding, frigid, acrawl with builders pushing up a new switchback stair to join the remnants of the old. They worked from dawn to dusk. Without the stair, there was no way to reach the top of the Wall save by winch. That would not serve if the wildlings should attack again.\nAbove the King\u2019s Tower the great golden battle standard of House Baratheon cracked like a whip from the roof where Jon Snow had prowled with bow in hand not long ago, slaying Thenns and free folk beside Satin and Deaf Dick Follard. Two queen\u2019s men stood shivering on the steps, their hands tucked up into their armpits and their spears leaning against the door. \u201cThose cloth gloves will never serve,\u201d Jon told them. \u201cSee Bowen Marsh on the morrow, and he\u2019ll give you each a pair of leather gloves lined with fur.\u201d\n\u201cWe will, m\u2019lord, and thank you,\u201d said the older guard.\n\u201cThat\u2019s if our bloody hands aren\u2019t froze off,\u201d the younger added, his breath a pale mist. \u201cI used to think that it got cold up in the Dornish Marches. What did I know?\u201d\nNothing, thought Jon Snow, the same as me.\nHalfway up the winding steps, he came upon Samwell Tarly, headed down. \u201cAre you coming from the king?\u201d Jon asked him.\n\u201cMaester Aemon sent me with a letter.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Some lords trusted their maesters to read their letters and convey the contents, but Stannis insisted on breaking the seals himself. \u201cHow did Stannis take it?\u201d\n\u201cNot happily, by his face.\u201d Sam dropped his voice to a whisper. \u201cI am not supposed to speak of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d Jon wondered which of his father\u2019s bannermen had refused King Stannis homage this time. He was quick enough to spread the word when Karhold declared for him. \u201cHow are you and your longbow getting on?\u201d\n\u201cI found a good book about archery.\u201d Sam frowned. \u201cDoing it is harder than reading about it, though. I get blisters.\u201d\n\u201cKeep at it. We may need your bow on the Wall if the Others turn up some dark night.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I hope not.\u201d\nMore guards stood outside the king\u2019s solar. \u201cNo arms are allowed in His Grace\u2019s presence, my lord,\u201d their serjeant said. \u201cI\u2019ll need that sword. Your knives as well.\u201d It would do no good to protest, Jon knew. He handed them his weaponry.\nWithin the solar the air was warm. Lady Melisandre was seated near the fire, her ruby glimmering against the pale skin of her throat. Ygritte had been kissed by fire; the red priestess was fire, and her hair was blood and flame. Stannis stood behind the rough-hewn table where the Old Bear had once been wont to sit and take his meals. Covering the table was a large map of the north, painted on a ragged piece of hide. A tallow candle weighed down one end of it, a steel gauntlet the other.\nThe king wore lambswool breeches and a quilted doublet, yet somehow he looked as stiff and uncomfortable as if he had been clad in plate and mail. His skin was pale leather, his beard cropped so short that it might have been painted on. A fringe about his temples was all that remained of his black hair. In his hand was a parchment with a broken seal of dark green wax.\nJon took a knee. The king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily. \u201cRise. Tell me, who is Lyanna Mormont?\u201d\n\u201cOne of Lady Maege\u2019s daughters, Sire. The youngest. She was named for my lord father\u2019s sister.\u201d\n\u201cTo curry your lord father\u2019s favor, I don\u2019t doubt. I know how that game is played. How old is this wretched girl child?\u201d\nJon had to think a moment. \u201cTen. Or near enough to make no matter. Might I know how she has offended Your Grace?\u201d\nStannis read from the letter. \u201cBear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK. A girl of ten, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king.\u201d His close-cropped beard lay like a shadow over his hollow cheeks. \u201cSee that you keep these tidings to yourself, Lord Snow. Karhold is with me, that is all the men need know. I will not have your brothers trading tales of how this child spat on me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, Sire.\u201d Maege Mormont had ridden south with Robb, Jon knew. Her eldest daughter had joined the Young Wolf\u2019s host as well. Even if both of them had died, however, Lady Maege had other daughters, some with children of their own. Had they gone with Robb as well? Surely Lady Maege would have left at least one of the older girls behind as castellan. He did not understand why Lyanna should be writing Stannis, and could not help but wonder if the girl\u2019s answer might have been different if the letter had been sealed with a direwolf instead of a crowned stag, and signed by Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. It is too late for such misgivings. You made your choice.\n\u201cTwo score ravens were sent out,\u201d the king complained, \u201cyet we get no response but silence and defiance. Homage is the duty every leal subject owes his king. Yet your father\u2019s bannermen all turn their back on me, save the Karstarks. Is Arnolf Karstark the only man of honor in the north?\u201d\nArnolf Karstark was the late Lord Rickard\u2019s uncle. He had been made the castellan of Karhold when his nephew and his sons went south with Robb, and he had been the first to respond to King Stannis\u2019s call for homage, with a raven declaring his allegiance. The Karstarks have no other choice, Jon might have said. Rickard Karstark had betrayed the direwolf and spilled the blood of lions. The stag was Karhold\u2019s only hope. \u201cIn times as confused as these, even men of honor must wonder where their duty lies. Your Grace is not the only king in the realm demanding homage.\u201d\nLady Melisandre stirred. \u201cTell me, Lord Snow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where were these other kings when the wild people stormed your Wall?\u201d\n\u201cA thousand leagues away and deaf to our need,\u201d Jon replied. \u201cI have not forgotten that, my lady. Nor will I. But my father\u2019s bannermen have wives and children to protect, and smallfolk who will die should they choose wrongly. His Grace asks much of them. Give them time, and you will have your answers.\u201d\n\u201cAnswers such as this?\u201d Stannis crushed Lyanna\u2019s letter in his fist.\n\u201cEven in the north men fear the wroth of Tywin Lannister. Boltons make bad enemies as well. It is not happenstance that put a flayed man on their banners. They north rode with Robb, bled with him, died for him. They have supped on grief and death, and now you come to offer them another serving. Do you blame them if they hang back? Forgive me, Your Grace, but some will look at you and see only another doomed pretender.\u201d\n\u201cIf His Grace is doomed, your realm is doomed as well,\u201d said Lady Melisandre. \u201cRemember that, Lord Snow. It is the one true king of Westeros who stands before you.\u201d\nJon kept his face a mask. \u201cAs you say, my lady.\u201d\nStannis snorted. \u201cYou spend your words as if every one were a golden dragon. I wonder, how much gold do you have laid by?\u201d\n\u201cGold?\u201d Are those the dragons the red woman means to wake? Dragons made of gold? \u201cSuch taxes as we collect are paid in kind, Your Grace. The Watch is rich in turnips but poor in coin.\u201d\n\u201cTurnips are not like to appease Salladhor Saan. I require gold or silver.\u201d\n\u201cFor that, you need White Harbor. The city cannot compare to Oldtown or King\u2019s Landing, but it is still a thriving port. Lord Manderly is the richest of my lord father\u2019s bannermen.\u201d\n\u201cLord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse.\u201d The letter that Lord Wyman Manderly had sent back from White Harbor had spoken of his age and infirmity, and little more. Stannis had commanded Jon not to speak of that one either.\n\u201cPerhaps his lordship would fancy a wildling wife,\u201d said Lady Melisandre. \u201cIs this fat man married, Lord Snow?\u201d\n\u201cHis lady wife is long dead. Lord Wyman has two grown sons, and grandchildren by the elder. And he is too fat to sit a horse, thirty stone at least. Val would never have him.\u201d\n\u201cJust once you might try to give me an answer that would please me, Lord Snow,\u201d the king grumbled.\n\u201cI would hope the truth would please you, Sire. Your men call Val a princess, but to the free folk she is only the sister of their king\u2019s dead wife. If you force her to marry a man she does not want, she is like to slit his throat on their wedding night. Even if she accepts her husband, that does not mean the wildlings will follow him, or you. The only man who can bind them to your cause is Mance Rayder.\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Stannis said, unhappily. \u201cI have spent hours speaking with the man. He knows much and more of our true enemy, and there is cunning in him, I\u2019ll grant you. Even if he were to renounce his kingship, though, the man remains an oathbreaker. Suffer one deserter to live, and you encourage others to desert. No. Laws should be made of iron, not of pudding. Mance Rayder\u2019s life is forfeit by every law of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\n\u201cThe law ends at the Wall, Your Grace. You could make good use of Mance.\u201d\n\u201cI mean to. I\u2019ll burn him, and the north will see how I deal with turncloaks and traitors. I have other men to lead the wildlings. And I have Rayder\u2019s son, do not forget. Once the father dies, his whelp will be the King-Beyond-the-Wall.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace is mistaken.\u201d You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte used to say, but he had learned. \u201cThe babe is no more a prince than Val is a princess. You do not become King-Beyond-the-Wall because your father was.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Stannis, \u201cfor I will suffer no other kings in Westeros. Have you signed the grant?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d And now it comes. Jon closed his burned fingers and opened them again. \u201cYou ask too much.\u201d\n\u201cAsk? I asked you to be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I require these castles.\u201d\n\u201cWe have ceded you the Nightfort.\u201d\n\u201cRats and ruins. It is a niggard\u2019s gift that costs the giver nothing. Your own man Yarwyck says it will be half a year before the castle can be made fit for habitation.\u201d\n\u201cThe other forts are no better.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. It makes no matter. They are all we have. There are nineteen forts along the Wall, and you have men in only three of them. I mean to have every one of them garrisoned again before the year is out.\u201d\n\u201cI have no quarrel with that, Sire, but it is being said that you also mean to grant these castles to your knights and lords, to hold as their own seats as vassals to Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cKings are expected to be open-handed to their followers. Did Lord Eddard teach his bastard nothing? Many of my knights and lords abandoned rich lands and stout castles in the south. Should their loyalty go unrewarded?\u201d\n\u201cIf Your Grace wishes to lose all of my lord father\u2019s bannermen, there is no more certain way than by giving northern halls to southron lords.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I lose men I do not have? I had hoped to bestow Winterfell on a northman, you may recall. A son of Eddard Stark. He threw my offer in my face.\u201d Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters.\n\u201cBy right Winterfell should go to my sister Sansa.\u201d\n\u201cLady Lannister, you mean? Are you so eager to see the Imp perched on your father\u2019s seat? I promise you, that will not happen whilst I live, Lord Snow.\u201d\nJon knew better than to press the point. \u201cSire, some claim that you mean to grant lands and castles to Rattleshirt and the Magnar of Thenn.\u201d\n\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\nThe talk was all over Castle Black. \u201cIf you must know, I had the tale from Gilly.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Gilly?\u201d\n\u201cThe wet nurse,\u201d said Lady Melisandre. \u201cYour Grace gave her freedom of the castle.\u201d\n\u201cNot for running tales. She\u2019s wanted for her teats, not for her tongue. I\u2019ll have more milk from her, and fewer messages.\u201d\n\u201cCastle Black needs no useless mouths,\u201d Jon agreed. \u201cI am sending Gilly south on the next ship out of Eastwatch.\u201d\nMelisandre touched the ruby at her neck. \u201cGilly is giving suck to Dalla\u2019s son as well as her own. It seems cruel of you to part our little prince from his milk brother, my lord.\u201d\nCareful now, careful. \u201cMother\u2019s milk is all they share. Gilly\u2019s son is larger and more robust. He kicks the prince and pinches him, and shoves him from the breast. Craster was his father, a cruel man and greedy, and blood tells.\u201d\nThe king was confused. \u201cI thought the wet nurse was this man Craster\u2019s daughter?\u201d\n\u201cWife and daughter both, Your Grace. Craster married all his daughters. Gilly\u2019s boy was the fruit of their union.\u201d\n\u201cHer own father got this child on her?\u201d Stannis sounded shocked. \u201cWe are well rid of her, then. I will not suffer such abominations here. This is not King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\n\u201cI can find another wet nurse. If there\u2019s none amongst the wildlings, I will send to the mountain clans. Until such time, goat\u2019s milk should suffice for the boy, if it please Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cPoor fare for a prince\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but better than whore\u2019s milk, aye.\u201d Stannis drummed his fingers on the map. \u201cIf we may return to the matter of these forts\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Jon, with chilly courtesy, \u201cI have housed your men and fed them, at dire cost to our winter stores. I have clothed them so they would not freeze.\u201d\nStannis was not appeased. \u201cAye, you\u2019ve shared your salt pork and porridge, and you\u2019ve thrown us some black rags to keep us warm. Rags the wildlings would have taken off your corpses if I had not come north.\u201d\nJon ignored that. \u201cI have given you fodder for your horses, and once the stair is done I will lend you builders to restore the Nightfort. I have even agreed to allow you to settle wildlings on the Gift, which was given to the Night\u2019s Watch in perpetuity.\u201d\n\u201cYou offer me empty lands and desolations, yet deny me the castles I require to reward my lords and bannermen.\u201d\n\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch built those castles\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Night\u2019s Watch abandoned them.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0to defend the Wall,\u201d Jon finished stubbornly, \u201cnot as seats for southron lords. The stones of those forts are mortared with the blood and bones of my brothers, long dead. I cannot give them to you.\u201d\n\u201cCannot or will not?\u201d The cords in the king\u2019s neck stood out sharp as swords. \u201cI offered you a name.\u201d\n\u201cI have a name, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cSnow. Was ever a name more ill-omened?\u201d Stannis touched his sword hilt. \u201cJust who do you imagine that you are?\u201d\n\u201cThe watcher on the walls. The sword in the darkness.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t prate your words at me.\u201d Stannis drew the blade he called Lightbringer. \u201cHere is your sword in the darkness.\u201d Light rippled up and down the blade, now red, now yellow, now orange, painting the king\u2019s face in harsh, bright hues. \u201cEven a green boy should be able to see that. Are you blind?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Sire. I agree these castles must be garrisoned\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe boy commander agrees. How fortunate.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014by the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not have the men.\u201d\n\u201cThen give me men, Sire. I will provide officers for each of the abandoned forts, seasoned commanders who know the Wall and the lands beyond, and how best to survive the coming winter. In return for all we\u2019ve given you, grant me the men to fill out the garrisons. Men-at-arms, crossbowmen, raw boys. I will even take your wounded and infirm.\u201d\nStannis stared at him incredulously, then gave a bark of laughter. \u201cYou are bold enough, Snow, I grant you that, but you\u2019re mad if you think my men will take the black.\u201d\n\u201cThey can wear any color cloak they choose, so long as they obey my officers as they would your own.\u201d\nThe king was unmoved. \u201cI have knights and lords in my service, scions of noble Houses old in honor. They cannot be expected to serve under poachers, peasants, and murderers.\u201d\nOr bastards, Sire? \u201cYour own Hand is a smuggler.\u201d\n\u201cWas a smuggler. I shortened his fingers for that. They tell me that you are the nine-hundred-ninety-eighth man to command the Night\u2019s Watch, Lord Snow. What do you think the nine-hundred-ninety-ninth might say about these castles? The sight of your head on a spike might inspire him to be more helpful.\u201d The king laid his bright blade down on the map, along the Wall, its steel shimmering like sunlight on water. \u201cYou are only lord commander by my sufferance. You would do well to remember that.\u201d\n\u201cI am lord commander because my brothers chose me.\u201d There were mornings when Jon Snow did not quite believe it himself, when he woke up thinking surely this was some mad dream. It\u2019s like putting on new clothes, Sam had told him. The fit feels strange at first, but once you\u2019ve worn them for a while you get to feeling comfortable.\n\u201cAlliser Thorne complains about the manner of your choosing, and I cannot say he does not have a grievance.\u201d The map lay between them like a battleground, drenched by the colors of the glowing sword. \u201cThe count was done by a blind man with your fat friend by his elbow. And Slynt names you a turncloak.\u201d\nAnd who would know one better than Slynt? \u201cA turncloak would tell you what you wished to hear and betray you later. Your Grace knows that I was fairly chosen. My father always said you were a just man.\u201d Just but harsh had been Lord Eddard\u2019s exact words, but Jon did not think it would be wise to share that.\n\u201cLord Eddard was no friend to me, but he was not without some sense. He would have given me these castles.\u201d\nNever. \u201cI cannot speak to what my father might have done. I took an oath, Your Grace. The Wall is mine.\u201d\n\u201cFor now. We will see how well you hold it.\u201d Stannis pointed at him. \u201cKeep your ruins, as they mean so much to you. I promise you, though, if any remain empty when the year is out, I will take them with your leave or without it. And if even one should fall to the foe, your head will soon follow. Now get out.\u201d\nLady Melisandre rose from her place near the hearth. \u201cWith your leave, Sire, I will show Lord Snow back to his chambers.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? He knows the way.\u201d Stannis waved them both away. \u201cDo what you will. Devan, food. Boiled eggs and lemon water.\u201d\nAfter the warmth of the king\u2019s solar, the turnpike stair felt bone-chillingly cold. \u201cWind\u2019s rising, m\u2019lady,\u201d the serjeant warned Melisandre as he handed Jon back his weapons. \u201cYou might want a warmer cloak.\u201d\n\u201cI have my faith to warm me.\u201d The red woman walked beside Jon down the steps. \u201cHis Grace is growing fond of you.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell. He only threatened to behead me twice.\u201d\nMelisandre laughed. \u201cIt is his silences you should fear, not his words.\u201d As they stepped out into the yard, the wind filled Jon\u2019s cloak and sent it flapping against her. The red priestess brushed the black wool aside and slipped her arm through his. \u201cIt may be that you are not wrong about the wildling king. I shall pray for the Lord of Light to send me guidance. When I gaze into the flames, I can see through stone and earth, and find the truth within men\u2019s souls. I can speak to kings long dead and children not yet born, and watch the years and seasons flicker past, until the end of days.\u201d\n\u201cAre your fires never wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNever\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though we priests are mortal and sometimes err, mistaking this must come for this may come.\u201d\nJon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather. The sight of them arm in arm was drawing curious looks. They will be whispering in the barracks tonight. \u201cIf you can truly see the morrow in your flames, tell me when and where the next wildling attack will come.\u201d He slipped his arm free.\n\u201cR\u2019hllor sends us what visions he will, but I shall seek for this man Tormund in the flames.\u201d Melisandre\u2019s red lips curled into a smile. \u201cI have seen you in my fires, Jon Snow.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a threat, my lady? Do you mean to burn me too?\u201d\n\u201cYou mistake my meaning.\u201d She gave him a searching look. \u201cI fear that I make you uneasy, Lord Snow.\u201d\nJon did not deny it. \u201cThe Wall is no place for a woman.\u201d\n\u201cYou are wrong. I have dreamed of your Wall, Jon Snow. Great was the lore that raised it, and great the spells locked beneath its ice. We walk beneath one of the hinges of the world.\u201d Melisandre gazed up at it, her breath a warm moist cloud in the air. \u201cThis is my place as it is yours, and soon enough you may have grave need of me. Do not refuse my friendship, Jon. I have seen you in the storm, hard-pressed, with enemies on every side. You have so many enemies. Shall I tell you their names?\u201d\n\u201cI know their names.\u201d\n\u201cDo not be so certain.\u201d The ruby at Melisandre\u2019s throat gleamed red. \u201cIt is not the foes who curse you to your face that you must fear, but those who smile when you are looking and sharpen their knives when you turn your back. You would do well to keep your wolf close beside you. Ice, I see, and daggers in the dark. Blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel. It was very cold.\u201d\n\u201cIt is always cold on the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u201cI know so, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cThen you know nothing, Jon Snow,\u201d she whispered.",

      "content": "BRAN\nAre we there yet?\nBran never said the words aloud, but they were often on his lips as their ragged company trudged through groves of ancient oaks and towering grey-green sentinels, past gloomy soldier pines and bare brown chestnut trees. Are we near? the boy would wonder, as Hodor clambered up a stony slope, or descended into some dark crevice where drifts of dirty snow cracked beneath his feet. How much farther? he would think, as the great elk splashed across a half-frozen stream. How much longer? It\u2019s so cold. Where is the three-eyed crow?\nSwaying in his wicker basket on Hodor\u2019s back, the boy hunched down, ducking his head as the big stableboy passed beneath the limb of an oak. The snow was falling again, wet and heavy. Hodor walked with one eye frozen shut, his thick brown beard a tangle of hoarfrost, icicles drooping from the ends of his bushy mustache. One gloved hand still clutched the rusty iron longsword he had taken from the crypts below Winterfell, and from time to time he would lash out at a branch, knocking loose a spray of snow. \u201cHod-d-d-dor,\u201d he would mutter, his teeth chattering.\nThe sound was strangely reassuring. On their journey from Winterfell to the Wall, Bran and his companions had made the miles shorter by talking and telling tales, but it was different here. Even Hodor felt it. His hodors came less often than they had south of the Wall. There was a stillness to this wood like nothing Bran had ever known before. Before the snows began, the north wind would swirl around them and clouds of dead brown leaves would kick up from the ground with a faint small rustling sound that reminded him of roaches scurrying in a cupboard, but now all the leaves were buried under a blanket of white. From time to time a raven would fly overhead, big black wings slapping against the cold air. Elsewise the world was silent.\nJust ahead, the elk wove between the snowdrifts with his head down, his huge rack of antlers crusted with ice. The ranger sat astride his broad back, grim and silent. Coldhands was the name that the fat boy Sam had given him, for though the ranger\u2019s face was pale, his hands were black and hard as iron, and cold as iron too. The rest of him was wrapped in layers of wool and boiled leather and ringmail, his features shadowed by his hooded cloak and a black woolen scarf about the lower half of his face.\nBehind the ranger, Meera Reed wrapped her arms around her brother, to shelter him from the wind and cold with the warmth of her own body. A crust of frozen snot had formed below Jojen\u2019s nose, and from time to time he shivered violently. He looks so small, Bran thought, as he watched him sway. He looks smaller than me now, and weaker too, and I\u2019m the cripple.\nSummer brought up the rear of their little band. The direwolf\u2019s breath frosted the forest air as he padded after them, still limping on the hind leg that had taken the arrow back at Queenscrown. Bran felt the pain of the old wound whenever he slipped inside the big wolf\u2019s skin. Of late Bran wore Summer\u2019s body more often than his own; the wolf felt the bite of the cold, despite the thickness of his fur, but he could see farther and hear better and smell more than the boy in the basket, bundled up like a babe in swaddling clothes.\nOther times, when he was tired of being a wolf, Bran slipped into Hodor\u2019s skin instead. The gentle giant would whimper when he felt him, and thrash his shaggy head from side to side, but not as violently as he had the first time, back at Queenscrown. He knows it\u2019s me, the boy liked to tell himself. He\u2019s used to me by now. Even so, he never felt comfortable inside Hodor\u2019s skin. The big stableboy never understood what was happening, and Bran could taste the fear at the back of his mouth. It was better inside Summer. I am him, and he is me. He feels what I feel.\nSometimes Bran could sense the direwolf sniffing after the elk, wondering if he could bring the great beast down. Summer had grown accustomed to horses at Winterfell, but this was an elk and elk were prey. The direwolf could sense the warm blood coursing beneath the elk\u2019s shaggy hide. Just the smell was enough to make the slaver run from between his jaws, and when it did Bran\u2019s mouth would water at the thought of rich, dark meat.\nFrom a nearby oak a raven quorked, and Bran heard the sound of wings as another of the big black birds flapped down to land beside it. By day only half a dozen ravens stayed with them, flitting from tree to tree or riding on the antlers of the elk. The rest of the murder flew ahead or lingered behind. But when the sun sank low they would return, descending from the sky on night-black wings until every branch of every tree was thick with them for yards around. Some would fly to the ranger and mutter at him, and it seemed to Bran that he understood their quorks and squawks. They are his eyes and ears. They scout for him, and whisper to him of dangers ahead and behind.\nAs now. The elk stopped suddenly, and the ranger vaulted lightly from his back to land in knee-deep snow. Summer growled at him, his fur bristling. The direwolf did not like the way that Coldhands smelled. Dead meat, dry blood, a faint whiff of rot. And cold. Cold over all.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Meera wanted to know.\n\u201cBehind us,\u201d Coldhands announced, his voice muffled by the black wool scarf across his nose and mouth.\n\u201cWolves?\u201d Bran asked. They had known for days that they were being followed. Every night they heard the mournful howling of the pack, and every night the wolves seemed a little closer. Hunters, and hungry. They can smell how weak we are. Often Bran woke shivering hours before the dawn, listening to the sound of them calling to one another in the distance as he waited for the sun to rise. If there are wolves, there must be prey, he used to think, until it came to him that they were the prey.\nThe ranger shook his head. \u201cMen. The wolves still keep their distance. These men are not so shy.\u201d\nMeera Reed pushed back her hood. The wet snow that had covered it tumbled to the ground with a soft thump. \u201cHow many men? Who are they?\u201d\n\u201cFoes. I\u2019ll deal with them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay. The boy must be protected. There is a lake ahead, hard frozen. When you come on it, turn north and follow the shoreline. You\u2019ll come to a fishing village. Take refuge there until I can catch up with you.\u201d\nBran thought that Meera meant to argue until her brother said, \u201cDo as he says. He knows this land.\u201d Jojen\u2019s eyes were a dark green, the color of moss, but heavy with a weariness that Bran had never seen in them before. The little grandfather. South of the Wall, the boy from the crannogs had seemed to be wise beyond his years, but up here he was as lost and frightened as the rest of them. Even so, Meera always listened to him.\nThat was still true. Coldhands slipped between the trees, back the way they\u2019d come, with four ravens flapping after him. Meera watched him go, her cheeks red with cold, breath puffing from her nostrils. She pulled her hood back up and gave the elk a nudge, and their trek resumed. Before they had gone twenty yards, though, she turned to glance behind them and said, \u201cMen, he says. What men? Does he mean wildlings? Why won\u2019t he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he\u2019d go and deal with them,\u201d said Bran.\n\u201cHe said, aye. He said he would take us to this three-eyed crow too. That river we crossed this morning is the same one we crossed four days ago, I swear. We\u2019re going in circles.\u201d\n\u201cRivers turn and twist,\u201d Bran said uncertainly, \u201cand where there\u2019s lakes and hills, you need to go around.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been too much going around,\u201d Meera insisted, \u201cand too many secrets. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like him. And I don\u2019t trust him. Those hands of his are bad enough. He hides his face, and will not speak a name. Who is he? What is he? Anyone can put on a black cloak. Anyone, or any thing. He does not eat, he never drinks, he does not seem to feel the cold.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. Bran had been afraid to speak of it, but he had noticed. Whenever they took shelter for the night, while he and Hodor and the Reeds huddled together for warmth, the ranger kept apart. Sometimes Coldhands closed his eyes, but Bran did not think he slept. And there was something else\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cThe scarf.\u201d Bran glanced about uneasily, but there was not a raven to be seen. All the big black birds had left them when the ranger did. No one was listening. Even so, he kept his voice low. \u201cThe scarf over his mouth, it never gets all hard with ice, like Hodor\u2019s beard. Not even when he talks.\u201d\nMeera gave him a sharp look. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve never seen his breath, have we?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d A puff of white heralded each of Hodor\u2019s hodors. When Jojen or his sister spoke, their words could be seen too. Even the elk left a warm fog upon the air when he exhaled.\n\u201cIf he does not breathe\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nBran found himself remembering the tales Old Nan had told him when he was a babe. Beyond the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, she would say, tucking him in beneath his scratchy woolen blanket, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong and the men of the Night\u2019s Watch are true. So go to sleep, my little Brandon, my baby boy, and dream sweet dreams. There are no monsters here. The ranger wore the black of the Night\u2019s Watch, but what if he was not a man at all? What if he was some monster, taking them to the other monsters to be devoured?\n\u201cThe ranger saved Sam and the girl from the wights,\u201d Bran said, hesitantly, \u201cand he\u2019s taking me to the three-eyed crow.\u201d\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t this three-eyed crow come to us? Why couldn\u2019t he meet us at the Wall? Crows have wings. My brother grows weaker every day. How long can we go on?\u201d\nJojen coughed. \u201cUntil we get there.\u201d\nThey came upon the promised lake not long after, and turned north as the ranger had bid them. That was the easy part.\nThe water was frozen, and the snow had been falling for so long that Bran had lost count of the days, turning the lake into a vast white wilderness. Where the ice was flat and the ground was bumpy, the going was easy, but where the wind had pushed the snow up into ridges, sometimes it was hard to tell where the lake ended and the shore began. Even the trees were not as infallible a guide as they might have hoped, for there were wooded islands in the lake, and wide areas ashore where no trees grew.\nThe elk went where he would, regardless of the wishes of Meera and Jojen on his back. Mostly he stayed beneath the trees, but where the shore curved away westward he would take the more direct path across the frozen lake, shouldering through snowdrifts taller than Bran as the ice crackled underneath his hooves. Out there the wind was stronger, a cold north wind that howled across the lake, knifed through their layers of wool and leather, and set them all to shivering. When it blew into their faces, it would drive the snow into their eyes and leave them as good as blind.\nHours passed in silence. Ahead, shadows began to steal between the trees, the long fingers of the dusk. Dark came early this far north. Bran had come to dread that. Each day seemed shorter than the last, and where the days were cold, the nights were bitter cruel.\nMeera halted them again. \u201cWe should have come on the village by now.\u201d Her voice sounded hushed and strange.\n\u201cCould we have passed it?\u201d Bran asked.\n\u201cI hope not. We need to find shelter before nightfall.\u201d\nShe was not wrong. Jojen\u2019s lips were blue, Meera\u2019s cheeks dark red. Bran\u2019s own face had gone numb. Hodor\u2019s beard was solid ice. Snow caked his legs almost to the knee, and Bran had felt him stagger more than once. No one was as strong as Hodor, no one. If even his great strength was failing\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cSummer can find the village,\u201d Bran said suddenly, his words misting in the air. He did not wait to hear what Meera might say, but closed his eyes and let himself flow from his broken body.\nAs he slipped inside Summer\u2019s skin, the dead woods came to sudden life. Where before there had been silence, now he heard: wind in the trees, Hodor\u2019s breathing, the elk pawing at the ground in search of fodder. Familiar scents filled his nostrils: wet leaves and dead grass, the rotted carcass of a squirrel decaying in the brush, the sour stink of man-sweat, the musky odor of the elk. Food. Meat. The elk sensed his interest. He turned his head toward the direwolf, wary, and lowered his great antlers.\nHe is not prey, the boy whispered to the beast who shared his skin. Leave him. Run.\nSummer ran. Across the lake he raced, his paws kicking up sprays of snow behind him. The trees stood shoulder to shoulder, like men in a battle line, all cloaked in white. Over roots and rocks the direwolf sped, through a drift of old snow, the crust crackling beneath his weight. His paws grew wet and cold. The next hill was covered with pines, and the sharp scent of their needles filled the air. When he reached the top, he turned in a circle, sniffing at the air, then raised his head and howled.\nThe smells were there. Mansmells.\nAshes, Bran thought, old and faint, but ashes. It was the smell of burnt wood, soot, and charcoal. A dead fire.\nHe shook the snow off his muzzle. The wind was gusting, so the smells were hard to follow. The wolf turned this way and that, sniffing. All around were heaps of snow and tall trees garbed in white. The wolf let his tongue loll out between his teeth, tasting the frigid air, his breath misting as snowflakes melted on his tongue. When he trotted toward the scent, Hodor lumbered after him at once. The elk took longer to decide, so Bran returned reluctantly to his own body and said, \u201cThat way. Follow Summer. I smelled it.\u201d\nAs the first sliver of a crescent moon came peeking through the clouds, they finally stumbled into the village by the lake. They had almost walked straight through it. From the ice, the village looked no different than a dozen other spots along the lakeshore. Buried under drifts of snow, the round stone houses could just as easily have been boulders or hillocks or fallen logs, like the deadfall that Jojen had mistaken for a building the day before, until they dug down into it and found only broken branches and rotting logs.\nThe village was empty, abandoned by the wildlings who had once lived there, like all the other villages they had passed. Some had been burned, as if the inhabitants had wanted to make certain they could not come creeping back, but this one had been spared the torch. Beneath the snow they found a dozen huts and a longhall, with its sod roof and thick walls of rough-hewn logs.\n\u201cAt least we will be out of the wind,\u201d Bran said.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor.\nMeera slid down from the elk\u2019s back. She and her brother helped lift Bran out of the wicker basket. \u201cMight be the wildlings left some food behind,\u201d she said.\nThat proved a forlorn hope. Inside the longhall they found the ashes of a fire, floors of hard-packed dirt, a chill that went bone deep. But at least they had a roof above their heads and log walls to keep the wind off. A stream ran nearby, covered with a film of ice. The elk had to crack it with his hoof to drink. Once Bran and Jojen and Hodor were safely settled, Meera fetched back some chunks of broken ice for them to suck on. The melting water was so cold it made Bran shudder.\nSummer did not follow them into the longhall. Bran could feel the big wolf\u2019s hunger, a shadow of his own. \u201cGo hunt,\u201d he told him, \u201cbut you leave the elk alone.\u201d Part of him was wishing he could go hunting too. Perhaps he would, later.\nSupper was a fistful of acorns, crushed and pounded into paste, so bitter that Bran gagged as he tried to keep it down. Jojen Reed did not even make the attempt. Younger and frailer than his sister, he was growing weaker by the day.\n\u201cJojen, you have to eat,\u201d Meera told him.\n\u201cLater. I just want to rest.\u201d Jojen smiled a wan smile. \u201cThis is not the day I die, sister. I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cYou almost fell off the elk.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost. I am cold and hungry, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cThen eat.\u201d\n\u201cCrushed acorns? My belly hurts, but that will only make it worse. Leave me be, sister. I\u2019m dreaming of roast chicken.\u201d\n\u201cDreams will not sustain you. Not even greendreams.\u201d\n\u201cDreams are what we have.\u201d\nAll we have. The last of the food that they had brought from the south was ten days gone. Since then hunger walked beside them day and night. Even Summer could find no game in these woods. They lived on crushed acorns and raw fish. The woods were full of frozen streams and cold black lakes, and Meera was as good a fisher with her three-pronged frog spear as most men were with hook and line. Some days her lips were blue with cold by the time she waded back to them with her catch wriggling on her tines. It had been three days since Meera caught a fish, however. Bran\u2019s belly felt so hollow it might have been three years.\nAfter they choked down their meagre supper, Meera sat with her back against a wall, sharpening her dagger on a whetstone. Hodor squatted down beside the door, rocking back and forth on his haunches and muttering, \u201cHodor, hodor, hodor.\u201d\nBran closed his eyes. It was too cold to talk, and they dare not light a fire. Coldhands had warned them against that. These woods are not as empty as you think, he had said. You cannot know what the light might summon from the darkness. The memory made him shiver, despite the warmth of Hodor beside him.\nSleep would not come, could not come. Instead there was wind, the biting cold, moonlight on snow, and fire. He was back inside Summer, long leagues away, and the night was rank with the smell of blood. The scent was strong. A kill, not far. The flesh would still be warm. Slaver ran between his teeth as the hunger woke inside him. Not elk. Not deer. Not this.\nThe direwolf moved toward the meat, a gaunt grey shadow sliding from tree to tree, through pools of moonlight and over mounds of snow. The wind gusted around him, shifting. He lost the scent, found it, then lost it again. As he searched for it once more, a distant sound made his ears prick up.\nWolf, he knew at once. Summer stalked toward the sound, wary now. Soon enough the scent of blood was back, but now there were other smells: piss and dead skins, bird shit, feathers, and wolf, wolf, wolf. A pack. He would need to fight for his meat.\nThey smelled him too. As he moved out from amongst the darkness of the trees into the bloody glade, they were watching him. The female was chewing on a leather boot that still had half a leg in it, but she let it fall at his approach. The leader of the pack, an old male with a grizzled white muzzle and a blind eye, moved out to meet him, snarling, his teeth bared. Behind him, a younger male showed his fangs as well.\nThe direwolf\u2019s pale yellow eyes drank in the sights around them. A nest of entrails coiled through a bush, entangled with the branches. Steam rising from an open belly, rich with the smells of blood and meat. A head staring sightlessly up at a horned moon, cheeks ripped and torn down to bloody bone, pits for eyes, neck ending in a ragged stump. A pool of frozen blood, glistening red and black.\nMen. The stink of them filled the world. Alive, they had been as many as the fingers on a man\u2019s paw, but now they were none. Dead. Done. Meat. Cloaked and hooded, once, but the wolves had torn their clothing into pieces in their frenzy to get at the flesh. Those who still had faces wore thick beards crusted with ice and frozen snot. The falling snow had begun to bury what remained of them, so pale against the black of ragged cloaks and breeches. Black.\nLong leagues away, the boy stirred uneasily.\nBlack. Night\u2019s Watch. They were Night\u2019s Watch.\nThe direwolf did not care. They were meat. He was hungry.\nThe eyes of the three wolves glowed yellow. The direwolf swung his head from side to side, nostrils flaring, then bared his fangs in a snarl. The younger male backed away. The direwolf could smell the fear in him. Tail, he knew. But the one-eyed wolf answered with a growl and moved to block his advance. Head. And he does not fear me though I am twice his size.\nTheir eyes met.\nWarg!\nThen the two rushed together, wolf and direwolf, and there was no more time for thought. The world shrank down to tooth and claw, snow flying as they rolled and spun and tore at one another, the other wolves snarling and snapping around them. His jaws closed on matted fur slick with hoarfrost, on a limb thin as a dry stick, but the one-eyed wolf clawed at his belly and tore himself free, rolled, lunged for him. Yellow fangs snapped closed on his throat, but he shook off his old grey cousin as he would a rat, then charged after him, knocked him down. Rolling, ripping, kicking, they fought until the both of them were ragged and fresh blood dappled the snows around them. But finally the old one-eyed wolf lay down and showed his belly. The direwolf snapped at him twice more, sniffed at his butt, then lifted a leg over him.\nA few snaps and a warning growl, and the female and the tail submitted too. The pack was his.\nThe prey as well. He went from man to man, sniffing, before settling on the biggest, a faceless thing who clutched black iron in one hand. His other hand was missing, severed at the wrist, the stump bound up in leather. Blood flowed thick and sluggish from the slash across his throat. The wolf lapped at it with his tongue, licked the ragged eyeless ruin of his nose and cheeks, then buried his muzzle in his neck and tore it open, gulping down a gobbet of sweet meat. No flesh had ever tasted half as good.\nWhen he was done with that one, he moved to the next, and devoured the choicest bits of that man too. Ravens watched him from the trees, squatting dark-eyed and silent on the branches as snow drifted down around them. The other wolves made do with his leavings; the old male fed first, then the female, then the tail. They were his now. They were pack.\nNo, the boy whispered, we have another pack. Lady\u2019s dead and maybe Grey Wind too, but somewhere there\u2019s still Shaggydog and Nymeria and Ghost. Remember Ghost?\nFalling snow and feasting wolves began to dim. Warmth beat against his face, comforting as a mother\u2019s kisses. Fire, he thought, smoke. His nose twitched to the smell of roasting meat. And then the forest fell away, and he was back in the longhall again, back in his broken body, staring at a fire. Meera Reed was turning a chunk of raw red flesh above the flames, letting it char and spit. \u201cJust in time,\u201d she said. Bran rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand and wriggled backwards against the wall to sit. \u201cYou almost slept through supper. The ranger found a sow.\u201d\nBehind her, Hodor was tearing eagerly at a chunk of hot charred flesh as blood and grease ran down into his beard. Wisps of smoke rose from between his fingers. \u201cHodor,\u201d he muttered between bites, \u201chodor, hodor.\u201d His sword lay on the earthen floor beside him. Jojen Reed nipped at his own joint with small bites, chewing each chunk of meat a dozen times before swallowing.\nThe ranger killed a pig. Coldhands stood beside the door, a raven on his arm, both staring at the fire. Reflections from the flames glittered off four black eyes. He does not eat, Bran remembered, and he fears the flames.\n\u201cYou said no fire,\u201d he reminded the ranger.\n\u201cThe walls around us hide the light, and dawn is close. We will be on our way soon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to the men? The foes behind us?\u201d\n\u201cThey will not trouble you.\u201d\n\u201cWho were they? Wildlings?\u201d\nMeera turned the meat to cook the other side. Hodor was chewing and swallowing, muttering happily under his breath. Only Jojen seemed aware of what was happening as Coldhands turned his head to stare at Bran. \u201cThey were foes.\u201d\nMen of the Night\u2019s Watch. \u201cYou killed them. You and the ravens. Their faces were all torn, and their eyes were gone.\u201d Coldhands did not deny it. \u201cThey were your brothers. I saw. The wolves had ripped their clothes up, but I could still tell. Their cloaks were black. Like your hands.\u201d Coldhands said nothing. \u201cWho are you? Why are your hands black?\u201d\nThe ranger studied his hands as if he had never noticed them before. \u201cOnce the heart has ceased to beat, a man\u2019s blood runs down into his extremities, where it thickens and congeals.\u201d His voice rattled in his throat, as thin and gaunt as he was. \u201cHis hands and feet swell up and turn as black as pudding. The rest of him becomes as white as milk.\u201d\nMeera Reed rose, her frog spear in her hand, a chunk of smoking meat still impaled upon its tines. \u201cShow us your face.\u201d\nThe ranger made no move to obey.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Bran could taste the bile in his throat. \u201cMeera, he\u2019s some dead thing. The monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night\u2019s Watch stay true, that\u2019s what Old Nan used to say. He came to meet us at the Wall, but he could not pass. He sent Sam instead, with that wildling girl.\u201d\nMeera\u2019s gloved hand tightened around the shaft of her frog spear. \u201cWho sent you? Who is this three-eyed crow?\u201d\n\u201cA friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will. The last greenseer.\u201d The longhall\u2019s wooden door banged open. Outside, the night wind howled, bleak and black. The trees were full of ravens, screaming. Coldhands did not move.\n\u201cA monster,\u201d Bran said.\nThe ranger looked at Bran as if the rest of them did not exist. \u201cYour monster, Brandon Stark.\u201d\n\u201cYours,\u201d the raven echoed, from his shoulder. Outside the door, the ravens in the trees took up the cry, until the night wood echoed to the murderer\u2019s song of \u201cYours, yours, yours.\u201d\n\u201cJojen, did you dream this?\u201d Meera asked her brother. \u201cWho is he? What is he? What do we do now?\u201d\n\u201cWe go with the ranger,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cWe have come too far to turn back now, Meera. We would never make it back to the Wall alive. We go with Bran\u2019s monster, or we die.\u201d",

      "content": "TYRION\nThey departed Pentos by the Sunrise Gate, though Tyrion Lannister never glimpsed the sunrise. \u201cIt will be as if you had never come to Pentos, my little friend,\u201d promised Magister Illyrio, as he drew shut the litter\u2019s purple velvet drapes. \u201cNo man must see you leave the city, as no man saw you enter.\u201d\n\u201cNo man except the sailors who stuffed me in that barrel, the cabin boy who cleaned up after me, the girl you sent to warm my bed, and that treacherous freckled washerwoman. Oh, and your guards. Unless you removed their wits along with their balls, they know you\u2019re not alone in here.\u201d The litter was suspended between eight mammoth draft horses on heavy leather straps. Four eunuchs paced beside the horses, two to either side, and more were trudging along behind to guard the baggage train.\n\u201cUnsullied tell no tales,\u201d Illyrio assured him. \u201cAnd the galley that delivered you is on her way to Asshai even now. It will be two years before she returns, if the seas are kind. As for my household, they love me well. None would betray me.\u201d\nCherish that thought, my fat friend. One day we will carve those words upon your crypt. \u201cWe should be aboard that galley,\u201d the dwarf said. \u201cThe fastest way to Volantis is by sea.\u201d\n\u201cThe sea is hazardous,\u201d replied Illyrio. \u201cAutumn is a season rife with storms, and pirates still make their dens upon the Stepstones and venture forth to prey on honest men. It would never do for my little friend to fall into such hands.\u201d\n\u201cThere are pirates on the Rhoyne as well.\u201d\n\u201cRiver pirates.\u201d The cheesemonger gave a yawn, covering his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cCockroach captains scurrying after crumbs.\u201d\n\u201cOne hears talk of stone men as well.\u201d\n\u201cThey are real enough, poor damned things. But why speak of such things? The day is too fine for such talk. We shall see the Rhoyne soon, and there you shall be rid of Illyrio and his big belly. Till then, let us drink and dream. We have sweet wine and savories to enjoy. Why dwell upon disease and death?\u201d\nWhy indeed? Tyrion heard the thrum of a crossbow once again, and wondered. The litter swayed side to side, a soothing movement that made him feel as if he were a child being rocked to sleep in his mother\u2019s arms. Not that I would know what that was like. Silk pillows stuffed with goose down cushioned his cheeks. The purple velvet walls curved overhead to form a roof, making it pleasantly warm within despite the autumn chill outside.\nA train of mules trailed behind them, carrying chests and casks and barrels, and hampers of delectables to keep the lord of cheese from growing peckish. They nibbled on spiced sausage that morning, washed down with a dark smokeberry brown. Jellied eels and Dornish reds filled their afternoon. Come evening there were sliced hams, boiled eggs, and roasted larks stuffed with garlic and onions, with pale ales and Myrish fire wines to help in their digestion. The litter was as slow as it was comfortable, however, and the dwarf soon found himself itching with impatience.\n\u201cHow many days until we reach the river?\u201d he asked Illyrio that evening. \u201cAt this pace, your queen\u2019s dragons will be larger than Aegon\u2019s three before I can lay eyes upon them.\u201d\n\u201cWould it were so. A large dragon is more fearsome than a small one.\u201d The magister shrugged. \u201cMuch as it would please me to welcome Queen Daenerys to Volantis, I must rely on you and Griff for that. I can serve her best in Pentos, smoothing the way for her return. So long as I am with you, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, an old fat man must have his comforts, yes? Come, drink a cup of wine.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Tyrion said as he drank, \u201cwhy should a magister of Pentos give three figs who wears the crown in Westeros? Where is the gain for you in this venture, my lord?\u201d\nThe fat man dabbed grease from his lips. \u201cI am an old man, grown weary of this world and its treacheries. Is it so strange that I should wish to do some good before my days are done, to help a sweet young girl regain her birthright?\u201d\nNext you will be offering me a suit of magic armor and a palace in Valyria. \u201cIf Daenerys is no more than a sweet young girl, the Iron Throne will cut her into sweet young pieces.\u201d\n\u201cFear not, my little friend. The blood of Aegon the Dragon flows in her veins.\u201d\nAlong with the blood of Aegon the Unworthy, Maegor the Cruel, and Baelor the Befuddled. \u201cTell me more of her.\u201d\nThe fat man grew pensive. \u201cDaenerys was half a child when she came to me, yet fairer even than my second wife, so lovely I was tempted to claim her for myself. Such a fearful, furtive thing, however, I knew I should get no joy from coupling with her. Instead I summoned a bedwarmer and fucked her vigorously until the madness passed. If truth be told, I did not think Daenerys would survive for long amongst the horselords.\u201d\n\u201cThat did not stop you selling her to Khal Drogo\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDothraki neither buy nor sell. Say rather that her brother Viserys gave her to Drogo to win the khal\u2019s friendship. A vain young man, and greedy. Viserys lusted for his father\u2019s throne, but he lusted for Daenerys too, and was loath to give her up. The night before the princess wed he tried to steal into her bed, insisting that if he could not have her hand, he would claim her maidenhead. Had I not taken the precaution of posting guards upon her door, Viserys might have undone years of planning.\u201d\n\u201cHe sounds an utter fool.\u201d\n\u201cViserys was Mad Aerys\u2019s son, just so. Daenerys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Daenerys is quite different.\u201d He popped a roasted lark into his mouth and crunched it noisily, bones and all. \u201cThe frightened child who sheltered in my manse died on the Dothraki sea, and was reborn in blood and fire. This dragon queen who wears her name is a true Targaryen. When I sent ships to bring her home, she turned toward Slaver\u2019s Bay. In a short span of days she conquered Astapor, made Yunkai bend the knee, and sacked Meereen. Mantarys will be next, if she marches west along the old Valyrian roads. If she comes by sea, well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0her fleet must take on food and water at Volantis.\u201d\n\u201cBy land or by sea, there are long leagues between Meereen and Volantis,\u201d Tyrion observed.\n\u201cFive hundred fifty, as the dragon flies, through deserts, mountains, swamps, and demon-haunted ruins. Many and more will perish, but those who survive will be stronger by the time they reach Volantis\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where they shall find you and Griff awaiting them, with fresh forces and sufficient ships to carry them all across the sea to Westeros.\u201d\nTyrion pondered all he knew of Volantis, oldest and proudest of the Nine Free Cities. Something was awry here. Even with half a nose, he could smell it. \u201cIt\u2019s said there are five slaves for every free man in Volantis. Why would the triarchs assist a queen who smashed the slave trade?\u201d He pointed at Illyrio. \u201cFor that matter, why would you? Slavery may be forbidden by the laws of Pentos, yet you have a finger in that trade as well, and maybe a whole hand. And yet you conspire for the dragon queen, and not against her. Why? What do you hope to gain from Queen Daenerys?\u201d\n\u201cAre we back to that again? You are a persistent little man.\u201d Illyrio gave a laugh and slapped his belly. \u201cAs you will. The Beggar King swore that I should be his master of coin, and a lordly lord as well. Once he wore his golden crown, I should have my choice of castles\u00a0\u2026\u00a0even Casterly Rock, if I desired.\u201d\nTyrion snorted wine back up the scarred stump that had been his nose. \u201cMy father would have loved to hear that.\u201d\n\u201cYour lord father had no cause for concern. Why would I want a rock? My manse is large enough for any man, and more comfortable than your drafty Westerosi castles. Master of coin, though\u00a0\u2026\u201d The fat man peeled another egg. \u201cI am fond of coins. Is there any sound as sweet as the clink of gold on gold?\u201d\nA sister\u2019s screams. \u201cAre you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother\u2019s promises?\u201d\n\u201cShe will, or she will not.\u201d Illyrio bit the egg in half. \u201cI told you, my little friend, not all that a man does is done for gain. Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have friends, and debts of affection to repay.\u201d\nLiar, thought Tyrion. There is something in this venture worth more to you than coin or castles. \u201cYou meet so few men who value friendship over gold these days.\u201d\n\u201cToo true,\u201d the fat man said, deaf to the irony.\n\u201cHow is it that the Spider became so dear to you?\u201d\n\u201cWe were young together, two green boys in Pentos.\u201d\n\u201cVarys came from Myr.\u201d\n\u201cSo he did. I met him not long after he arrived, one step ahead of the slavers. By day he slept in the sewers, by night he prowled the rooftops like a cat. I was near as poor, a bravo in soiled silks, living by my blade. Perhaps you chanced to glimpse the statue by my pool? Pytho Malanon carved that when I was six-and-ten. A lovely thing, though now I weep to see it.\u201d\n\u201cAge makes ruins of us all. I am still in mourning for my nose. But Varys\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIn Myr he was a prince of thieves, until a rival thief informed on him. In Pentos his accent marked him, and once he was known for a eunuch he was despised and beaten. Why he chose me to protect him I may never know, but we came to an arrangement. Varys spied on lesser thieves and took their takings. I offered my help to their victims, promising to recover their valuables for a fee. Soon every man who had suffered a loss knew to come to me, whilst city\u2019s footpads and cutpurses sought out Varys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0half to slit his throat, the other half to sell him what they\u2019d stolen. We both grew rich, and richer still when Varys trained his mice.\u201d\n\u201cIn King\u2019s Landing he kept little birds.\u201d\n\u201cMice, we called them then. The older thieves were fools who thought no further than turning a night\u2019s plunder into wine. Varys preferred orphan boys and young girls. He chose the smallest, the ones who were quick and quiet, and taught them to climb walls and slip down chimneys. He taught them to read as well. We left the gold and gems for common thieves. Instead our mice stole letters, ledgers, charts\u00a0\u2026\u00a0later, they would read them and leave them where they lay. Secrets are worth more than silver or sapphires, Varys claimed. Just so. I grew so respectable that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos let me wed his maiden daughter, whilst whispers of a certain eunuch\u2019s talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain king. A very anxious king, who did not wholly trust his son, nor his wife, nor his Hand, a friend of his youth who had grown arrogant and overproud. I do believe that you know the rest of this tale, is that not so?\u201d\n\u201cMuch of it,\u201d Tyrion admitted. \u201cI see that you are somewhat more than a cheesemonger after all.\u201d\nIllyrio inclined his head. \u201cYou are kind to say so, my little friend. And for my part, I see that you are just as quick as Lord Varys claimed.\u201d He smiled, showing all his crooked yellow teeth, and shouted for another jar of Myrish fire wine.\nWhen the magister drifted off to sleep with the wine jar at his elbow, Tyrion crept across the pillows to work it loose from its fleshy prison and pour himself a cup. He drained it down, and yawned, and filled it once again. If I drink enough fire wine, he told himself, perhaps I\u2019ll dream of dragons.\nWhen he was still a lonely child in the depths of Casterly Rock, he oft rode dragons through the nights, pretending he was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord soaring high o\u2019er fields and mountains. Once, when his uncles asked him what gift he wanted for his nameday, he begged them for a dragon. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t need to be a big one. It could be little, like I am.\u201d His uncle Gerion thought that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but his uncle Tygett said, \u201cThe last dragon died a century ago, lad.\u201d That had seemed so monstrously unfair that the boy had cried himself to sleep that night.\nYet if the lord of cheese could be believed, the Mad King\u2019s daughter had hatched three living dragons. Two more than even a Targaryen should require. Tyrion was almost sorry that he had killed his father. He would have enjoyed seeing Lord Tywin\u2019s face when he learned that there was a Targaryen queen on her way to Westeros with three dragons, backed by a scheming eunuch and a cheesemonger half the size of Casterly Rock.\nThe dwarf was so stuffed that he had to undo his belt and the topmost laces on his breeches. The boy\u2019s clothes his host had dressed him in made him feel like ten pounds of sausage in a five-pound skin. If we eat this way every day I will be the size of Illyrio before I meet this dragon queen. Outside the litter night had fallen. Inside all was dark. Tyrion listened to Illyrio\u2019s snores, the creak of the leather straps, the slow clop clop of the team\u2019s ironshod hooves on the hard Valyrian road, but his heart was listening for the beat of leathern wings.\nWhen he woke, dawn had come. The horses plodded on, the litter creaking and swaying between them. Tyrion pulled the curtain back an inch to peer outside, but there was little to see but ochre fields, bare brown elms, and the road itself, a broad stone highway that ran straight as a spear to the horizon. He had read about Valyrian roads, but this was the first he had seen. The Freehold\u2019s grasp had reached as far as Dragonstone, but never to the mainland of Westeros itself. Odd, that. Dragonstone is no more than a rock. The wealth was farther west, but they had dragons. Surely they knew that it was there.\nHe had drunk too much last night. His head was pounding, and even the gentle swaying of the litter was enough to make his gorge rise in his throat. Though he said no word of complaint, his distress must have been plain to Illyrio Mopatis. \u201cCome, drink with me,\u201d the fat man said. \u201cA scale from the dragon that burned you, as they say.\u201d He poured for them from a flagon of blackberry wine so sweet that it drew more flies than honey. Tyrion shooed them off with the back of his hand and drank deep. The taste was so cloying that it was all he could do to keep it down. The second cup went down easier, however. Even so, he had no appetite, and when Illyrio offered him a bowl of blackberries in cream he waved it off. \u201cI dreamed about the queen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on my knees before her, swearing my allegiance, but she mistook me for my brother, Jaime, and fed me to her dragons.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope this dream was not prophetic. You are a clever imp, just as Varys said, and Daenerys will have need of clever men about her. Ser Barristan is a valiant knight and true; but none, I think, has ever called him cunning.\u201d\n\u201cKnights know only one way to solve a problem. They couch their lances and charge. A dwarf has a different way of looking at the world. What of you, though? You are a clever man yourself.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d Illyrio waggled his hand. \u201cAlas, I am not made for travel, so I will send you to Daenerys in my stead. You did Her Grace a great service when you slew your father, and it is my hope that you will do her many more. Daenerys is not the fool her brother was. She will make good use of you.\u201d\nAs kindling? Tyrion thought, smiling pleasantly.\nThey changed out teams only thrice that day but seemed to halt twice an hour at the least so Illyrio could climb down from the litter and have himself a piss. Our lord of cheese is the size of an elephant, but he has a bladder like a peanut, the dwarf mused. During one stop, he used the time to have a closer look at the road. Tyrion knew what he would find: not packed earth, nor bricks, nor cobbles, but a ribbon of fused stone raised a half foot above the ground to allow rainfall and snowmelt to run off its shoulders. Unlike the muddy tracks that passed for roads in the Seven Kingdoms, the Valyrian roads were wide enough for three wagons to pass abreast, and neither time nor traffic marred them. They still endured, unchanging, four centuries after Valyria itself had met its Doom. He looked for ruts and cracks but found only a pile of warm dung deposited by one of the horses.\nThe dung made him think of his lord father. Are you down in some hell, Father? A nice cold hell where you can look up and see me help restore Mad Aerys\u2019s daughter to the Iron Throne?\nAs they resumed their journey, Illyrio produced a bag of roasted chestnuts and began to speak once more of the dragon queen. \u201cOur last news of Queen Daenerys is old and stale, I fear. By now she will have left Meereen, we must assume. She has her host at last, a ragged host of sellswords, Dothraki horselords, and Unsullied infantry, and she will no doubt lead them west, to take back her father\u2019s throne.\u201d Magister Illyrio twisted open a pot of garlic snails, sniffed at them, and smiled. \u201cAt Volantis, you will have fresh tidings of Daenerys, we must hope,\u201d he said, as he sucked one from its shell. \u201cDragons and young girls are both capricious, and it may be that you will need to adjust your plans. Griff will know what to do. Will you have a snail? The garlic is from my own gardens.\u201d\nI could ride a snail and make a better pace than this litter of yours. Tyrion waved the dish away. \u201cYou place a deal of trust in this man Griff. Another friend of your childhood?\u201d\n\u201cNo. A sellsword, you would call him, but Westerosi born. Daenerys needs men worthy of her cause.\u201d Illyrio raised a hand. \u201cI know! \u2018Sellswords put gold before honor,\u2019 you are thinking. \u2018This man Griff will sell me to my sister.\u2019 Not so. I trust Griff as I would trust a brother.\u201d\nAnother mortal error. \u201cThen I shall do likewise.\u201d\n\u201cThe Golden Company marches toward Volantis as we speak, there to await the coming of our queen out of the east.\u201d\nBeneath the gold, the bitter steel. \u201cI had heard the Golden Company was under contract with one of the Free Cities.\u201d\n\u201cMyr.\u201d Illyrio smirked. \u201cContracts can be broken.\u201d\n\u201cThere is more coin in cheese than I knew,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cHow did you accomplish that?\u201d\nThe magister waggled his fat fingers. \u201cSome contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood. I say no more.\u201d\nThe dwarf pondered that. The Golden Company was reputedly the finest of the free companies, founded a century ago by Bittersteel, a bastard son of Aegon the Unworthy. When another of Aegon\u2019s Great Bastards tried to seize the Iron Throne from his trueborn half-brother, Bittersteel joined the revolt. Daemon Blackfyre had perished on the Redgrass Field, however, and his rebellion with him. Those followers of the Black Dragon who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across the narrow sea, among them Daemon\u2019s younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat. Some joined the Ragged Standard, some the Second Sons or Maiden\u2019s Men. Bittersteel saw the strength of House Blackfyre scattering to the four winds, so he formed the Golden Company to bind the exiles together.\nFrom that day to this, the men of the Golden Company had lived and died in the Disputed Lands, fighting for Myr or Lys or Tyrosh in their pointless little wars, and dreaming of the land their fathers had lost. They were exiles and sons of exiles, dispossessed and unforgiven\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet formidable fighters still.\n\u201cI admire your powers of persuasion,\u201d Tyrion told Illyrio. \u201cHow did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting against the Targaryens?\u201d\nIllyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. \u201cBlack or red, a dragon is still a dragon. When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House Blackfyre.\u201d The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard. \u201cAnd Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could. She will take them home.\u201d\nWith fire and sword. It was the kind of homecoming that Tyrion wished for as well. \u201cTen thousand swords makes for a princely gift, I grant you. Her Grace should be most pleased.\u201d\nThe magister gave a modest bob of his head, chins jiggling. \u201cI would never presume to say what might please Her Grace.\u201d\nPrudent of you. Tyrion knew much and more about the gratitude of kings. Why should queens be any different?\nSoon enough the magister was fast asleep, leaving Tyrion to brood alone. He wondered what Barristan Selmy would think of riding into battle with the Golden Company. During the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Selmy had cut a bloody path through their ranks to slay the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders. Rebellion makes for queer bedfellows. And none more queer than this fat man and me.\nThe cheesemonger woke when they stopped to change the horses and sent for a fresh hamper. \u201cHow far have we come?\u201d the dwarf asked him as they stuffed themselves with cold capon and a relish made of carrots, raisins, and bits of lime and orange.\n\u201cThis is Andalos, my friend. The land your Andals came from. They took it from the hairy men who were here before them, cousins to the hairy men of Ib. The heart of Hugor\u2019s ancient realm lies north of us, but we are passing through its southern marches. In Pentos, these are called the Flatlands. Farther east stand the Velvet Hills, whence we are bound.\u201d\nAndalos. The Faith taught that the Seven themselves had once walked the hills of Andalos in human form. \u201cThe Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars,\u201d Tyrion recited from memory, \u201cand one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing crown.\u201d\nMagister Illyrio gave him a curious look. \u201cI did not dream my little friend was so devout.\u201d\nThe dwarf shrugged. \u201cA relic of my boyhood. I knew I would not make a knight, so I decided to be High Septon. That crystal crown adds a foot to a man\u2019s height. I studied the holy books and prayed until I had scabs on both my knees, but my quest came to a tragic end. I reached that certain age and fell in love.\u201d\n\u201cA maiden? I know the way of that.\u201d Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver locket. Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked by silver. \u201cSerra. I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the end I wed her. Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of Pentos. The palace gates were closed to me thereafter, but I did not care. The price was small enough, for Serra.\u201d\n\u201cHow did she die?\u201d Tyrion knew that she was dead; no man spoke so fondly of a woman who had abandoned him.\n\u201cA Braavosi trading galley called at Pentos on her way back from the Jade Sea. The Treasure carried cloves and saffron, jet and jade, scarlet samite, green silk\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the grey death. We slew her oarsmen as they came ashore and burned the ship at anchor, but the rats crept down the oars and paddled to the quay on cold stone feet. The plague took two thousand before it ran its course.\u201d Magister Illyrio closed the locket. \u201cI keep her hands in my bedchamber. Her hands that were so soft\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nTyrion thought of Tysha. He glanced out at the fields where once the gods had walked. \u201cWhat sort of gods make rats and plagues and dwarfs?\u201d Another passage from The Seven-Pointed Star came back to him. \u201cThe Maid brought him forth a girl as supple as a willow with eyes like deep blue pools, and Hugor declared that he would have her for his bride. So the Mother made her fertile, and the Crone foretold that she would bear the king four-and-forty mighty sons. The Warrior gave strength to their arms, whilst the Smith wrought for each a suit of iron plates.\u201d\n\u201cYour Smith must have been Rhoynish,\u201d Illyrio quipped. \u201cThe Andals learned the art of working iron from the Rhoynar who dwelt along the river. This is known.\u201d\n\u201cNot by our septons.\u201d Tyrion gestured at the fields. \u201cWho dwells in these Flatlands of yours?\u201d\n\u201cTillers and toilers, bound to the land. There are orchards, farms, mines\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I own some such myself, though I seldom visit them. Why should I spend my days out here, with the myriad delights of Pentos close at hand?\u201d\n\u201cMyriad delights.\u201d And huge thick walls. Tyrion swirled his wine in his cup. \u201cWe have seen no towns since Pentos.\u201d\n\u201cThere are ruins.\u201d Illyrio waved a chicken leg toward the curtains. \u201cThe horselords come this way, whenever some khal takes it into his head to gaze upon the sea. The Dothraki are not fond of towns, you will know this even in Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cFall upon one of these khalasars and destroy it, and you may find that the Dothraki are not so quick to cross the Rhoyne.\u201d\n\u201cIt is cheaper to buy off foes with food and gifts.\u201d\nIf only I had thought to bring a nice cheese to the battle on the Blackwater, I might still have all my nose. Lord Tywin had always held the Free Cities in contempt. They fight with coins instead of swords, he used to say. Gold has its uses, but wars are won with iron. \u201cGive gold to a foe and he will just come back for more, my father always said.\u201d\n\u201cIs this the selfsame father that you murdered?\u201d Illyrio tossed his chicken bone from the litter. \u201cSellswords will not stand against Dothraki screamers. That was proved at Qohor.\u201d\n\u201cNot even your brave Griff?\u201d mocked Tyrion.\n\u201cGriff is different. He has a son he dotes on. Young Griff, the boy is called. There never was a nobler lad.\u201d\nThe wine, the food, the sun, the sway of the litter, the buzzing of the flies, all conspired to make Tyrion sleepy. So he slept, woke, drank. Illyrio matched him cup for cup. And as the sky turned a dusky purple, the fat man began to snore.\nThat night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as red as blood. He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them. In the dream he had two heads, both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again. Then he killed his brother, Jaime, hacking at his face until it was a red ruin, laughing every time he struck a blow. Only when the fight was finished did he realize that his second head was weeping.\nWhen he woke his stunted legs were stiff as iron. Illyrio was eating olives. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Tyrion asked him.\n\u201cWe have not yet left the Flatlands, my hasty friend. Soon our road shall pass into the Velvet Hills. There we begin our climb toward Ghoyan Drohe, upon the Little Rhoyne.\u201d\nGhoyan Drohe had been a Rhoynar city, until the dragons of Valyria had reduced it to a smoldering desolation. I am traveling through years as well as leagues, Tyrion reflected, back through history to the days when dragons ruled the earth.\nTyrion slept and woke and slept again, and day and night seemed not to matter. The Velvet Hills proved a disappointment. \u201cHalf the whores in Lannisport have breasts bigger than these hills,\u201d he told Illyrio. \u201cYou ought to call them the Velvet Teats.\u201d They saw a circle of standing stones that Illyrio claimed had been raised by giants, and later a deep lake. \u201cHere lived a den of robbers who preyed on all who passed this way,\u201d Illyrio said. \u201cIt is said they still dwell beneath the water. Those who fish the lake are pulled under and devoured.\u201d The next evening they came upon a huge Valyrian sphinx crouched beside the road. It had a dragon\u2019s body and a woman\u2019s face.\n\u201cA dragon queen,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cA pleasant omen.\u201d\n\u201cHer king is missing.\u201d Illyrio pointed out the smooth stone plinth on which the second sphinx once stood, now grown over with moss and flowering vines. \u201cThe horselords built wooden wheels beneath him and dragged him back to Vaes Dothrak.\u201d\nThat is an omen too, thought Tyrion, but not as hopeful.\nThat night, drunker than usual, he broke into sudden song.",

As the strength went out of her, her blows became moths fluttering about his face. Each time he gave the chain another twist the golden hands dug deeper.

      "content": "THE MERCHANT\u2019S MAN\nAdventure stank.\nShe boasted sixty oars, a single sail, and a long lean hull that promised speed. Small, but she might serve, Quentyn thought when he saw her, but that was before he went aboard and got a good whiff of her. Pigs, was his first thought, but after a second sniff he changed his mind. Pigs had a cleaner smell. This stink was piss and rotting meat and nightsoil, this was the reek of corpse flesh and weeping sores and wounds gone bad, so strong that it overwhelmed the salt air and fish smell of the harbor.\n\u201cI want to retch,\u201d he said to Gerris Drinkwater. They were waiting for the ship\u2019s master to appear, sweltering in the heat as the stench wafted up from the deck beneath them.\n\u201cIf the captain smells anything like his ship, he may mistake your vomit for perfume,\u201d Gerris replied.\nQuentyn was about to suggest that they try another ship when the master finally made his appearance, with two vile-looking crewmen at his side. Gerris greeted him with a smile. Though he did not speak the Volantene tongue as well as Quentyn, their ruse required that he speak for them. Back in the Planky Town Quentyn had played the wineseller, but the mummery had chafed at him, so when the Dornishmen changed ships at Lys they had changed roles as well. Aboard the Meadowlark, Cletus Yronwood became the merchant, Quentyn the servant; in Volantis, with Cletus slain, Gerris had assumed the master\u2019s role.\nTall and fair, with blue-green eyes, sandy hair streaked by the sun, and a lean and comely body, Gerris Drinkwater had a swagger to him, a confidence bordering on arrogance. He never seemed ill at ease, and even when he did not speak the language, he had ways of making himself understood. Quentyn cut a poor figure by comparison\u2014short-legged and stocky, thickly built, with hair the brown of new-turned earth. His forehead was too high, his jaw too square, his nose too broad. A good honest face, a girl had called it once, but you should smile more.\nSmiles had never come easily for Quentyn Martell, any more than they did for his lord father.\n\u201cHow swift is your Adventure?\u201d Gerris said, in a halting approximation of High Valyrian.\nThe Adventure\u2019s master recognized the accent and responded in the Common Tongue of Westeros. \u201cThere is none swifter, honored lord. Adventure can run down the wind itself. Tell me where you wish to sail, and swiftly I shall bring you there.\u201d\n\u201cI seek passage to Meereen for myself and two servants.\u201d\nThat gave the captain pause. \u201cI am no stranger to Meereen. I could find the city again, aye\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but why? There are no slaves to be had in Meereen, no profit to be found there. The silver queen has put an end to that. She has even closed the fighting pits, so a poor sailor cannot even amuse himself as he waits to fill his holds. Tell me, my Westerosi friend, what is there in Meereen that you should want to go there?\u201d\nThe most beautiful woman in the world, thought Quentyn. My bride-to-be, if the gods are good. Sometimes at night he lay awake imagining her face and form, and wondering why such a woman would ever want to marry him, of all the princes in the world. I am Dorne, he told himself. She will want Dorne.\nGerris answered with the tale they had concocted. \u201cWine is our family trade. My father owns extensive vineyards back in Dorne, and wishes me to find new markets. It is hoped that the good folk of Meereen will welcome what I sell.\u201d\n\u201cWine? Dornish wine?\u201d The captain was not convinced. \u201cThe slave cities are at war. Can it be you do not know this?\u201d\n\u201cThe fighting is between Yunkai and Astapor, we had heard. Meereen is not involved.\u201d\n\u201cNot as yet. But soon. An envoy from the Yellow City is in Volantis even now, hiring swords. The Long Lances have already taken ship for Yunkai, and the Windblown and the Company of the Cat will follow once they have finished filling out their ranks. The Golden Company marches east as well. All this is known.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so. I deal in wine, not wars. Ghiscari wine is poor stuff, all agree. The Meereenese will pay a good price for my fine Dornish vintages.\u201d\n\u201cDead men do not care what kind of wine they drink.\u201d The master of Adventure fingered his beard. \u201cI am not the first captain you have approached, I think. Nor the tenth.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gerris admitted.\n\u201cHow many, then? A hundred?\u201d\nClose enough, thought Quentyn. The Volantenes were fond of boasting that the hundred isles of Braavos could be dropped into their deep harbor and drowned. Quentyn had never seen Braavos, but he could believe it. Rich and ripe and rotted, Volantis covered the mouth of the Rhoyne like a warm wet kiss, stretching across hill and marsh on both sides of the river. Ships were everywhere, coming down the river or headed out to sea, crowding the wharves and piers, taking on cargo or off-loading it: warships and whalers and trading galleys, carracks and skiffs, cogs, great cogs, longships, swan ships, ships from Lys and Tyrosh and Pentos, Qartheen spicers big as palaces, ships from Tolos and Yunkai and the Basilisks. So many that Quentyn, seeing the port for the first time from the deck of the Meadowlark, had told his friends that they would only linger here three days.\nYet twenty days had passed, and here they remained, still shipless. The captains of the Melantine, the Triarch\u2019s Daughter, and the Mermaid\u2019s Kiss had all refused them. A mate on the Bold Voyager had laughed in their faces. The master of the Dolphin berated them for wasting his time, and the owner of the Seventh Son accused them of being pirates. All on the first day.\nOnly the captain of the Fawn had given them reasons for his refusal. \u201cIt is true that I am sailing east,\u201d he told them, over watered wine. \u201cSouth around Valyria and thence into the sunrise. We will take on water and provisions at New Ghis, then bend all oars toward Qarth and the Jade Gates. Every voyage has perils, long ones more than most. Why should I seek out more danger by turning into Slaver\u2019s Bay? The Fawn is my livelihood. I will not risk her to take three mad Dornishmen into the middle of a war.\u201d\nQuentyn had begun to think that they might have done better to buy their own ship in the Planky Town. That would have drawn unwanted attention, however. The Spider had informers everywhere, even in the halls of Sunspear. \u201cDorne will bleed if your purpose is discovered,\u201d his father had warned him, as they watched the children frolic in the pools and fountains of the Water Gardens. \u201cWhat we do is treason, make no mistake. Trust only your companions, and do your best to avoid attracting notice.\u201d\nSo Gerris Drinkwater gave the captain of Adventure his most disarming smile. \u201cTruth be told, I have not kept count of all the cowards who refused us, but at the Merchant\u2019s House I heard it said that you were a bolder sort of man, the sort who might risk anything for sufficient gold.\u201d\nA smuggler, Quentyn thought. That was how the other traders styled Adventure\u2019s master, back at the Merchant\u2019s House. \u201cHe is a smuggler and a slaver, half pirate and half pander, but it may be that he is your best hope,\u201d the innkeep had told them.\nThe captain rubbed thumb and forefinger together. \u201cAnd how much gold would you deem sufficient for such a voyage?\u201d\n\u201cThrice your usual fee for passage to Slaver\u2019s Bay.\u201d\n\u201cFor each of you?\u201d The captain showed his teeth in something that might have been intended as a smile though it gave his narrow face a feral look. \u201cPerhaps. It is true, I am a bolder man than most. How soon will you wish to leave?\u201d\n\u201cThe morrow would not be too soon.\u201d\n\u201cDone. Return an hour before first light, with your friends and your wines. Best to be under way whilst Volantis sleeps, so no one will ask us inconvenient questions about our destination.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. An hour before first light.\u201d\nThe captain\u2019s smile widened. \u201cI am pleased that I can help you. We will have a happy voyage, yes?\u201d\n\u201cI am certain of it,\u201d said Gerris. The captain called for ale then, and the two of them drank a toast to their venture.\n\u201cA sweet man,\u201d Gerris said afterward, as he and Quentyn made their way down to the foot of the pier where their hired hathay waited. The air hung hot and heavy, and the sun was so bright that both of them were squinting.\n\u201cThis is a sweet city,\u201d Quentyn agreed. Sweet enough to rot your teeth. Sweet beets were grown in profusion hereabouts, and were served with almost every meal. The Volantenes made a cold soup of them, as thick and rich as purple honey. Their wines were sweet as well. \u201cI fear our happy voyage will be short, however. That sweet man does not mean to take us to Meereen. He was too quick to accept your offer. He\u2019ll take thrice the usual fee, no doubt, and once he has us aboard and out of sight of land, he\u2019ll slit our throats and take the rest of our gold as well.\u201d\n\u201cOr chain us to an oar, beside those wretches we were smelling. We need to find a better class of smuggler, I think.\u201d\nTheir driver awaited them beside his hathay. In Westeros, it might have been called an oxcart, though it was a deal more ornate than any cart that Quentyn had ever seen in Dorne, and lacked an ox. The hathay was pulled by a dwarf elephant, her hide the color of dirty snow. The streets of Old Volantis were full of such.\nQuentyn would have preferred to walk, but they were miles from their inn. Besides, the innkeep at the Merchant\u2019s House had warned him that traveling afoot would taint them in the eyes of foreign captains and the native-born Volantenes alike. Persons of quality traveled by palanquin, or in the back of a hathay\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and as it happened the innkeep had a cousin who owned several such contrivances and would be pleased to serve them in this matter.\nTheir driver was one of the cousin\u2019s slaves, a small man with a wheel tattooed upon one cheek, naked but for a breechclout and a pair of sandals. His skin was the color of teak, his eyes chips of flint. After he had helped them up onto the cushioned bench between the cart\u2019s two huge wooden wheels, he clambered onto the elephant\u2019s back. \u201cThe Merchant\u2019s House,\u201d Quentyn told him, \u201cbut go along the wharves.\u201d Beyond the waterfront and its breezes, the streets and alleys of Volantis were hot enough to drown a man in his own sweat, at least on this side of the river.\nThe driver shouted something at his elephant in the local tongue. The beast began to move, trunk swaying from side to side. The cart lurched along behind her, the driver hooting at sailors and slaves alike to clear the way. It was easy enough to tell one from the other. The slaves were all tattooed: a mask of blue feathers, a lightning bolt that ran from jaw to brow, a coin upon the cheek, a leopard\u2019s spots, a skull, a jug. Maester Kedry said there were five slaves for every free man in Volantis though he had not lived long enough to verify his estimate. He had perished on the morning the corsairs swarmed aboard the Meadowlark.\nQuentyn lost two other friends that same day\u2014Willam Wells with his freckles and his crooked teeth, fearless with a lance, and Cletus Yronwood, handsome despite his lazy eye, always randy, always laughing. Cletus had been Quentyn\u2019s dearest friend for half his life, a brother in all but blood. \u201cGive your bride a kiss for me,\u201d Cletus had whispered to him, just before he died.\nThe corsairs had come aboard in the darkness before the dawn, as the Meadowlark was anchored off the coast of the Disputed Lands. The crew had beaten them off, at the cost of twelve lives. Afterward the sailors stripped the dead corsairs of boots and belts and weapons, divvied up their purses, and yanked gemstones from their ears and rings from their fingers. One of the corpses was so fat that the ship\u2019s cook had to cut his fingers off with a meat cleaver to claim his rings. It took three Meadowlarks to roll the body into the sea. The other pirates were chucked in after him, without a word of prayer or ceremony.\nTheir own dead received more tender treatment. The sailors sewed their bodies up in canvas, weighed down with ballast stones so they might sink more quickly. The captain of the Meadowlark led his crew in a prayer for the souls of their slain shipmates. Then he turned to his Dornish passengers, the three who still remained of the six who had come aboard at the Planky Town. Even the big man had emerged, pale and greensick and unsteady on his feet, struggling up from the depths of the ship\u2019s hold to pay his last respects. \u201cOne of you should say some words for your dead, before we give them to the sea,\u201d the captain said. Gerris had obliged, lying with every other word, since he dare not tell the truth of who they\u2019d been or why they\u2019d come.\nIt was not supposed to end like that for them. \u201cThis will be a tale to tell our grandchildren,\u201d Cletus had declared the day they set out from his father\u2019s castle. Will made a face at that, and said, \u201cA tale to tell tavern wenches, you mean, in hopes they\u2019ll lift their skirts.\u201d Cletus had slapped him on the back. \u201cFor grandchildren, you need children. For children, you need to lift some skirts.\u201d Later, in the Planky Town, the Dornishmen had toasted Quentyn\u2019s future bride, made ribald japes about his wedding night to come, and talked about the things they\u2019d see, the deeds they\u2019d do, the glory they would win. All they won was a sailcloth sack filled with ballast stones.\nAs much as he mourned Will and Cletus, it was the maester\u2019s loss that Quentyn felt most keenly. Kedry had been fluent in the tongues of all of the Free Cities, and even the mongrel Ghiscari that men spoke along the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay. \u201cMaester Kedry will accompany you,\u201d his father said the night they parted. \u201cHeed his counsel. He has devoted half his life to the study of the Nine Free Cities.\u201d Quentyn wondered if things might not have gone a deal easier if only he were here to guide them.\n\u201cI would sell my mother for a bit of breeze,\u201d said Gerris, as they rolled through the dockside throngs. \u201cIt\u2019s moist as the Maiden\u2019s cunt, and still shy of noon. I hate this city.\u201d\nQuentyn shared the feeling. The sullen wet heat of Volantis sapped his strength and left him feeling dirty. The worst part was knowing that nightfall would bring no relief. Up in the high meadows north of Lord Yronwood\u2019s estates, the air was always crisp and cool after dark, no matter how hot the day had been. Not here. In Volantis, the nights were almost as hot as the days.\n\u201cThe Goddess sails for New Ghis on the morrow,\u201d Gerris reminded him. \u201cThat at least would bring us closer.\u201d\n\u201cNew Ghis is an island, and a much smaller port than this. We would be closer, yes, but we could find ourselves stranded. And New Ghis has allied with the Yunkai\u2019i.\u201d That news had not come as a surprise to Quentyn. New Ghis and Yunkai were both Ghiscari cities. \u201cIf Volantis should ally with them as well\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe need to find a ship from Westeros,\u201d suggested Gerris, \u201csome trader out of Lannisport or Oldtown.\u201d\n\u201cFew come this far, and those who do fill their holds with silk and spice from the Jade Sea, then bend their oars for home.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a Braavosi ship? One hears of purple sails as far away as Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea.\u201d\n\u201cThe Braavosi are descended from escaped slaves. They do not trade in Slaver\u2019s Bay.\u201d\n\u201cDo we have enough gold to buy a ship?\u201d\n\u201cAnd who will sail her? You? Me?\u201d Dornishmen had never been seafarers, not since Nymeria burned her ten thousand ships. \u201cThe seas around Valyria are perilous, and thick with corsairs.\u201d\n\u201cI have had enough of corsairs. Let\u2019s not buy a ship.\u201d\nThis is still just a game to him, Quentyn realized, no different than the time he led six of us up into the mountains to find the old lair of the Vulture King. It was not in Gerris Drinkwater\u2019s nature to imagine they might fail, let alone that they might die. Even the deaths of three friends had not served to chasten him, it would seem. He leaves that to me. He knows my nature is as cautious as his is bold.\n\u201cPerhaps the big man is right,\u201d Ser Gerris said. \u201cPiss on the sea, we can finish the journey overland.\u201d\n\u201cYou know why he says that,\u201d Quentyn said. \u201cHe\u2019d rather die than set foot on another ship.\u201d The big man had been greensick every day of their voyage. In Lys, it had taken him four days to recover his strength. They\u2019d had to take rooms in an inn so Maester Kedry could tuck him into a feather bed and feed him broths and potions until some pink returned to his cheeks.\nIt was possible to go overland to Meereen, that much was true. The old Valyrian roads would take them there. Dragon roads, men called the great stone roadways of the Freehold, but the one that ran eastward from Volantis to Meereen had earned a more sinister name: the demon road.\n\u201cThe demon road is dangerous, and too slow,\u201d Quentyn said. \u201cTywin Lannister will send his own men after the queen once word of her reaches King\u2019s Landing.\u201d His father had been certain of that. \u201cHis will come with knives. If they reach her first\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope her dragons will sniff them out and eat them,\u201d said Gerris. \u201cWell, if we cannot find a ship, and you will not let us ride, we had as well book passage back to Dorne.\u201d\nCrawl back to Sunspear defeated, with my tail between my legs? His father\u2019s disappointment would be more than Quentyn could bear, and the scorn of the Sand Snakes would be withering. Doran Martell had put the fate of Dorne into his hands, he could not fail him, not whilst life remained.\nHeat shimmers rose off the street as the hathay rattled and jounced along on its iron-rimmed wheels, giving a dreamlike quality to their surroundings. In amongst the warehouses and the wharves, shops and stalls of many sorts crowded the waterfront. Here fresh oysters could be bought, here iron chains and manacles, here cyvasse pieces carved of ivory and jade. Here were temples too, where sailors came to sacrifice to foreign gods, cheek by jowl with pillow houses where women called down from balconies to men below. \u201cHave a look at that one,\u201d Gerris urged, as they passed one pillow house. \u201cI think she\u2019s in love with you.\u201d\nAnd how much does a whore\u2019s love cost? Truth be told, girls made Quentyn anxious, especially the pretty ones.\nWhen first he\u2019d come to Yronwood, he had been smitten with Ynys, the eldest of Lord Yronwood\u2019s daughters. Though he never said a word about his feelings, he nursed his dreams for years\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until the day she was dispatched to wed Ser Ryon Allyrion, the heir to Godsgrace. The last time he had seen her, she\u2019d had one boy at her breast and another clinging to her skirts.\nAfter Ynys had come the Drinkwater twins, a pair of tawny young maidens who loved hawking, hunting, climbing rocks, and making Quentyn blush. One of them had given him his first kiss, though he never knew which one. As daughters of a landed knight, the twins were too lowborn to marry, but Cletus did not think that was any reason to stop kissing them. \u201cAfter you\u2019re wed you can take one of them for a paramour. Or both, why not?\u201d But Quentyn thought of several reasons why not, so he had done his best to avoid the twins thereafter, and there had been no second kiss.\nMore recently, the youngest of Lord Yronwood\u2019s daughters had taken to following him about the castle. Gwyneth was but twelve, a small, scrawny girl whose dark eyes and brown hair set her apart in that house of blue-eyed blondes. She was clever, though, as quick with words as with her hands, and fond of telling Quentyn that he had to wait for her to flower, so she could marry him.\nThat was before Prince Doran had summoned him to the Water Gardens. And now the most beautiful woman in the world was waiting in Meereen, and he meant to do his duty and claim her for his bride. She will not refuse me. She will honor the agreement. Daenerys Targaryen would need Dorne to win the Seven Kingdoms, and that meant that she would need him. It does not mean that she will love me, though. She may not even like me.\nThe street curved where the river met the sea, and there along the bend a number of animal sellers were clustered together, offering jeweled lizards, giant banded snakes, and agile little monkeys with striped tails and clever pink hands. \u201cPerhaps your silver queen would like a monkey,\u201d said Gerris.\nQuentyn had no idea what Daenerys Targaryen might like. He had promised his father that he would bring her back to Dorne, but more and more he wondered if he was equal to the task.\nI never asked for this, he thought.\nAcross the wide blue expanse of the Rhoyne, he could see the Black Wall that had been raised by the Valyrians when Volantis was no more than an outpost of their empire: a great oval of fused stone two hundred feet high and so thick that six four-horse chariots could race around its top abreast, as they did each year to celebrate the founding of the city. Outlanders, foreigners, and freedmen were not allowed inside the Black Wall save at the invitation of those who dwelt within, scions of the Old Blood who could trace their ancestry back to Valyria itself.\nThe traffic was thicker here. They were near the western end of the Long Bridge, which linked the two halves of the city. Wayns and carts and hathays crowded the streets, all of them coming from the bridge or making for it. Slaves were everywhere, as numerous as roaches, scurrying about their masters\u2019 business.\nNot far from Fishermonger\u2019s Square and the Merchant\u2019s House, shouts erupted from a cross street, and a dozen Unsullied spearmen in ornate armor and tiger-skin cloaks appeared as if from nowhere, waving everyone aside so the triarch could pass through atop his elephant. The triarch\u2019s elephant was a grey-skinned behemoth clad in elaborate enameled armor that clattered softly as he moved, the castle on its back so tall that it scraped the top of the ornamental stone arch he was passing underneath. \u201cThe triarchs are considered so elevated that their feet are not allowed to touch the ground during their year of service,\u201d Quentyn informed his companion. \u201cThey ride everywhere on elephants.\u201d\n\u201cBlocking up the streets and leaving heaps of dung for the likes of us to contend with,\u201d said Gerris. \u201cWhy Volantis needs three princes when Dorne makes do with one, I will never know.\u201d\n\u201cThe triarchs are neither kings nor princes. Volantis is a freehold, like Valyria of old. All freeborn landholders share the rule. Even women are allowed to vote, provided they own land. The three triarchs are chosen from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria, to serve until the first day of the new year. And you would know all this if you had troubled to read the book that Maester Kedry gave you.\u201d\n\u201cIt had no pictures.\u201d\n\u201cThere were maps.\u201d\n\u201cMaps do not count. If he had told me it was about tigers and elephants, I might have given it a try. It looked suspiciously like a history.\u201d\nWhen their hathay reached the edge of the Fishermonger\u2019s Square, their elephant lifted her trunk and made a honking noise like some huge white goose, reluctant to plunge into the tangle of wayns, palanquins, and foot traffic ahead. Their driver prodded her with his heel and kept her moving.\nThe fishmongers were out in strength, crying the morning catch. Quentyn understood one word in two at best, but he did not need to know the words to know the fish. He saw cod and sailfish and sardines, barrels of mussels and clams. Eels hung along the front of one stall. Another displayed a gigantic turtle, strung up by its legs on iron chains, heavy as a horse. Crabs scrabbled inside casks of brine and seaweed. Several of the vendors were frying chunks of fish with onions and beets, or selling peppery fish stew out of small iron kettles.\nIn the center of the square, under the cracked and headless statue of a dead triarch, a crowd had begun to gather about some dwarfs putting on a show. The little men were done up in wooden armor, miniature knights preparing for a joust. Quentyn saw one mount a dog, as the other hopped onto a pig\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only to slide right off again, to a smattering of laughter.\n\u201cThey look amusing,\u201d Gerris said. \u201cShall we stop and watch them fight? A laugh might serve you well, Quent. You look like an old man who has not moved his bowels in half a year.\u201d\nI am eight-and-ten, six years younger than you, Quentyn thought. I am no old man. Instead he said, \u201cI have no need for comic dwarfs. Unless they have a ship.\u201d\n\u201cA small one, I would think.\u201d\nFour stories tall, the Merchant\u2019s House dominated the docks and wharves and storehouses that surrounded it. Here traders from Oldtown and King\u2019s Landing mingled with their counterparts from Braavos and Pentos and Myr, with hairy Ibbenese, pale-skinned voyagers from Qarth, coal-black Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks, even masked shadow-binders from Asshai by the Shadow.\nThe paving stones felt warm beneath his feet when Quentyn climbed down from the hathay, even through the leather of his boots. Outside the Merchant\u2019s House a trestle table had been set up in the shade and decorated with striped blue-and-white pennons that fluttered at every breath of air. Four hard-eyed sellswords lounged around the table, calling out to every passing man and boy. Windblown, Quentyn knew. The serjeants were looking for fresh meat to fill their ranks before they sailed for Slaver\u2019s Bay. And every man who signs with them is another sword for Yunkai, another blade meant to drink the blood of my bride-to-be.\nOne of the Windblown shouted at them. \u201cI do not speak your tongue,\u201d Quentyn answered. Though he could read and write High Valyrian, he had little practice speaking it. And the Volantene apple had rolled a fair distance from the Valyrian tree.\n\u201cWesterosi?\u201d the man answered, in the Common Tongue.\n\u201cDornishmen. My master is a wineseller.\u201d\n\u201cMaster? Fuck that. Are you a slave? Come with us and be your own master. Do you want to die abed? We\u2019ll teach you sword and spear. You\u2019ll ride to battle with the Tattered Prince and come home richer than a lord. Boys, girls, gold, whatever you want, if you\u2019re man enough to take it. We\u2019re the Windblown, and we fuck the goddess slaughter up her arse.\u201d\nTwo of the sellswords began to sing, bellowing out the words to some marching song. Quentyn understood enough to get the gist. We are the Windblown, they sang. Blow us east to Slaver\u2019s Bay, we\u2019ll kill the butcher king and fuck the dragon queen.\n\u201cIf Cletus and Will were still with us, we could come back with the big man and kill the lot of them,\u201d said Gerris.\nCletus and Will are dead. \u201cPay them no mind,\u201d Quentyn said. The sellswords threw taunts at their backs as they pushed through the doors of the Merchant\u2019s House, mocking them as bloodless cravens and frightened girls.\nThe big man was waiting in their rooms on the second floor. Though the inn had come well recommended by the master of the Meadowlark, that did not mean Quentyn was willing to leave their goods and gold unguarded. Every port had thieves, rats, and whores, and Volantis had more than most.\n\u201cI was about to go out looking for you,\u201d Ser Archibald Yronwood said as he slid the bar back to admit them. It was his cousin Cletus who had started calling him the big man, but the name was well deserved. Arch was six-and-a-half-feet tall, broad of shoulder, huge of belly, with legs like tree trunks, hands the size of hams, and no neck to speak of. Some childhood malady had made all his hair fall out. His bald head reminded Quentyn of a smooth pink boulder. \u201cSo,\u201d he demanded, \u201cwhat did the smuggler say? Do we have a boat?\u201d\n\u201cA ship,\u201d corrected Quentyn. \u201cAye, he\u2019ll take us, but only as far as the nearest hell.\u201d\nGerris sat upon a sagging bed and pulled off his boots. \u201cDorne is sounding more attractive every moment.\u201d\nThe big man said, \u201cI still say we would do better to ride the demon road. Might be it\u2019s not as perilous as men say. And if it is, that only means more glory for those who dare it. Who would dare molest us? Drink with his sword, me with my hammer, that\u2019s more than any demon could digest.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if Daenerys is dead before we reach her?\u201d Quentyn said. \u201cWe must have a ship. Even if it is Adventure.\u201d\nGerris laughed. \u201cYou must be more desperate for Daenerys than I knew if you\u2019d endure that stench for months on end. After three days, I\u2019d be begging them to murder me. No, my prince, I pray you, not Adventure.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a better way?\u201d Quentyn asked him.\n\u201cI do. It\u2019s just now come to me. It has its risks, and it is not what you would call honorable, I grant you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but it will get you to your queen quicker than the demon road.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said Quentyn Martell.",

      "content": "JON\nJon Snow read the letter over until the words began to blur and run together. I cannot sign this. I will not sign this.\nHe almost burned the parchment then and there. Instead he took a sip of ale, the dregs of the half cup that remained from his solitary supper the night before. I have to sign it. They chose me to be their lord commander. The Wall is mine, and the Watch as well. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part.\nIt was a relief when Dolorous Edd Tollett opened the door to tell him that Gilly was without. Jon set Maester Aemon\u2019s letter aside. \u201cI will see her.\u201d He dreaded this. \u201cFind Sam for me. I will want to speak with him next.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be down with the books. My old septon used to say that books are dead men talking. Dead men should keep quiet, is what I say. No one wants to hear a dead man\u2019s yabber.\u201d Dolorous Edd went off muttering of worms and spiders.\nWhen Gilly entered, she went at once to her knees. Jon came around the table and drew her to her feet. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take a knee for me. That\u2019s just for kings.\u201d Though a wife and mother, Gilly still seemed half a child to him, a slender little thing wrapped up in one of Sam\u2019s old cloaks. The cloak was so big on her that she could have hidden several other girls beneath its folds. \u201cThe babes are well?\u201d he asked her.\nThe wildling girl smiled timidly from under her cowl. \u201cYes, m\u2019lord. I was scared I wouldn\u2019t have milk enough for both, but the more they suck, the more I have. They\u2019re strong.\u201d\n\u201cI have something hard to tell you.\u201d He almost said ask, but caught himself at the last instant.\n\u201cIs it Mance? Val begged the king to spare him. She said she\u2019d let some kneeler marry her and never slit his throat if only Mance could live. That Lord o\u2019Bones, he\u2019s to be spared. Craster always swore he\u2019d kill him if he ever showed his face about the keep. Mance never did half the things he done.\u201d\nAll Mance ever did was lead an army down upon the realm he once swore to protect. \u201cMance said our words, Gilly. Then he turned his cloak, wed Dalla, and crowned himself King-Beyond-the-Wall. His life is in the king\u2019s hands now. It\u2019s not him we need to talk about. It\u2019s his son. Dalla\u2019s boy.\u201d\n\u201cThe babe?\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cHe never broke no oath, m\u2019lord. He sleeps and cries and sucks, is all; he\u2019s never done no harm to no one. Don\u2019t let her burn him. Save him, please.\u201d\n\u201cOnly you can do that, Gilly.\u201d Jon told her how.\nAnother woman would have shrieked at him, cursed him, damned him down to seven hells. Another woman might have flown at him in rage, slapped him, kicked him, raked at his eyes with her nails. Another woman might have thrown her defiance in his teeth.\nGilly shook her head. \u201cNo. Please, no.\u201d\nThe raven picked up the word. \u201cNo,\u201d it screamed.\n\u201cRefuse, and the boy will burn. Not on the morrow, nor the day after\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but soon, whenever Melisandre needs to wake a dragon or raise a wind or work some other spell requiring king\u2019s blood. Mance will be ash and bone by then, so she will claim his son for the fire, and Stannis will not deny her. If you do not take the boy away, she will burn him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said Gilly. \u201cI\u2019ll take him, I\u2019ll take the both o\u2019 them, Dalla\u2019s boy and mine.\u201d Tears rolled down her cheeks. If not for the way the candle made them glisten, Jon might never have known that she was weeping. Craster\u2019s wives would have taught their daughters to shed their tears into a pillow. Perhaps they went outside to weep, well away from Craster\u2019s fists.\nJon closed the fingers of his sword hand. \u201cTake both boys and the queen\u2019s men will ride after you and drag you back. The boy will still burn\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and you with him.\u201d If I comfort her, she may think that tears can move me. She has to realize that I will not yield. \u201cYou\u2019ll take one boy, and that one Dalla\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cA mother can\u2019t leave her son, or else she\u2019s cursed forever. Not a son. We saved him, Sam and me. Please. Please, m\u2019lord. We saved him from the cold.\u201d\n\u201cMen say that freezing to death is almost peaceful. Fire, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0do you see the candle, Gilly?\u201d\nShe looked at the flame. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cTouch it. Put your hand over the flame.\u201d\nHer big brown eyes grew bigger still. She did not move.\n\u201cDo it.\u201d Kill the boy. \u201cNow.\u201d\nTrembling, the girl reached out her hand, held it well above the flickering candle flame.\n\u201cDown. Let it kiss you.\u201d\nGilly lowered her hand. An inch. Another. When the flame licked her flesh, she snatched her hand back and began to sob.\n\u201cFire is a cruel way to die. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll burn my babe, then. The red woman. If she can\u2019t have Dalla\u2019s, she\u2019ll burn mine.\u201d\n\u201cYour son has no king\u2019s blood. Melisandre gains nothing by giving him to the fire. Stannis wants the free folk to fight for him, he will not burn an innocent without good cause. Your boy will be safe. I will find a wet nurse for him and he\u2019ll be raised here at Castle Black under my protection. He\u2019ll learn to hunt and ride, to fight with sword and axe and bow. I\u2019ll even see that he is taught to read and write.\u201d Sam would like that. \u201cAnd when he is old enough, he will learn the truth of who he is. He\u2019ll be free to seek you out if that is what he wants.\u201d\n\u201cYou will make a crow of him.\u201d She wiped at her tears with the back of a small pale hand. \u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d\nKill the boy, thought Jon. \u201cYou will. Else I promise you, the day that they burn Dalla\u2019s boy, yours will die as well.\u201d\n\u201cDie,\u201d shrieked the Old Bear\u2019s raven. \u201cDie, die, die.\u201d\nThe girl sat hunched and shrunken, staring at the candle flame, tears glistening in her eyes. Finally Jon said, \u201cYou have my leave to go. Do not speak of this, but see that you are ready to depart an hour before first light. My men will come for you.\u201d\nGilly got to her feet. Pale and wordless, she departed, with never a look back at him. Jon heard her footsteps as she rushed through the armory. She was almost running.\nWhen he went to close the door, Jon saw that Ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, gnawing on the bone of an ox. The big white direwolf looked up at his approach. \u201cPast time that you were back.\u201d He returned to his chair, to read over Maester Aemon\u2019s letter once again.\nSamwell Tarly turned up a few moments later, clutching a stack of books. No sooner had he entered than Mormont\u2019s raven flew at him demanding corn. Sam did his best to oblige, offering some kernels from the sack beside the door. The raven did its best to peck through his palm. Sam yowled, the bird flapped off, corn scattered. \u201cDid that wretch break the skin?\u201d Jon asked.\nSam gingerly removed his glove. \u201cHe did. I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d\n\u201cWe all shed our blood for the Watch. Wear thicker gloves.\u201d Jon shoved a chair toward him with a foot. \u201cSit, and have a look at this.\u201d He handed Sam the parchment.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cA paper shield.\u201d\nSam read it slowly. \u201cA letter to King Tommen?\u201d\n\u201cAt Winterfell, Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords,\u201d Jon said, remembering. \u201cHe wore so much padding he looked like a stuffed goose. Bran knocked him to the ground.\u201d He went to the window and threw the shutters open. The air outside was cold and bracing, though the sky was a dull grey. \u201cYet Bran\u2019s dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a crown nestled amongst his golden curls.\u201d\nThat got an odd look from Sam, and for a moment he looked as if he wanted to say something. Instead he swallowed and turned back to the parchment. \u201cYou haven\u2019t signed the letter.\u201d\nJon shook his head. \u201cThe Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times. They sent him Janos Slynt. No letter will make the Lannisters love us better. Not once they hear that we\u2019ve been helping Stannis.\u201d\n\u201cOnly to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion. That\u2019s what it says here.\u201d\n\u201cThe distinction may escape Lord Tywin.\u201d Jon snatched the letter back. \u201cWhy would he help us now? He never did before.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst King Tommen was playing with his toys. That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.\u201d Jon read from the letter. \u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. Our oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. Stannis Baratheon aids us against our foes from beyond the Wall, though we are not his men\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nSam squirmed in his seat. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not. Are we?\u201d\n\u201cI gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cLord Tywin will say it was too much.\u201d\n\u201cStannis says it\u2019s not enough. The more you give a king, the more he wants. We are walking on a bridge of ice with an abyss on either side. Pleasing one king is difficult enough. Pleasing two is hardly possible.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king by aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Night\u2019s Watch. He has the Tyrells behind him, with all the strength of Highgarden. And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.\u201d\n\u201cThe Blackwater was one battle. Robb won all his battles and still lost his head. If Stannis can raise the north\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nSam hesitated, then said, \u201cThe Lannisters have northmen of their own. Lord Bolton and his bastard.\u201d\n\u201cStannis has the Karstarks. If he can win White Harbor\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf,\u201d Sam stressed. \u201cIf not\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my lord, even a paper shield is better than none.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Him and Aemon both. Somehow he had hoped that Sam Tarly might see it differently. It is only ink and parchment. Resigned, he grabbed the quill and signed. \u201cGet the sealing wax.\u201d Before I change my mind. Sam hastened to obey. Jon fixed the lord commander\u2019s seal and handed him the letter. \u201cTake this to Maester Aemon when you leave, and tell him to dispatch a bird to King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d Sam sounded relieved. \u201cMy lord, if I might ask\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I saw Gilly leaving. She was almost crying.\u201d\n\u201cVal sent her to plead for Mance again,\u201d Jon lied, and they talked for a while of Mance and Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, until the raven ate the last corn kernel and screamed, \u201cBlood.\u201d\n\u201cI am sending Gilly away,\u201d Jon said. \u201cHer and the boy. We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother.\u201d\n\u201cGoat\u2019s milk might serve, until you do. It\u2019s better for a babe than cow\u2019s milk.\u201d Talking about breasts plainly made Sam uncomfortable, and suddenly he began to speak of history, and boy commanders who had lived and died hundreds of years ago. Jon cut him off with, \u201cTell me something useful. Tell me of our enemy.\u201d\n\u201cThe Others.\u201d Sam licked his lips. \u201cThey are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I would have thought. The annals I\u2019ve found and looked at, that is. There\u2019s more I haven\u2019t found, I know. Some of the older books are falling to pieces. The pages crumble when I try and turn them. And the really old books\u00a0\u2026\u00a0either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that I haven\u2019t looked yet or\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, it could be that there are no such books and never were. The oldest histories we have were written after the Andals came to Westeros. The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later. There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it. Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, Night\u2019s King\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we say that you\u2019re the nine-hundred-and-ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, but the oldest list I\u2019ve found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it was written during\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLong ago,\u201d Jon broke in. \u201cWhat about the Others?\u201d\n\u201cI found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night\u2019s Watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part\u2019s plainly true. Some accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don\u2019t know what those are. Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.\u201d\n\u201cWe knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?\u201d\n\u201cThe armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed, and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though, and they are vulnerable to obsidian. I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of dragonsteel. Supposedly they could not stand against it.\u201d\n\u201cDragonsteel?\u201d The term was new to Jon. \u201cValyrian steel?\u201d\n\u201cThat was my first thought as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all is saved? That won\u2019t be hard.\u201d No harder than asking them to give up their coin and castles. He gave a bitter laugh. \u201cDid you find who the Others are, where they come from, what they want?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet, my lord, but it may be that I\u2019ve just been reading the wrong books. There are hundreds I have not looked at yet. Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be found.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no more time. You need to get your things together, Sam. You\u2019re going with Gilly.\u201d\n\u201cGoing?\u201d Sam gaped at him openmouthed, as if he did not understand the meaning of the word. \u201cI\u2019m going? To Eastwatch, my lord? Or\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where am I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOldtown.\u201d\n\u201cOldtown?\u201d Sam repeated, in a high-pitched squeak.\n\u201cAemon as well.\u201d\n\u201cAemon? Maester Aemon? But\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can\u2019t\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you\u2019re sending him and me? Who will tend the ravens? If there\u2019s sick or wounded, who\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cClydas. He\u2019s been with Aemon for years.\u201d\n\u201cClydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad. You need a maester. Maester Aemon is so frail, a sea voyage\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it might\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019s old, and\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHis life will be at risk. I am aware of that, Sam, but the risk is greater here. Stannis knows who Aemon is. If the red woman requires king\u2019s blood for her spells\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sam\u2019s fat cheeks seemed to drain of color.\n\u201cDareon will join you at Eastwatch. My hope is that his songs will win some men for us in the south. The Blackbird will deliver you to Braavos. From there, you\u2019ll arrange your own passage to Oldtown. If you still mean to claim Gilly\u2019s babe as your bastard, send her and the child on to Horn Hill. Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant\u2019s place for her at the Citadel.\u201d\n\u201cMy b-b-bastard. Yes, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child. Dareon could see her to Oldtown just as well as me. I\u2019m\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ve been working at my archery every afternoon with Ulmer, as you commanded\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, except when I\u2019m in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the Others. The longbow makes my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.\u201d He showed Jon his hand. \u201cI still do it, though. I can hit the target more often than not now, but I\u2019m still the worst archer who ever bent a bow. I like Ulmer\u2019s stories, though. Someone needs to write them down and put them in a book.\u201d\n\u201cYou do it. They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows. I will expect you to continue with your practice. Sam, the Night\u2019s Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, but only a handful who can read or write. I need you to become my new maester.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my work is here, the books\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0will be here when you return to us.\u201d\nSam put a hand to his throat. \u201cMy lord, the Citadel\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they make you cut up corpses there. I cannot wear a chain.\u201d\n\u201cYou can. You will. Maester Aemon is old and blind. His strength is leaving him. Who will take his place when he dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than he\u2019s sober.\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask the Citadel for more maesters\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI mean to. We\u2019ll have need of every one. Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced, however.\u201d This is not going as I had hoped. He had known Gilly would be hard, but he had assumed Sam would be glad to trade the dangers of the Wall for the warmth of Oldtown. \u201cI was certain this would please you,\u201d he said, puzzled. \u201cThere are so many books at the Citadel that no man can hope to read them all. You would do well there, Sam. I know you would.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I could read the books, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint.\u201d His hand shook, to prove the truth of that. \u201cI\u2019m Sam the Scared, not Sam the Slayer.\u201d\n\u201cScared? Of what? The chidings of old men? Sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the Fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes. You slew an Other.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Jon snapped. After Gilly, he had no patience for the fat boy\u2019s fears. \u201cYou lied and schemed and plotted to make me lord commander. You will obey me. You\u2019ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it. At least in Oldtown the corpses won\u2019t object.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord, my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the life of a maester is a life of servitude. No son of House Tarly will ever wear a chain. The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords. Jon, I cannot disobey my father.\u201d\nKill the boy, Jon thought. The boy in you, and the one in him. Kill the both of them, you bloody bastard. \u201cYou have no father. Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the Night\u2019s Watch, so go and stuff your smallclothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown. You leave an hour before sunrise. And here\u2019s another order. From this day forth, you will not call yourself a craven. You\u2019ve faced more things this past year than most men face in a lifetime. You can face the Citadel, but you\u2019ll face it as a Sworn Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. I can\u2019t command you to be brave, but I can command you to hide your fears. You said the words, Sam. Remember?\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t try. You will obey.\u201d\n\u201cObey.\u201d Mormont\u2019s raven flapped its great black wings.\nSam seemed to sag. \u201cAs my lord commands. Does\u00a0\u2026\u00a0does Maester Aemon know?\u201d\n\u201cIt was as much his idea as mine.\u201d Jon opened the door for him. \u201cNo farewells. The fewer folk who know of this, the better. An hour before first light, by the lichyard.\u201d\nSam fled from him just as Gilly had.\nJon was tired. I need sleep. He had been up half the night poring over maps, writing letters, and making plans with Maester Aemon. Even after stumbling into his narrow bed, rest had not come easily. He knew what he would face today, and found himself tossing restlessly as he brooded on Maester Aemon\u2019s final words. \u201cAllow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,\u201d the old man had said, \u201cthe same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.\u201d The old man felt Jon\u2019s face. \u201cYou are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.\u201d\nJon donned his cloak and strode outside. He made the rounds of Castle Black each day, visiting the men on watch and hearing their reports first hand, watching Ulmer and his charges at the archery butts, talking with king\u2019s men and queen\u2019s men alike, walking the ice atop the Wall to have a look at the forest. Ghost padded after him, a white shadow at his side.\nKedge Whiteye had the Wall when Jon made his ascent. Kedge had seen forty-odd namedays, thirty of them on the Wall. His left eye was blind, his right eye mean. In the wild, alone with axe and garron, he was as good a ranger as any in the Watch, but he had never gotten on well with the other men. \u201cA quiet day,\u201d he told Jon. \u201cNothing to report, except the wrong-way rangers.\u201d\n\u201cThe wrong-way rangers?\u201d Jon asked.\nKedge grinned. \u201cA pair of knights. Went riding off an hour ago, south along the kingsroad. When Dywen saw them buggering off, he said the southron fools were riding the wrong way.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Jon.\nHe found out more from Dywen himself, as the old forester sucked down a bowl of barley broth in the barracks. \u201cAye, m\u2019lord, I saw them. Horpe and Massey, it were. Claimed Stannis sent \u2019em out, but never said where or what for or when they would be back.\u201d\nSer Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey were both queen\u2019s men, and high in the king\u2019s councils. A pair of common freeriders would have served if all that Stannis had in mind was scouting, Jon Snow reflected, but knights are better suited to act as messengers or envoys. Cotter Pyke had sent word from Eastwatch that the Onion Lord and Salladhor Saan had set sail for White Harbor to treat with Lord Manderly. It made sense that Stannis would send out other envoys. His Grace was not a patient man.\nWhether the wrong-way rangers would return was another question. Knights they might be, but they did not know the north. There will be eyes along the kingsroad, not all of them friendly. It was none of Jon\u2019s concern, though. Let Stannis have his secrets. The gods know that I have mine.\nGhost slept at the foot of the bed that night, and for once Jon did not dream he was a wolf. Even so, he slept fitfully, tossing for hours before sliding down into a nightmare. Gilly was in it, weeping, pleading with him to leave her babes alone, but he ripped the children from her arms and hacked their heads off, then swapped the heads around and told her to sew them back in place.\nWhen he woke, he found Edd Tollett looming over him in the darkness of his bedchamber. \u201cM\u2019lord? It is time. The hour of the wolf. You left orders to be woken.\u201d\n\u201cBring me something hot.\u201d Jon threw off his blankets.\nEdd was back by the time that he had dressed, pressing a steaming cup into his hands. Jon expected hot mulled wine, and was surprised to find that it was soup, a thin broth that smelled of leeks and carrots but seemed to have no leeks or carrots in it. The smells are stronger in my wolf dreams, he reflected, and food tastes richer too. Ghost is more alive than I am. He left the empty cup upon the forge.\nKegs was on his door this morning. \u201cI will want to speak with Bedwyck and with Janos Slynt,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cHave them both here at first light.\u201d\nOutside the world was black and still. Cold, but not dangerously cold. Not yet. It will be warmer when the sun comes up. If the gods are good, the Wall may weep. When they reached the lichyard, the column had already formed up. Jon had given Black Jack Bulwer command of the escort, with a dozen mounted rangers under him, and two wayns. One was piled high with chests and crates and sacks, provisions for the journey. The other had a stiff roof of boiled leather to keep the wind off. Maester Aemon was seated in the back of it, huddled in a bearskin that made him look as small as a child. Sam and Gilly stood nearby. Her eyes were red and puffy, but the boy was in her arms, bundled tight. Whether it was her boy or Dalla\u2019s he could not be sure. He had only seen the two together a few times. Gilly\u2019s boy was older, Dalla\u2019s more robust, but they were close enough in age and size so that no one who did not know them well would be able to easily tell one from the other.\n\u201cLord Snow,\u201d Maester Aemon called out, \u201cI left a book for you in my chambers. The Jade Compendium. It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to the east and visited all the lands of the Jade Sea. There is a passage you may find of interest. I\u2019ve told Clydas to mark it for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to read it.\u201d\nMaester Aemon wiped his nose. \u201cKnowledge is a weapon, Jon. Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d Jon felt something wet and cold upon his face. When he raised his eyes, he saw that it was snowing. A bad omen. He turned to Black Jack Bulwer. \u201cMake as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks. You have an old man and a suckling babe with you. See that you keep them warm and well fed.\u201d\n\u201cYou do the same, m\u2019lord.\u201d Gilly did not seem in any haste to climb into the wayn. \u201cYou do the same for t\u2019other. Find another wet nurse, like you said. You promised me you would. The boy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Dalla\u2019s boy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the little prince, I mean\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my word.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you name him. Don\u2019t you do that, till he\u2019s past two years. It\u2019s ill luck to name them when they\u2019re still on the breast. You crows may not know that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me that. I\u2019m a mother, not a lady. I\u2019m Craster\u2019s wife and Craster\u2019s daughter, and a mother.\u201d She gave the babe to Dolorous Edd as she climbed into the wayn and covered herself with furs. When Edd gave her back the child, Gilly put him to her breast. Sam turned away from the sight, red-faced, and heaved himself up onto his mare. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d commanded Black Jack Bulwer, snapping his whip. The wayns rolled forward.\nSam lingered a moment. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cfarewell.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to you, Sam,\u201d said Dolorous Edd. \u201cYour boat\u2019s not like to sink, I don\u2019t think. Boats only sink when I\u2019m aboard.\u201d\nJon was remembering. \u201cThe first time I saw Gilly she was pressed back against the wall of Craster\u2019s Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with her big belly, cringing away from Ghost. He had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it?\u201d\n\u201cShe has more courage than she knows,\u201d said Sam.\n\u201cSo do you, Sam. Have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and Aemon and the child.\u201d The cold trickles on his face reminded Jon of the day he\u2019d bid farewell to Robb at Winterfell, never knowing that it was for the last time. \u201cAnd pull your hood up. The snowflakes are melting in your hair.\u201d\nBy the time the little column had dwindled in the distance, the eastern sky had gone from black to grey and the snow was falling heavily. \u201cGiant will be waiting on the lord commander\u2019s pleasure,\u201d Dolorous Edd reminded him. \u201cJanos Slynt as well.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Jon Snow glanced up at the Wall, towering over them like a cliff of ice. A hundred leagues from end to end, and seven hundred feet high. The strength of the Wall was its height; the length of the Wall was its weakness. Jon remembered something his father had said once. A wall is only as strong as the men who stand behind it. The men of the Night\u2019s Watch were brave enough, but they were far too few for the task that confronted them.\nGiant was waiting in the armory. His real name was Bedwyck. At a hair and a half over five feet he was the smallest man in the Night\u2019s Watch. Jon came directly to the point. \u201cWe need more eyes along the Wall. Way-castles where our patrols can get out of the cold and find hot food and a fresh mount. I am putting a garrison in Icemark and giving you command of it.\u201d\nGiant put the tip of his little finger in his ear to clean out the wax. \u201cCommand? Me? M\u2019lord knows I\u2019m just a crofter\u2019s get, on the Wall for poaching?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a ranger for a dozen years. You survived the Fist of the First Men and Craster\u2019s Keep, and came back to tell the tale. The younger men look up to you.\u201d\nThe small man laughed. \u201cOnly dwarfs look up to me. I don\u2019t read, my lord. On a good day I can write my name.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent to Oldtown for more maesters. You\u2019ll have two ravens for when your need is urgent. When it\u2019s not, send riders. Until we have more maesters and more birds, I mean to establish a line of beacon towers along the top of the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how many poor fools will I be commanding?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty, from the Watch,\u201d said Jon, \u201cand half as many men from Stannis.\u201d Old, green, or wounded. \u201cThey won\u2019t be his best men, and none will take the black, but they\u2019ll obey. Make what use of them you can. Four of the brothers I\u2019m sending with you will be Kingslanders who came to the Wall with Lord Slynt. Keep one eye on that lot and watch for climbers with the other.\u201d\n\u201cWe can watch, m\u2019lord, but if enough climbers gain the top o\u2019 the Wall, thirty men won\u2019t be enough to throw them off.\u201d\nThree hundred might not be enough. Jon kept that doubt to himself. It was true that climbers were desperately vulnerable whilst on the ascent. Stones and spears and pots of burning pitch could be rained down on them from above, and all they could do was cling desperately to the ice. Sometimes the Wall itself seemed to shake them off, as a dog might shake off fleas. Jon had seen that for himself, when a sheet of ice cracked beneath Val\u2019s lover Jarl, sending him to his death.\nIf the climbers reached the top of the Wall undetected, however, everything changed. Given time, they could carve out a toehold for themselves up there, throwing up ramparts of their own and dropping ropes and ladders for thousands more to clamber over after them. That was how Raymun Redbeard had done it, Raymun who had been King-Beyond-the-Wall in the days of his grandfather\u2019s grandfather. Jack Musgood had been the lord commander in those days. Jolly Jack, he was called before Redbeard came down upon the north; Sleepy Jack, forever after. Raymun\u2019s host had met a bloody end on the shores of Long Lake, caught between Lord Willam of Winterfell and the Drunken Giant, Harmond Umber. Redbeard had been slain by Artos the Implacable, Lord Willam\u2019s younger brother. The Watch arrived too late to fight the wildlings, but in time to bury them, the task that Artos Stark assigned them in his wroth as he grieved above the headless corpse of his fallen brother.\nJon did not intend to be remembered as Sleepy Jon Snow. \u201cThirty men will stand a better chance than none,\u201d he told Giant.\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d the small man said. \u201cIs it just to be Icemark, then, or will m\u2019lord be opening t\u2019other forts as well?\u201d\n\u201cI mean to garrison all of them, in time,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut for the moment, it will just be Icemark and Greyguard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd has m\u2019lord decided who\u2019s to command at Greyguard?\u201d\n\u201cJanos Slynt,\u201d said Jon. Gods save us. \u201cA man does not rise to command of the gold cloaks without ability. Slynt was born a butcher\u2019s son. He was captain of the Iron Gate when Manly Stokeworth died, and Jon Arryn raised him up and put the defense of King\u2019s Landing into his hands. Lord Janos cannot be as great a fool as he seems.\u201d And I want him well away from Alliser Thorne.\n\u201cMight be that\u2019s so,\u201d said Giant, \u201cbut I\u2019d still send him to the kitchens to help Three-Finger Hobb cut up the turnips.\u201d\nIf I did, I\u2019d never dare to eat another turnip.\nHalf the morning passed before Lord Janos reported as commanded. Jon was cleaning Longclaw. Some men would have given that task to a steward or a squire, but Lord Eddard had taught his sons to care for their own weapons. When Kegs and Dolorous Edd arrived with Slynt, Jon thanked them and bid Lord Janos sit.\nThat he did, albeit with poor grace, crossing his arms, scowling, and ignoring the naked steel in his lord commander\u2019s hands. Jon slid the oilcloth down his bastard sword, watching the play of morning light across the ripples, thinking how easily the blade would slide through skin and fat and sinew to part Slynt\u2019s ugly head from his body. All of a man\u2019s crimes were wiped away when he took the black, and all of his allegiances as well, yet he found it hard to think of Janos Slynt as a brother. There is blood between us. This man helped slay my father and did his best to have me killed as well.\n\u201cLord Janos.\u201d Jon sheathed his sword. \u201cI am giving you command of Greyguard.\u201d\nThat took Slynt aback. \u201cGreyguard\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Greyguard was where you climbed the Wall with your wildling friends\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt was. The fort is in a sorry state, admittedly. You will restore it as best you can. Start by clearing back the forest. Steal stones from the structures that have collapsed to repair those still standing.\u201d The work will be hard and brutal, he might have added. You\u2019ll sleep on stone, too exhausted to complain or plot, and soon you\u2019ll forget what it was like to be warm, but you might remember what it was to be a man. \u201cYou will have thirty men. Ten from here, ten from the Shadow Tower, and ten lent to us by King Stannis.\u201d\nSlynt\u2019s face had turned the color of a prune. His meaty jowls began to quiver. \u201cDo you think I cannot see what you are doing? Janos Slynt is not a man to be gulled so easily. I was charged with the defense of King\u2019s Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin, bastard.\u201d\nI am giving you a chance, my lord. It is more than you ever gave my father. \u201cYou mistake me, my lord,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThat was a command, not an offer. It is forty leagues to Greyguard. Pack up your arms and armor, say your farewells, and be ready to depart at first light on the morrow.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lord Janos lurched to his feet, sending his chair crashing over backwards. \u201cI will not go meekly off to freeze and die. No traitor\u2019s bastard gives commands to Janos Slynt! I am not without friends, I warn you. Here, and in King\u2019s Landing too. I was the Lord of Harrenhal! Give your ruin to one of the blind fools who cast a stone for you, I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!\u201d\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\nSlynt did not deign to answer that, but he kicked the chair aside as he departed.\nHe still sees me as a boy, Jon thought, a green boy, to be cowed by angry words. He could only hope that a night\u2019s sleep would bring Lord Janos to his senses.\nThe next morning proved that hope was vain.\nJon found Slynt breaking his fast in the common room. Ser Alliser Thorne was with him, and several of their cronies. They were laughing about something when Jon came down the steps with Iron Emmett and Dolorous Edd, and behind them Mully, Horse, Red Jack Crabb, Rusty Flowers, and Owen the Oaf. Three-Finger Hobb was ladling out porridge from his kettle. Queen\u2019s men, king\u2019s men, and black brothers sat at their separate tables, some bent over bowls of porridge, others filling their bellies with fried bread and bacon. Jon saw Pyp and Grenn at one table, Bowen Marsh at another. The air smelled of smoke and grease, and the clatter of knives and spoons echoed off the vaulted ceiling.\nAll the voices died at once.\n\u201cLord Janos,\u201d Jon said, \u201cI will give you one last chance. Put down that spoon and get to the stables. I have had your horse saddled and bridled. It is a long, hard road to Greyguard.\u201d\n\u201cThen you had best be on your way, boy.\u201d Slynt laughed, dribbling porridge down his chest. \u201cGreyguard\u2019s a good place for the likes of you, I\u2019m thinking. Well away from decent godly folk. The mark of the beast is on you, bastard.\u201d\n\u201cYou are refusing to obey my order?\u201d\n\u201cYou can stick your order up your bastard\u2019s arse,\u201d said Slynt, his jowls quivering.\nAlliser Thorne smiled a thin smile, his black eyes fixed on Jon. At another table, Godry the Giantslayer began to laugh.\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d Jon nodded to Iron Emmett. \u201cPlease take Lord Janos to the Wall\u2014\u201d\n\u2014and confine him to an ice cell, he might have said. A day or ten cramped up inside the ice would leave him shivering and feverish and begging for release, Jon did not doubt. And the moment he is out, he and Thorne will begin to plot again.\n\u2014and tie him to his horse, he might have said. If Slynt did not wish to go to Greyguard as its commander, he could go as its cook. It will only be a matter of time until he deserts, then. And how many others will he take with him?\n\u201c\u2014and hang him,\u201d Jon finished.\nJanos Slynt\u2019s face went as white as milk. The spoon slipped from his fingers. Edd and Emmett crossed the room, their footsteps ringing on the stone floor. Bowen Marsh\u2019s mouth opened and closed though no words came out. Ser Alliser Thorne reached for his sword hilt. Go on, Jon thought. Longclaw was slung across his back. Show your steel. Give me cause to do the same.\nHalf the men in the hall were on their feet. Southron knights and men-at-arms, loyal to King Stannis or the red woman or both, and Sworn Brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch. Some had chosen Jon to be their lord commander. Others had cast their stones for Bowen Marsh, Ser Denys Mallister, Cotter Pyke\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and some for Janos Slynt. Hundreds of them, as I recall. Jon wondered how many of those men were in the cellar right now. For a moment the world balanced on a sword\u2019s edge.\nAlliser Thorne took his hand from his sword and stepped aside to let Edd Tollett pass.\nDolorous Edd took hold of Slynt by one arm, Iron Emmett by the other. Together they hauled him from the bench. \u201cNo,\u201d Lord Janos protested, flecks of porridge spraying from his lips. \u201cNo, unhand me. He\u2019s just a boy, a bastard. His father was a traitor. The mark of the beast is on him, that wolf of his\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Let go of me! You will rue the day you laid hands on Janos Slynt. I have friends in King\u2019s Landing. I warn you\u2014\u201d He was still protesting as they half-marched, half-dragged him up the steps.\nJon followed them outside. Behind him, the cellar emptied. At the cage, Slynt wrenched loose for a moment and tried to make a fight of it, but Iron Emmett caught him by the throat and slammed him back against the iron bars until he desisted. By then all of Castle Black had come outside to watch. Even Val was at her window, her long golden braid across one shoulder. Stannis stood on the steps of the King\u2019s Tower, surrounded by his knights.\n\u201cIf the boy thinks that he can frighten me, he is mistaken,\u201d they heard Lord Janos said. \u201cHe would not dare to hang me. Janos Slynt has friends, important friends, you\u2019ll see\u00a0\u2026\u201d The wind whipped away the rest of his words.\nThis is wrong, Jon thought. \u201cStop.\u201d\nEmmett turned back, frowning. \u201cMy lord?\u201d\n\u201cI will not hang him,\u201d said Jon. \u201cBring him here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Seven save us,\u201d he heard Bowen Marsh cry out.\nThe smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, \u201cEdd, fetch me a block,\u201d and unsheathed Longclaw.\nBy the time a suitable chopping block was found, Lord Janos had retreated into the winch cage, but Iron Emmett went in after him and dragged him out. \u201cNo,\u201d Slynt cried, as Emmett half-shoved and halfpulled him across the yard. \u201cUnhand me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you cannot\u00a0\u2026\u00a0when Tywin Lannister hears of this, you will all rue\u2014\u201d\nEmmett kicked his legs out from under him. Dolorous Edd planted a foot on his back to keep him on his knees as Emmett shoved the block beneath his head. \u201cThis will go easier if you stay still,\u201d Jon Snow promised him. \u201cMove to avoid the cut, and you will still die, but your dying will be uglier. Stretch out your neck, my lord.\u201d The pale morning sunlight ran up and down his blade as Jon clasped the hilt of the bastard sword with both hands and raised it high. \u201cIf you have any last words, now is the time to speak them,\u201d he said, expecting one last curse.\nJanos Slynt twisted his neck around to stare up at him. \u201cPlease, my lord. Mercy. I\u2019ll\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019ll go, I will, I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nNo, thought Jon. You closed that door. Longclaw descended.\n\u201cCan I have his boots?\u201d asked Owen the Oaf, as Janos Slynt\u2019s head went rolling across the muddy ground. \u201cThey\u2019re almost new, those boots. Lined with fur.\u201d\nJon glanced back at Stannis. For an instant their eyes met. Then the king nodded and went back inside his tower.",

      "content": "TYRION\nHe woke alone, and found the litter halted.\nA pile of crushed cushions remained to show where Illyrio had sprawled. The dwarf\u2019s throat felt dry and raspy. He had dreamed\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what had he dreamed? He did not remember.\nOutside, voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Tyrion swung his legs through the curtains and hopped to the ground, to find Magister Illyrio standing by the horses with two riders looming over him. Both wore shirts of worn leather beneath cloaks of dark brown wool, but their swords were sheathed and the fat man did not look to be in danger.\n\u201cI need a piss,\u201d the dwarf announced. He waddled off the road, undid his breeches, and relieved himself into a tangle of thorns. It took quite a long time.\n\u201cHe pisses well, at least,\u201d a voice observed.\nTyrion flicked the last drops off and tucked himself away. \u201cPissing is the least of my talents. You ought to see me shit.\u201d He turned to Magister Illyrio. \u201cAre these two known to you, magister? They look like outlaws. Should I find my axe?\u201d\n\u201cYour axe?\u201d exclaimed the larger of the riders, a brawny man with a shaggy beard and a shock of orange hair. \u201cDid you hear that, Haldon? The little man wants to fight with us!\u201d\nHis companion was older, clean-shaved, with a lined ascetic face. His hair had been pulled back and tied in a knot behind his head. \u201cSmall men oft feel a need to prove their courage with unseemly boasts,\u201d he declared. \u201cI doubt if he could kill a duck.\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cFetch the duck.\u201d\n\u201cIf you insist.\u201d The rider glanced at his companion.\nThe brawny man unsheathed a bastard sword. \u201cI\u2019m Duck, you mouthy little pisspot.\u201d\nOh, gods be good. \u201cI had a smaller duck in mind.\u201d\nThe big man roared with laughter. \u201cDid you hear, Haldon? He wants a smaller Duck!\u201d\n\u201cI should gladly settle for a quieter one.\u201d The man called Haldon studied Tyrion with cool grey eyes before turning back to Illyrio. \u201cYou have some chests for us?\u201d\n\u201cAnd mules to carry them.\u201d\n\u201cMules are too slow. We have pack horses, we\u2019ll shift the chests to them. Duck, attend to that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it always Duck who attends to things?\u201d The big man slipped his sword back in its sheath. \u201cWhat do you attend to, Haldon? Who is the knight here, you or me?\u201d Yet he stomped off toward the baggage mules all the same.\n\u201cHow fares our lad?\u201d asked Illyrio as the chests were being secured. Tyrion counted six, oaken chests with iron hasps. Duck shifted them easily enough, hoisting them on one shoulder.\n\u201cHe is as tall as Griff now. Three days ago he knocked Duck into a horse trough.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t knocked. I fell in just to make him laugh.\u201d\n\u201cYour ploy was a success,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cI laughed myself.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a gift for the boy in one of the chests. Some candied ginger. He was always fond of it.\u201d Illyrio sounded oddly sad. \u201cI thought I might continue on to Ghoyan Drohe with you. A farewell feast before you start downriver\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe have no time for feasts, my lord,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cGriff means to strike downriver the instant we are back. News has been coming upriver, none of it good. Dothraki have been seen north of Dagger Lake, outriders from old Motho\u2019s khalasar, and Khal Zekko is not far behind him, moving through the Forest of Qohor.\u201d\nThe fat man made a rude noise. \u201cZekko visits Qohor every three or four years. The Qohorik give him a sack of gold and he turns east again. As for Motho, his men are near as old as he is, and there are fewer every year. The threat is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Khal Pono,\u201d Haldon finished. \u201cMotho and Zekko flee from him, if the tales are true. The last reports had Pono near the headwaters of the Selhoru with a khalasar of thirty thousand. Griff does not want to risk being caught up in the crossing if Pono should decide to risk the Rhoyne.\u201d Haldon glanced at Tyrion. \u201cDoes your dwarf ride as well as he pisses?\u201d\n\u201cHe rides,\u201d Tyrion broke in, before the lord of cheese could answer for him, \u201cthough he rides best with a special saddle and a horse that he knows well. He talks as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo he does. I am Haldon, the healer in our little band of brothers. Some call me Halfmaester. My companion is Ser Duck.\u201d\n\u201cSer Rolly,\u201d said the big man. \u201cRolly Duckfield. Any knight can make a knight, and Griff made me. And you, dwarf?\u201d\nIllyrio spoke up quickly. \u201cYollo, he is called.\u201d\nYollo? Yollo sounds like something you might name a monkey. Worse, it was a Pentoshi name, and any fool could see that Tyrion was no Pentoshi. \u201cIn Pentos I am Yollo,\u201d he said quickly, to make what amends he could, \u201cbut my mother named me Hugor Hill.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a little king or a little bastard?\u201d asked Haldon.\nTyrion realized he would do well to be careful around Haldon Halfmaester. \u201cEvery dwarf is a bastard in his father\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt. Well, Hugor Hill, answer me this. How did Serwyn of the Mirror Shield slay the dragon Urrax?\u201d\n\u201cHe approached behind his shield. Urrax saw only his own reflection until Serwyn had plunged his spear through his eye.\u201d\nHaldon was unimpressed. \u201cEven Duck knows that tale. Can you tell me the name of the knight who tried the same ploy with Vhagar during the Dance of the Dragons?\u201d\nTyrion grinned. \u201cSer Byron Swann. He was roasted for his trouble\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only the dragon was Syrax, not Vhagar.\u201d\n\u201cI fear that you\u2019re mistaken. In The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling, Maester Munkun writes\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014that it was Vhagar. Grand Maester Munkun errs. Ser Byron\u2019s squire saw his master die, and wrote his daughter of the manner of it. His account says it was Syrax, Rhaenyra\u2019s she-dragon, which makes more sense than Munken\u2019s version. Swann was the son of a marcher lord, and Storm\u2019s End was for Aegon. Vhagar was ridden by Prince Aemond, Aegon\u2019s brother. Why should Swann want to slay her?\u201d\nHaldon pursed his lips. \u201cTry not to tumble off the horse. If you do, best waddle back to Pentos. Our shy maid will not wait for man nor dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cShy maids are my favorite sort. Aside from wanton ones. Tell me, where do whores go?\u201d\n\u201cDo I look like a man who frequents whores?\u201d\nDuck laughed derisively. \u201cHe don\u2019t dare. Lemore would make him pray for pardon, the lad would want to come along, and Griff might cut his cock off and stuff it down his throat.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201ca maester does not need a cock.\u201d\n\u201cHaldon\u2019s only half a maester, though.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to find the dwarf amusing, Duck,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cHe can ride with you.\u201d He wheeled his mount about.\nIt took another few moments for Duck to finish securing Illyrio\u2019s chests to the three pack horses. By that time Haldon had vanished. Duck seemed unconcerned. He swung into the saddle, grabbed Tyrion by the collar, and hoisted the little man up in front of him. \u201cHold tight to the pommel and you\u2019ll do fine. The mare\u2019s got a nice sweet gait, and the dragon road\u2019s smooth as a maiden\u2019s arse.\u201d Gathering the reins in his right hand and the leads in his left, Ser Rolly set off at a brisk trot.\n\u201cGood fortune,\u201d Illyrio called after them. \u201cTell the boy I am sorry that I will not be with him for his wedding. I will rejoin you in Westeros. That I swear, by my sweet Serra\u2019s hands.\u201d\nThe last that Tyrion Lannister saw of Illyrio Mopatis, the magister was standing by his litter in his brocade robes, his massive shoulders slumped. As his figure dwindled in their dust, the lord of cheese looked almost small.\nDuck caught up with Haldon Halfmaester a quarter mile on. Thereafter the riders continued side by side. Tyrion clung to the high pommel with his short legs splayed out awkwardly, knowing he could look forward to blisters, cramps, and saddle sores.\n\u201cI wonder what the pirates of Dagger Lake will make of our dwarf?\u201d Haldon said as they rode on.\n\u201cDwarf stew?\u201d suggested Duck.\n\u201cUrho the Unwashed is the worst of them,\u201d Haldon confided. \u201cHis stench alone is enough to kill a man.\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cFortunately, I have no nose.\u201d\nHaldon gave him a thin smile. \u201cIf we should encounter the Lady Korra on Hag\u2019s Teeth, you may soon be lacking other parts as well. Korra the Cruel, they call her. Her ship is crewed by beautiful young maids who geld every male they capture.\u201d\n\u201cTerrifying. I may well piss my breeches.\u201d\n\u201cBest not,\u201d Duck warned darkly.\n\u201cAs you say. If we encounter this Lady Korra, I will just slip into a skirt and say that I am Cersei, the famous bearded beauty of King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\nThis time Duck laughed, and Haldon said, \u201cWhat a droll little fellow you are, Yollo. They say that the Shrouded Lord will grant a boon to any man who can make him laugh. Perhaps His Grey Grace will choose you to ornament his stony court.\u201d\nDuck glanced at his companion uneasily. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to jape of that one, not when we\u2019re so near the Rhoyne. He hears.\u201d\n\u201cWisdom from a duck,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cI beg your pardon, Yollo. You need not look so pale, I was only playing with you. The Prince of Sorrows does not bestow his grey kiss lightly.\u201d\nHis grey kiss. The thought made his flesh crawl. Death had lost its terror for Tyrion Lannister, but greyscale was another matter. The Shrouded Lord is just a legend, he told himself, no more real than the ghost of Lann the Clever that some claim haunts Casterly Rock. Even so, he held his tongue.\nThe dwarf\u2019s sudden silence went unnoticed, as Duck had begun to regale him with his own life story. His father had been an armorer at Bitterbridge, he said, so he had been born with the sound of steel ringing in his ears and had taken to swordplay at an early age. Such a large and likely lad drew the eye of old Lord Caswell, who offered him a place in his garrison, but the boy had wanted more. He watched Caswell\u2019s weakling son named a page, a squire, and finally a knight. \u201cA weedy pinch-faced sneak, he was, but the old lord had four daughters and only the one son, so no one was allowed to say a word against him. T\u2019other squires hardly dared to lay a finger on him in the yard.\u201d\n\u201cYou were not so timid, though.\u201d Tyrion could see where this tale was going easily enough.\n\u201cMy father made a longsword for me to mark my sixteenth nameday,\u201d said Duck, \u201cbut Lorent liked the look of it so much he took it for himself, and my bloody father never dared to tell him no. When I complained, Lorent told me to my face that my hand was made to hold a hammer, not a sword. So I went and got a hammer and beat him with it, till both his arms and half his ribs were broken. After that I had to leave the Reach, quick as it were. I made it across the water to the Golden Company. I did some smithing for a few years as a \u2019prentice, then Ser Harry Strickland took me on as squire. When Griff sent word downriver that he needed someone to help train his son to arms, Harry sent him me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Griff knighted you?\u201d\n\u201cA year later.\u201d\nHaldon Halfmaester smiled a thin smile. \u201cTell our little friend how you came by your name, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cA knight needs more than just the one name,\u201d the big man insisted, \u201cand, well, we were in a field when he dubbed me, and I looked up and saw these ducks, so\u00a0\u2026\u00a0don\u2019t laugh, now.\u201d\nJust after sunset, they left the road to rest in an overgrown yard beside an old stone well. Tyrion hopped down to work the cramps out of his calves whilst Duck and Haldon were watering the horses. Tough brown grass and weed trees sprouted from the gaps between the cobbles, and the mossy walls of what once might have been a huge stone manse. After the animals had been tended to, the riders shared a simple supper of salt pork and cold white beans, washed down with ale. Tyrion found the plain fare a pleasant change from all the rich food he had eaten with Illyrio. \u201cThose chests we brought you,\u201d he said as they were chewing. \u201cGold for the Golden Company, I thought at first, until I saw Ser Rolly hoist a chest onto one shoulder. If it were full of coin, he could never have lifted it so easily.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just armor,\u201d said Duck, with a shrug.\n\u201cClothing as well,\u201d Haldon broke in. \u201cCourt clothes, for all our party. Fine woolens, velvets, silken cloaks. One does not come before a queen looking shabby\u00a0\u2026\u00a0nor empty-handed. The magister has been kind enough to provide us with suitable gifts.\u201d\nCome moonrise, they were back in their saddles, trotting eastward under a mantle of stars. The old Valyrian road glimmered ahead of them like a long silver ribbon winding through wood and dale. For a little while Tyrion Lannister felt almost at peace. \u201cLomas Longstrider told it true. The road\u2019s a wonder.\u201d\n\u201cLomas Longstrider?\u201d asked Duck.\n\u201cA scribe, long dead,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cHe spent his life traveling the world and writing about the lands he visited in two books he called Wonders and Wonders Made by Man.\u201d\n\u201cAn uncle of mine gave them to me when I was just a boy,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cI read them until they fell to pieces.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods made seven wonders, and mortal man made nine,\u201d quoted the Halfmaester. \u201cRather impious of mortal man to do the gods two better, but there you are. The stone roads of Valyria were one of Longstrider\u2019s nine. The fifth, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cThe fourth,\u201d said Tyrion, who had committed all sixteen of the wonders to memory as a boy. His uncle Gerion liked to set him on the table during feasts and make him recite them. I liked that well enough, didn\u2019t I? Standing there amongst the trenchers with every eye upon me, proving what a clever little imp I was. For years afterward, he had cherished a dream that one day he would travel the world and see Longstrider\u2019s wonders for himself.\nLord Tywin had put an end to that hope ten days before his dwarf son\u2019s sixteenth nameday, when Tyrion asked to tour the Nine Free Cities, as his uncles had done at that same age. \u201cMy brothers could be relied upon to bring no shame upon House Lannister,\u201d his father had replied. \u201cNeither ever wed a whore.\u201d And when Tyrion had reminded him that in ten days he would be a man grown, free to travel where he wished, Lord Tywin had said, \u201cNo man is free. Only children and fools think elsewise. Go, by all means. Wear motley and stand upon your head to amuse the spice lords and the cheese kings. Just see that you pay your own way and put aside any thoughts of returning.\u201d At that the boy\u2019s defiance had crumbled. \u201cIf it is useful occupation you require, useful occupation you shall have,\u201d his father then said. So to mark his manhood, Tyrion was given charge of all the drains and cisterns within Casterly Rock. Perhaps he hoped I\u2019d fall into one. But Tywin had been disappointed in that. The drains never drained half so well as when he had charge of them.\nI need a cup of wine, to wash the taste of Tywin from my mouth. A skin of wine would serve me even better.\nThey rode all night, with Tyrion sleeping fitfully, dozing against the pommel and waking suddenly. From time to time he would begin to slip sideways from the saddle, but Ser Rolly would get a hand on him and yank him upright once again. By dawn the dwarf\u2019s legs were aching and his cheeks were chafed and raw.\nIt was the next day before they reached the site of Ghoyan Drohe, hard beside the river. \u201cThe fabled Rhoyne,\u201d said Tyrion when he glimpsed the slow green waterway from atop a rise.\n\u201cThe Little Rhoyne,\u201d said Duck.\n\u201cIt is that.\u201d A pleasant enough river, I suppose, but the smallest fork of the Trident is twice as wide, and all three of them run swifter. The city was no more impressive. Ghoyan Drohe had never been large, Tyrion recalled from his histories, but it had been a fair place, green and flowering, a city of canals and fountains. Until the war. Until the dragons came. A thousand years later, the canals were choked with reeds and mud, and pools of stagnant water gave birth to swarms of flies. The broken stones of temples and palaces were sinking back into the earth, and gnarled old willows grew thick along the riverbanks.\nA few people still remained amidst the squalor, tending little gardens in amongst the weeds. The sound of iron hooves ringing on the old Valyrian road sent most of them darting back into the holes they\u2019d crawled from, but the bolder ones lingered in the sun long enough to stare at the passing riders with dull, incurious eyes. One naked girl with mud up to her knees could not seem to take her eyes off Tyrion. She has never seen a dwarf before, he realized, much less a dwarf without a nose. He made a face and stuck his tongue out, and the girl began to cry.\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Duck asked.\n\u201cI blew her a kiss. All the girls cry when I kiss them.\u201d\nBeyond the tangled willows the road ended abruptly and they turned north for a short ways and rode beside the water, until the brush gave way and they found themselves beside an old stone quay, half-submerged and surrounded by tall brown weeds. \u201cDuck!\u201d came a shout. \u201cHaldon!\u201d Tyrion craned his head to one side, and saw a boy standing on the roof of a low wooden building, waving a wide-brimmed straw hat. He was a lithe and well-made youth, with a lanky build and a shock of dark blue hair. The dwarf put his age at fifteen, sixteen, or near enough to make no matter.\nThe roof the boy was standing on turned out to be the cabin of the Shy Maid, an old ramshackle single-masted poleboat. She had a broad beam and a shallow draft, ideal for making her way up the smallest of streams and crabwalking over sandbars. A homely maid, thought Tyrion, but sometimes the ugliest ones are the hungriest once abed. The poleboats that plied the rivers of Dorne were often brightly painted and exquisitely carved, but not this maid. Her paintwork was a muddy greyish brown, mottled and flaking; her big curved tiller, plain and unadorned. She looks like dirt, he thought, but no doubt that\u2019s the point.\nDuck was hallooing back by then. The mare splashed through the shallows, trampling down the reeds. The boy leapt down off the cabin roof to the poleboat\u2019s deck, and the rest of the Shy Maid\u2019s crew made their appearance. An older couple with a Rhoynish cast to their features stood close beside the tiller, whilst a handsome septa in a soft white robe stepped through the cabin door and pushed a lock of dark brown hair from her eyes.\nBut there was no mistaking Griff. \u201cThat will be enough shouting,\u201d he said. A sudden silence fell upon the river.\nThis one will be trouble, Tyrion knew at once.\nGriff\u2019s cloak was made from the hide and head of a red wolf of the Rhoyne. Under the pelt he wore brown leather stiffened with iron rings. His clean-shaved face was leathery too, with wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Though his hair was as blue as his son\u2019s, he had red roots and redder eyebrows. At his hip hung a sword and dagger. If he was happy to have Duck and Haldon back again, he hid it well, but he did not trouble to conceal his displeasure at the sight of Tyrion. \u201cA dwarf? What\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cI know, you were hoping for a wheel of cheese.\u201d Tyrion turned to Young Griff and gave the lad his most disarming smile. \u201cBlue hair may serve you well in Tyrosh, but in Westeros children will throw stones at you and girls will laugh in your face.\u201d\nThe lad was taken aback. \u201cMy mother was a lady of Tyrosh. I dye my hair in memory of her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this creature?\u201d Griff demanded.\nHaldon answered. \u201cIllyrio sent a letter to explain.\u201d\n\u201cI will have it, then. Take the dwarf to my cabin.\u201d\nI do not like his eyes, Tyrion reflected, when the sellsword sat down across from him in the dimness of the boat\u2019s interior, with a scarred plank table and a tallow candle between them. They were ice blue, pale, cold. The dwarf misliked pale eyes. Lord Tywin\u2019s eyes had been pale green and flecked with gold.\nHe watched the sellsword read. That he could read said something all by itself. How many sellswords could boast of that? He hardly moves his lips at all, Tyrion reflected.\nFinally Griff looked up from the parchment, and those pale eyes narrowed. \u201cTywin Lannister dead? At your hand?\u201d\n\u201cAt my finger. This one.\u201d Tyrion held it up for Griff to admire. \u201cLord Tywin was sitting on a privy, so I put a crossbow bolt through his bowels to see if he really did shit gold. He didn\u2019t. A pity, I could have used some gold. I also slew my mother, somewhat earlier. Oh, and my nephew Joffrey, I poisoned him at his wedding feast and watched him choke to death. Did the cheesemonger leave that part out? I mean to add my brother and sister to the list before I\u2019m done, if it please your queen.\u201d\n\u201cPlease her? Has Illyrio taken leave of his senses? Why does he imagine that Her Grace would welcome the service of a self-confessed kingslayer and betrayer?\u201d\nA fair question, thought Tyrion, but what he said was, \u201cThe king I slew was sitting on her throne, and all those I betrayed were lions, so it seems to me that I have already done the queen good service.\u201d He scratched the stump of his nose. \u201cHave no fear, I won\u2019t kill you, you are no kin of mine. Might I see what the cheesemonger wrote? I do love to read about myself.\u201d\nGriff ignored the request. Instead he touched the letter to the candle flame and watched the parchment blacken, curl, and flare up. \u201cThere is blood between Targaryen and Lannister. Why would you support the cause of Queen Daenerys?\u201d\n\u201cFor gold and glory,\u201d the dwarf said cheerfully. \u201cOh, and hate. If you had ever met my sister, you would understand.\u201d\n\u201cI understand hate well enough.\u201d From the way Griff said the word, Tyrion knew that much was true. He has supped on hate himself, this one. It has warmed him in the night for years.\n\u201cThen we have that in common, ser.\u201d\n\u201cI am no knight.\u201d\nNot only a liar, but a bad one. That was clumsy and stupid, my lord. \u201cAnd yet Ser Duck says you knighted him.\u201d\n\u201cDuck talks too much.\u201d\n\u201cSome might wonder that a duck can talk at all. No matter, Griff. You are no knight and I am Hugor Hill, a little monster. Your little monster, if you like. You have my word, all that I desire is to be leal servant of your dragon queen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you propose to serve her?\u201d\n\u201cWith my tongue.\u201d He licked his fingers, one by one. \u201cI can tell Her Grace how my sweet sister thinks, if you call it thinking. I can tell her captains the best way to defeat my brother, Jaime, in battle. I know which lords are brave and which are craven, which are loyal and which are venal. I can deliver allies to her. And I know much and more of dragons, as your halfmaester will tell you. I\u2019m amusing too, and I don\u2019t eat much. Consider me your own true imp.\u201d\nGriff weighed that for a moment. \u201cUnderstand this, dwarf. You are the last and least of our company. Hold your tongue and do as you are told, or you will soon wish you had.\u201d\nYes, Father, Tyrion almost said. \u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI am no lord.\u201d\nLiar. \u201cIt was a courtesy, my friend.\u201d\n\u201cI am not your friend either.\u201d\nNo knight, no lord, no friend. \u201cA pity.\u201d\n\u201cSpare me your irony. I will take you as far as Volantis. If you show yourself to be obedient and useful, you may remain with us, to serve the queen as best you can. Prove yourself more trouble than you are worth, and you can go your own way.\u201d\nAye, and my way will take me to the bottom of the Rhoyne with fish nibbling at what\u2019s left of my nose. \u201cValar dohaeris.\u201d\n\u201cYou may sleep on the deck or in the hold, as you prefer. Ysilla will find bedding for you.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of her.\u201d Tyrion made a waddling bow, but at the cabin door, he turned back. \u201cWhat if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor\u2019s drunken fancy? This wide world is full of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids, rock goblins, winged horses, winged pigs\u00a0\u2026\u00a0winged lions.\u201d\nGriff stared at him, frowning. \u201cI have given you fair warning, Lannister. Guard your tongue or lose it. Kingdoms are at hazard here. Our lives, our names, our honor. This is no game we\u2019re playing for your amusement.\u201d\nOf course it is, thought Tyrion. The game of thrones. \u201cAs you say, Captain,\u201d he murmured, bowing once again.",

      "content": "DAVOS\nLightning split the northern sky, etching the black tower of the Night Lamp against the blue-white sky. Six heartbeats later came the thunder, like a distant drum.\nThe guards marched Davos Seaworth across a bridge of black basalt and under an iron portcullis showing signs of rust. Beyond lay a deep salt moat and a drawbridge supported by a pair of massive chains. Green waters surged below, sending up plumes of spray to smash against the foundations of the castle. Then came a second gatehouse, larger than the first, its stones bearded with green algae. Davos stumbled across a muddy yard with his hands bound at the wrists. A cold rain stung his eyes. The guards prodded him up the steps, into Breakwater\u2019s cavernous stone keep.\nOnce inside, the captain removed his cloak and hung it from a peg, so as not to leave puddles on the threadbare Myrish carpet. Davos did the same, fumbling at the clasp with his bound hands. He had not forgotten the courtesies he had learned on Dragonstone during his years of service.\nThey found the lord alone in the gloom of his hall, making a supper of beer and bread and sister\u2019s stew. Twenty iron sconces were mounted along his thick stone walls, but only four held torches, and none of them was lit. Two fat tallow candles gave a meagre, flickering light. Davos could hear the rain lashing at the walls, and a steady dripping where the roof had sprung a leak.\n\u201cM\u2019lord,\u201d said the captain, \u201cwe found this man in the Belly o\u2019 the Whale, trying to buy his way off island. He had twelve dragons on him, and this thing too.\u201d The captain put it on the table by the lord: a wide ribbon of black velvet trimmed with cloth-of-gold, and bearing three seals; a crowned stag stamped in golden beeswax, a flaming heart in red, a hand in white.\nDavos waited wet and dripping, his wrists chafing where the wet rope dug into his skin. One word from this lord and he would soon be hanging from the Gallows Gate of Sisterton, but at least he was out of the rain, with solid stone beneath his feet in place of a heaving deck. He was soaked and sore and haggard, worn thin by grief and betrayal, and sick to death of storms.\nThe lord wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and picked up the ribbon for a closer squint. Lightning flashed outside, making the arrow loops blaze blue and white for half a heartbeat. One, two, three, four, Davos counted, before the thunder came. When it quieted, he listened to the dripping, and the duller roar beneath his feet, where the waves were smashing against Breakwater\u2019s huge stone arches and swirling through its dungeons. He might well end up down there, fettered to a wet stone floor and left to drown when the tide came rushing in. No, he tried to tell himself, a smuggler might die that way, but not a King\u2019s Hand. I\u2019m worth more if he sells me to his queen.\nThe lord fingered the ribbon, frowning at the seals. He was an ugly man, big and fleshy, with an oarsman\u2019s thick shoulders and no neck. Coarse grey stubble, going white in patches, covered his cheeks and chin. Above a massive shelf of brow he was bald. His nose was lumpy and red with broken veins, his lips thick, and he had a sort of webbing between the three middle fingers of his right hand. Davos had heard that some of the lords of the Three Sisters had webbed hands and feet, but he had always put that down as just another sailor\u2019s story.\nThe lord leaned back. \u201cCut him free,\u201d he said, \u201cand peel those gloves off him. I want to see his hands.\u201d\nThe captain did as he was told. As he jerked up his captive\u2019s maimed left hand the lightning flashed again, throwing the shadow of Davos Seaworth\u2019s shortened fingers across the blunt and brutal face of Godric Borrell, Lord of Sweetsister. \u201cAny man can steal a ribbon,\u201d the lord said, \u201cbut those fingers do not lie. You are the onion knight.\u201d\n\u201cI have been called that, my lord.\u201d Davos was a lord himself, and had been a knight for long years now, but deep down he was still what he had always been, a smuggler of common birth who had bought his knighthood with a hold of onions and salt fish. \u201cI have been called worse things too.\u201d\n\u201cAye. Traitor. Rebel. Turncloak.\u201d\nHe bristled at the last. \u201cI have never turned my cloak, my lord. I am a king\u2019s man.\u201d\n\u201cOnly if Stannis is a king.\u201d The lord weighed him with hard black eyes. \u201cMost knights who land upon my shores seek me in my hall, not in the Belly of the Whale. A vile smuggler\u2019s den, that place. Are you returning to your old trade, onion knight?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lord. I was looking for passage to White Harbor. The king sent me, with a message for its lord.\u201d\n\u201cThen you are in the wrong place, with the wrong lord.\u201d Lord Godric seemed amused. \u201cThis is Sisterton, on Sweetsister.\u201d\n\u201cI know it is.\u201d There was nothing sweet about Sisterton, though. It was a vile town, a sty, small and mean and rank with the odors of pig shit and rotting fish. Davos remembered it well from his smuggling days. The Three Sisters had been a favorite haunt of smugglers for hundreds of years, and a pirate\u2019s nest before that. Sisterton\u2019s streets were mud and planks, its houses daub-and-wattle hovels roofed with straw, and by the Gallows Gate there were always hanged men with their entrails dangling out.\n\u201cYou have friends here, I do not doubt,\u201d said the lord. \u201cEvery smuggler has friends on the Sisters. Some of them are my friends as well. The ones who aren\u2019t, them I hang. I let them strangle slowly, with their guts slapping up against their knees.\u201d The hall grew bright again, as lightning lit the windows. Two heartbeats later came the thunder. \u201cIf it is White Harbor that you want, why are you in Sisterton? What brought you here?\u201d\nA king\u2019s command and a friend\u2019s betrayal, Davos might have said. Instead he answered, \u201cStorms.\u201d\nNine-and-twenty ships had set sail from the Wall. If half of them were still afloat, Davos would be shocked. Black skies, bitter winds, and lashing rains had hounded them all the way down the coast. The galleys Oledo and Old Mother\u2019s Son had been driven onto the rocks of Skagos, the isle of unicorns and cannibals where even the Blind Bastard had feared to land; the great cog Saathos Saan had foundered off the Grey Cliffs. \u201cStannis will be paying for them,\u201d Salladhor Saan had fumed. \u201cHe will be paying for them with good gold, every one.\u201d It was as if some angry god was exacting payment for their easy voyage north, when they had ridden a steady southerly from Dragonstone to the Wall. Another gale had ripped away the rigging of the Bountiful Harvest, forcing Salla to have her taken under tow. Ten leagues north of Widow\u2019s Watch the seas rose again, slamming the Harvest into one of the galleys towing her and sinking both. The rest of the Lysene fleet had been scattered across the narrow sea. Some would straggle into one port or another. Others would never be seen again.\n\u201cSalladhor the Beggar, that\u2019s what your king has made me,\u201d Salladhor Saan complained to Davos, as the remnants of his fleet limped across the Bite. \u201cSalladhor the Smashed. Where are my ships? And my gold, where is all the gold that I was promised?\u201d When Davos had tried to assure him that he would have his payment, Salla had erupted. \u201cWhen, when? On the morrow, on the new moon, when the red comet comes again? He is promising me gold and gems, always promising, but this gold I have not seen. I have his word, he is saying, oh yes, his royal word, he writes it down. Can Salladhor Saan eat the king\u2019s word? Can he quench his thirst with parchments and waxy seals? Can he tumble promises into a feather bed and fuck them till they squeal?\u201d\nDavos had tried to persuade him to stay true. If Salla abandoned Stannis and his cause, he pointed out, he abandoned all hope of collecting the gold that was due him. A victorious King Tommen was not like to pay his defeated uncle\u2019s debts, after all. Salla\u2019s only hope was to remain loyal to Stannis Baratheon until he won the Iron Throne. Elsewise he would never see a groat of his money. He had to be patient.\nPerhaps some lord with honey on his tongue might have swayed the Lysene pirate prince, but Davos was an onion knight, and his words had only provoked Salla to fresh outrage. \u201cOn Dragonstone I was patient,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen the red woman burned wooden gods and screaming men. All the long way to the Wall I was patient. At Eastwatch I was patient\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and cold, so very cold. Bah, I say. Bah to your patience, and bah to your king. My men are hungry. They are wishing to fuck their wives again, to count their sons, to see the Stepstones and the pleasure gardens of Lys. Ice and storms and empty promises, these they are not wanting. This north is much too cold, and getting colder.\u201d\nI knew the day would come, Davos told himself. I was fond of the old rogue, but never so great a fool as to trust him.\n\u201cStorms.\u201d Lord Godric said the word as fondly as another man might say his lover\u2019s name. \u201cStorms were sacred on the Sisters before the Andals came. Our gods of old were the Lady of the Waves and the Lord of the Skies. They made storms every time they mated.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cThese kings never bother with the Sisters. Why should they? We are small and poor. And yet you\u2019re here. Delivered to me by the storms.\u201d\nDelivered to you by a friend, Davos thought.\nLord Godric turned to his captain. \u201cLeave this man with me. He was never here.\u201d\n\u201cNo, m\u2019lord. Never.\u201d The captain took his leave, his wet boots leaving damp footprints across the carpet. Beneath the floor the sea was rumbling and restless, pounding at the castle\u2019s feet. The outer door closed with a sound like distant thunder, and again the lightning came, as if in answer.\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d said Davos, \u201cif you would send me on to White Harbor, His Grace would count it as an act of friendship.\u201d\n\u201cI could send you to White Harbor,\u201d the lord allowed. \u201cOr I could send you to some cold wet hell.\u201d\nSisterton is hell enough. Davos feared the worst. The Three Sisters were fickle bitches, loyal only to themselves. Supposedly they were sworn to the Arryns of the Vale, but the Eyrie\u2019s grasp upon the islands was tenuous at best.\n\u201cSunderland would require me to hand you over if he knew of you.\u201d Borrell did fealty for Sweetsister, as Longthorpe did for Longsister and Torrent for Littlesister; all were sworn to Triston Sunderland, the Lord of the Three Sisters. \u201cHe\u2019d sell you to the queen for a pot of that Lannister gold. Poor man needs every dragon, with seven sons all determined to be knights.\u201d The lord picked up a wooden spoon and attacked his stew again. \u201cI used to curse the gods who gave me only daughters until I heard Triston bemoaning the cost of destriers. You would be surprised to know how many fish it takes to buy a decent suit of plate and mail.\u201d\nI had seven sons as well, but four are burned and dead. \u201cLord Sunderland is sworn to the Eyrie,\u201d Davos said. \u201cBy rights he should deliver me to Lady Arryn.\u201d He would stand a better chance with her than with the Lannisters, he judged. Though she had taken no part in the War of the Five Kings, Lysa Arryn was a daughter of Riverrun, and aunt to the Young Wolf.\n\u201cLysa Arryn\u2019s dead,\u201d Lord Godric said, \u201cmurdered by some singer. Lord Littlefinger rules the Vale now. Where are the pirates?\u201d When Davos did not answer, he rapped his spoon against the table. \u201cThe Lyseni. Torrent spied their sails from Littlesister, and before him the Flints from Widow\u2019s Watch. Orange sails, and green, and pink. Salladhor Saan. Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cAt sea.\u201d Salla would be sailing around the Fingers and down the narrow sea. He was returning to the Stepstones with what few ships remained him. Perhaps he would acquire a few more along the way, if he came upon some likely merchantmen. A little piracy to help the leagues go by. \u201cHis Grace has sent him south, to trouble the Lannisters and their friends.\u201d The lie was one he had rehearsed as he rowed toward Sisterton through the rain. Soon or late the world would learn that Salladhor Saan had abandoned Stannis Baratheon, leaving him without a fleet, but they would not hear it from the lips of Davos Seaworth.\nLord Godric stirred his stew. \u201cDid that old pirate Saan make you swim to shore?\u201d\n\u201cI came ashore in an open boat, my lord.\u201d Salla had waited until the beacon of the Night Lamp shone off the Valyrian\u2019s port bow before he put him off. Their friendship had been worth that much, at least. The Lyseni would gladly have taken him south with him, he avowed, but Davos had refused. Stannis needed Wyman Manderly, and had trusted Davos to win him. He would not betray that trust, he told Salla. \u201cBah,\u201d the pirate prince replied, \u201che will kill you with these honors, old friend. He will kill you.\u201d\n\u201cI have never had a King\u2019s Hand beneath my roof before,\u201d Lord Godric said. \u201cWould Stannis ransom you, I wonder?\u201d\nWould he? Stannis had given Davos lands and titles and offices, but would he pay good gold to buy back his life? He has no gold. Else he\u2019d still have Salla. \u201cYou will find His Grace at Castle Black if my lord would like to ask that of him.\u201d\nBorrell grunted. \u201cIs the Imp at Castle Black as well?\u201d\n\u201cThe Imp?\u201d Davos did not understand the question. \u201cHe is at King\u2019s Landing, condemned to die for the murder of his nephew.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall is the last to learn, my father used to say. The dwarf\u2019s escaped. He twisted through the bars of his cell and tore his own father apart with his bare hands. A guardsman saw him flee, red from head to heel, as if he\u2019d bathed in blood. The queen will make a lord of any man who kills him.\u201d\nDavos struggled to believe what he was hearing. \u201cYou are telling me that Tywin Lannister is dead?\u201d\n\u201cAt his son\u2019s hand, aye.\u201d The lord took a drink of beer. \u201cWhen there were kings on the Sisters, we did not suffer dwarfs to live. We cast them all into the sea, as an offering to the gods. The septons made us stop that. A pack of pious fools. Why would the gods give a man such a shape but to mark him as a monster?\u201d\nLord Tywin dead. This changes all. \u201cMy lord, will you grant me leave to send a raven to the Wall? His Grace will want to know of Lord Tywin\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll know. But not from me. Nor you, so long as you are here beneath my leaky roof. I\u2019ll not have it said that I gave Stannis aid and counsel. The Sunderlands dragged the Sisters into two of the Blackfyre Rebellions, and we all suffered grievously for that.\u201d Lord Godric waved his spoon toward a chair. \u201cSit. Before you fall, ser. My hall is cold and damp and dark, but not without some courtesy. We\u2019ll find dry clothes for you, but first you\u2019ll eat.\u201d He shouted, and a woman entered the hall. \u201cWe have a guest to feed. Bring beer and bread and sister\u2019s stew.\u201d\nThe beer was brown, the bread black, the stew a creamy white. She served it in a trencher hollowed out of a stale loaf. It was thick with leeks, carrots, barley, and turnips white and yellow, along with clams and chunks of cod and crabmeat, swimming in a stock of heavy cream and butter. It was the sort of stew that warmed a man right down to his bones, just the thing for a wet, cold night. Davos spooned it up gratefully.\n\u201cYou have tasted sister\u2019s stew before?\u201d\n\u201cI have, my lord.\u201d The same stew was served all over the Three Sisters, in every inn and tavern.\n\u201cThis is better than what you\u2019ve had before. Gella makes it. My daughter\u2019s daughter. Are you married, onion knight?\u201d\n\u201cI am, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cA pity. Gella\u2019s not. Homely women make the best wives. There\u2019s three kinds of crabs in there. Red crabs and spider crabs and conquerors. I won\u2019t eat spider crab, except in sister\u2019s stew. Makes me feel half a cannibal.\u201d His lordship gestured at the banner hanging above the cold black hearth. A spider crab was embroidered there, white on a grey-green field. \u201cWe heard tales that Stannis burned his Hand.\u201d\nThe Hand who went before me. Melisandre had given Alester Florent to her god on Dragonstone, to conjure up the wind that bore them north. Lord Florent had been strong and silent as the queen\u2019s men bound him to the post, as dignified as any half-naked man could hope to be, but as the flames licked up his legs he had begun to scream, and his screams had blown them all the way to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, if the red woman could be believed. Davos had misliked that wind. It had seemed to him to smell of burning flesh, and the sound of it was anguished as it played amongst the lines. It could as easily have been me. \u201cI did not burn,\u201d he assured Lord Godric, \u201cthough Eastwatch almost froze me.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall will do that.\u201d The woman brought them a fresh loaf of bread, still hot from the oven. When Davos saw her hand, he stared. Lord Godric did not fail to make note of it. \u201cAye, she has the mark. Like all Borrells, for five thousand years. My daughter\u2019s daughter. Not the one who makes the stew.\u201d He tore the bread apart and offered half to Davos. \u201cEat. It\u2019s good.\u201d\nIt was, though any stale crust would have tasted just as fine to Davos; it meant he was a guest here, for this one night at least. The lords of the Three Sisters had a black repute, and none more so than Godric Borrell, Lord of Sweetsister, Shield of Sisterton, Master of Breakwater Castle, and Keeper of the Night Lamp\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but even robber lords and wreckers were bound by the ancient laws of hospitality. I will see the dawn, at least, Davos told himself. I have eaten of his bread and salt.\nThough there were stranger spices than salt in this sister\u2019s stew. \u201cIs it saffron that I\u2019m tasting?\u201d Saffron was worth more than gold. Davos had only tasted it once before, when King Robert had sent a half a fish to him at a feast on Dragonstone.\n\u201cAye. From Qarth. There\u2019s pepper too.\u201d Lord Godric took a pinch between his thumb and forefinger and sprinkled his own trencher. \u201cCracked black pepper from Volantis, nothing finer. Take as much as you require if you\u2019re feeling peppery. I\u2019ve got forty chests of it. Not to mention cloves and nutmeg, and a pound of saffron. Took it off a sloe-eyed maid.\u201d He laughed. He still had all his teeth, Davos saw, though most of them were yellow and one on the top was black and dead. \u201cShe was making for Braavos, but a gale swept her into the Bite and she smashed up against some of my rocks. So you see, you are not the only gift the storms have brought me. The sea\u2019s a treacherous cruel thing.\u201d\nNot as treacherous as men, thought Davos. Lord Godric\u2019s forebears had been pirate kings until the Starks came down on them with fire and sword. These days the Sistermen left open piracy to Salladhor Saan and his ilk and confined themselves to wrecking. The beacons that burned along the shores of the Three Sisters were supposed to warn of shoals and reefs and rocks and lead the way to safety, but on stormy nights and foggy ones, some Sistermen would use false lights to draw unwary captains to their doom.\n\u201cThe storms did you a kindness, blowing you to my door,\u201d Lord Godric said. \u201cYou\u2019d have found a cold welcome in White Harbor. You come too late, ser. Lord Wyman means to bend his knee, and not to Stannis.\u201d He took a swallow of his beer. \u201cThe Manderlys are no northmen, not down deep. \u2019Twas no more than nine hundred years ago when they came north, laden down with all their gold and gods. They\u2019d been great lords on the Mander until they overreached themselves and the green hands slapped them down. The wolf king took their gold, but he gave them land and let them keep their gods.\u201d He mopped at his stew with a chunk of bread. \u201cIf Stannis thinks the fat man will ride the stag, he\u2019s wrong. The Lionstar put in at Sisterton twelve days ago to fill her water casks. Do you know her? Crimson sails and a gold lion on her prow. And full of Freys, making for White Harbor.\u201d\n\u201cFreys?\u201d That was the last thing that Davos would have expected. \u201cThe Freys killed Lord Wyman\u2019s son, we heard.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d Lord Godric said, \u201cand the fat man was so wroth that he took a vow to live on bread and wine till he had his vengeance. But before the day was out, he was stuffing clams and cakes into his mouth again. There\u2019s ships that go between the Sisters and White Harbor all the time. We sell them crabs and fish and goat cheese, they sell us wood and wool and hides. From all I hear, his lordship\u2019s fatter than ever. So much for vows. Words are wind, and the wind from Manderly\u2019s mouth means no more than the wind escaping out his bottom.\u201d The lord tore off another chunk of bread to swipe out his trencher. \u201cThe Freys were bringing the fat fool a bag of bones. Some call that courtesy, to bring a man his dead son\u2019s bones. Had it been my son, I would have returned the courtesy and thanked the Freys before I hanged them, but the fat man\u2019s too noble for that.\u201d He stuffed the bread into his mouth, chewed, swallowed. \u201cI had the Freys to supper. One sat just where you\u2019re sitting now. Rhaegar, he named himself. I almost laughed right in his face. He\u2019d lost his wife, he said, but he meant to get himself a new one in White Harbor. Ravens have been flying back and forth. Lord Wyman and Lord Walder have made a pact, and mean to seal it with a marriage.\u201d\nDavos felt as though the lord had punched him in the belly. If he tells it true, my king is lost. Stannis Baratheon had desperate need of White Harbor. If Winterfell was the heart of the north, White Harbor was its mouth. Its firth had remained free of ice even in the depths of winter for centuries. With winter coming on, that could mean much and more. So could the city\u2019s silver. The Lannisters had all the gold of Casterly Rock, and had wed the wealth of Highgarden. King Stannis\u2019s coffers were exhausted. I must try, at least. There may be some way that I can stop this marriage. \u201cI have to reach White Harbor,\u201d he said. \u201cYour lordship, I beg you, help me.\u201d\nLord Godric began to eat his trencher, tearing it apart in his big hands. The stew had softened the stale bread. \u201cI have no love for northmen,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe maesters say the Rape of the Three Sisters was two thousand years ago, but Sisterton has not forgotten. We were a free people before that, with our kings ruling over us. Afterward, we had to bend our knees to the Eyrie to get the northmen out. The wolf and the falcon fought over us for a thousand years, till between the two of them they had gnawed all the fat and flesh off the bones of these poor islands. As for your King Stannis, when he was Robert\u2019s master of ships he sent a fleet into my port without my leave and made me hang a dozen fine friends. Men like you. He went so far as to threaten to hang me if it should happen that some ship went aground because the Night Lamp had gone black. I had to eat his arrogance.\u201d He ate some of the trencher. \u201cNow he comes north humbled, with his tail between his legs. Why should I give him any aid? Answer me that.\u201d\nBecause he is your rightful king, Davos thought. Because he is a strong man and a just one, the only man who can restore the realm and defend it against the peril that gathers in the north. Because he has a magic sword that glows with the light of the sun. The words caught in his throat. None of them would sway the Lord of Sweetsister. None of them would get him a foot closer to White Harbor. What answer does he want? Must I promise him gold we do not have? A highborn husband for his daughter\u2019s daughter? Lands, honors, titles? Lord Alester Florent had tried to play that game, and the king had burned him for it.\n\u201cThe Hand has lost his tongue, it seems. He has no taste for sister\u2019s stew, or truth.\u201d Lord Godric wiped his mouth.\n\u201cThe lion is dead,\u201d said Davos, slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s your truth, my lord. Tywin Lannister is dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he is?\u201d\n\u201cWho rules now in King\u2019s Landing? Not Tommen, he is just a child. Is it Ser Kevan?\u201d\nCandlelight gleamed in Lord Godric\u2019s black eyes. \u201cIf it were, you\u2019d be in chains. It\u2019s the queen who rules.\u201d\nDavos understood. He nurses doubts. He does not want to find himself upon the losing side. \u201cStannis held Storm\u2019s End against the Tyrells and the Redwynes. He took Dragonstone from the last Targaryens. He smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle. This child king will not prevail against him.\u201d\n\u201cThis child king commands the wealth of Casterly Rock and the power of Highgarden. He has the Boltons and the Freys.\u201d Lord Godric rubbed his chin. \u201cStill\u00a0\u2026\u00a0in this world only winter is certain. Ned Stark told my father that, here in this very hall.\u201d\n\u201cNed Stark was here?\u201d\n\u201cAt the dawn of Robert\u2019s Rebellion. The Mad King had sent to the Eyrie for Stark\u2019s head, but Jon Arryn sent him back defiance. Gulltown stayed loyal to the throne, though. To get home and call his banners, Stark had to cross the mountains to the Fingers and find a fisherman to carry him across the Bite. A storm caught them on the way. The fisherman drowned, but his daughter got Stark to the Sisters before the boat went down. They say he left her with a bag of silver and a bastard in her belly. Jon Snow, she named him, after Arryn.\n\u201cBe that as it may. My father sat where I sit now when Lord Eddard came to Sisterton. Our maester urged us to send Stark\u2019s head to Aerys, to prove our loyalty. It would have meant a rich reward. The Mad King was open-handed with them as pleased him. By then we knew that Jon Arryn had taken Gulltown, though. Robert was the first man to gain the wall, and slew Marq Grafton with his own hand. \u2018This Baratheon is fearless,\u2019 I said. \u2018He fights the way a king should fight.\u2019 Our maester chuckled at me and told us that Prince Rhaegar was certain to defeat this rebel. That was when Stark said, \u2018In this world only winter is certain. We may lose our heads, it\u2019s true\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but what if we prevail?\u2019 My father sent him on his way with his head still on his shoulders. \u2018If you lose,\u2019 he told Lord Eddard, \u2018you were never here.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cNo more than I was,\u201d said Davos Seaworth.",

      "content": "JON\nThey brought forth the King-Beyond-the-Wall with his hands bound by hempen rope and a noose around his neck.\nThe other end of the rope was looped about the saddle horn of Ser Godry Farring\u2019s courser. The Giantslayer and his mount were armored in silvered steel inlaid with niello. Mance Rayder wore only a thin tunic that left his limbs naked to the cold. They could have let him keep his cloak, Jon Snow thought, the one the wildling woman patched with strips of crimson silk.\nSmall wonder that the Wall was weeping.\n\u201cMance knows the haunted forest better than any ranger,\u201d Jon had told King Stannis, in his final effort to convince His Grace that the King-Beyond-the-Wall would be of more use to them alive than dead. \u201cHe knows Tormund Giantsbane. He has fought the Others. And he had the Horn of Joramun and did not blow it. He did not bring down the Wall when he could have.\u201d\nHis words fell on deaf ears. Stannis had remained unmoved. The law was plain; a deserter\u2019s life was forfeit.\nBeneath the weeping Wall, Lady Melisandre raised her pale white hands. \u201cWe all must choose,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cMan or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same.\u201d Her voice made Jon Snow think of anise and nutmeg and cloves. She stood at the king\u2019s side on a wooden scaffold raised above the pit. \u201cWe choose light or we choose darkness. We choose good or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.\u201d\nMance Rayder\u2019s thick grey-brown hair blew about his face as he walked. He pushed it from his eyes with bound hands, smiling. But when he saw the cage, his courage failed him. The queen\u2019s men had made it from the trees of the haunted forest, from saplings and supple branches, pine boughs sticky with sap, and the bone-white fingers of the weirwoods. They\u2019d bent them and twisted them around and through each other to weave a wooden lattice, then hung it high above a deep pit filled with logs, leaves, and kindling.\nThe wildling king recoiled from the sight. \u201cNo,\u201d he cried, \u201cmercy. This is not right, I\u2019m not the king, they\u2014\u201d\nSer Godry gave a pull on the rope. The King-Beyond-the-Wall had no choice but to stumble after him, the rope choking off his words. When he lost his feet, Godry dragged him the rest of the way. Mance was bloody when the queen\u2019s men half-shoved, half-carried him to the cage. A dozen men-at-arms heaved together to hoist him into the air.\nLady Melisandre watched him rise. \u201cFREE FOLK! Here stands your king of lies. And here is the horn he promised would bring down the Wall.\u201d Two queen\u2019s men brought forth the Horn of Joramun, black and banded with old gold, eight feet long from end to end. Runes were carved into the golden bands, the writing of the First Men. Joramun had died thousands of years ago, but Mance had found his grave beneath a glacier, high up in the Frostfangs. And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter, and woke giants from the earth. Ygritte had told Jon that Mance never found the horn. She lied, or else Mance kept it secret even from his own.\nA thousand captives watched through the wooden bars of their stockade as the horn was lifted high. All were ragged and half-starved. Wildlings, the Seven Kingdoms called them; they named themselves the free folk. They looked neither wild nor free\u2014only hungry, frightened, numb.\n\u201cThe Horn of Joramun?\u201d Melisandre said. \u201cNo. Call it the Horn of Darkness. If the Wall falls, night falls as well, the long night that never ends. It must not happen, will not happen! The Lord of Light has seen his children in their peril and sent a champion to them, Azor Ahai reborn.\u201d She swept a hand toward Stannis, and the great ruby at her throat pulsed with light.\nHe is stone and she is flame. The king\u2019s eyes were blue bruises, sunk deep in a hollow face. He wore grey plate, a fur-trimmed cloak of cloth-of-gold flowing from his broad shoulders. His breastplate had a flaming heart inlaid above his own. Girding his brows was a red-gold crown with points like twisting flames. Val stood beside him, tall and fair. They had crowned her with a simple circlet of dark bronze, yet she looked more regal in bronze than Stannis did in gold. Her eyes were grey and fearless, unflinching. Beneath an ermine cloak, she wore white and gold. Her honey-blond hair had been done up in a thick braid that hung over her right shoulder to her waist. The chill in the air had put color in her cheeks.\nLady Melisandre wore no crown, but every man there knew that she was Stannis Baratheon\u2019s real queen, not the homely woman he had left to shiver at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Talk was, the king did not mean to send for Queen Selyse and their daughter until the Nightfort was ready for habitation. Jon felt sorry for them. The Wall offered few of the comforts that southron ladies and little highborn girls were used to, and the Nightfort offered none. That was a grim place, even at the best of times.\n\u201cFREE FOLK!\u201d cried Melisandre. \u201cBehold the fate of those who choose the darkness!\u201d\nThe Horn of Joramun burst into flame.\nIt went up with a whoosh as swirling tongues of green and yellow fire leapt up crackling all along its length. Jon\u2019s garron shied nervously, and up and down the ranks others fought to still their mounts as well. A moan came from the stockade as the free folk saw their hope afire. A few began to shout and curse, but most lapsed into silence. For half a heartbeat the runes graven on the gold bands seemed to shimmer in the air. The queen\u2019s men gave a heave and sent the horn tumbling down into the fire pit.\nInside his cage, Mance Rayder clawed at the noose about his neck with bound hands and screamed incoherently of treachery and witchery, denying his kingship, denying his people, denying his name, denying all that he had ever been. He shrieked for mercy and cursed the red woman and began to laugh hysterically.\nJon watched unblinking. He dare not appear squeamish before his brothers. He had ordered out two hundred men, more than half the garrison of Castle Black. Mounted in solemn sable ranks with tall spears in hand, they had drawn up their hoods to shadow their faces\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and hide the fact that so many were greybeards and green boys. The free folk feared the Watch. Jon wanted them to take that fear with them to their new homes south of the Wall.\nThe horn crashed amongst the logs and leaves and kindling. Within three heartbeats the whole pit was aflame. Clutching the bars of his cage with bound hands, Mance sobbed and begged. When the fire reached him he did a little dance. His screams became one long, wordless shriek of fear and pain. Within his cage, he fluttered like a burning leaf, a moth caught in a candle flame.\nJon found himself remembering a song.",

      "content": "Val stood on the platform as still as if she had been carved of salt. She will not weep nor look away. Jon wondered what Ygritte would have done in her place. The women are the strong ones. He found himself thinking about Sam and Maester Aemon, about Gilly and the babe. She will curse me with her dying breath, but I saw no other way. Eastwatch reported savage storms upon the narrow sea. I meant to keep them safe. Did I feed them to the crabs instead? Last night he had dreamed of Sam drowning, of Ygritte dying with his arrow in her (it had not been his arrow, but in his dreams it always was), of Gilly weeping tears of blood.\nJon Snow had seen enough. \u201cNow,\u201d he said.\nUlmer of the Kingswood jammed his spear into the ground, unslung his bow, and slipped a black arrow from his quiver. Sweet Donnel Hill threw back his hood to do the same. Garth Greyfeather and Bearded Ben nocked shafts, bent their bows, loosed.\nOne arrow took Mance Rayder in the chest, one in the gut, one in the throat. The fourth struck one of the cage\u2019s wooden bars, and quivered for an instant before catching fire. A woman\u2019s sobs echoed off the Wall as the wildling king slid bonelessly to the floor of his cage, wreathed in fire. \u201cAnd now his Watch is done,\u201d Jon murmured softly. Mance Rayder had been a man of the Night\u2019s Watch once, before he changed his black cloak for one slashed with bright red silk.\nUp on the platform, Stannis was scowling. Jon refused to meet his eyes. The bottom had fallen out of the wooden cage, and its bars were crumbling. Every time the fire licked upward, more branches tumbled free, cherry red and black. \u201cThe Lord of Light made the sun and moon and stars to light our way, and gave us fire to keep the night at bay,\u201d Melisandre told the wildlings. \u201cNone can withstand his flames.\u201d\n\u201cNone can withstand his flames,\u201d the queen\u2019s men echoed.\nThe red woman\u2019s robes of deep-dyed scarlet swirled about her, and her coppery hair made a halo round her face. Tall yellow flames danced from her fingertips like claws. \u201cFREE FOLK! Your false gods cannot help you. Your false horn did not save you. Your false king brought you only death, despair, defeat\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but here stands the true king. BEHOLD HIS GLORY!\u201d\nStannis Baratheon drew Lightbringer.\nThe sword glowed red and yellow and orange, alive with light. Jon had seen the show before\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not like this, never before like this. Lightbringer was the sun made steel. When Stannis raised the blade above his head, men had to turn their heads or cover their eyes. Horses shied, and one threw his rider. The blaze in the fire pit seemed to shrink before this storm of light, like a small dog cowering before a larger one. The Wall itself turned red and pink and orange, as waves of color danced across the ice. Is this the power of king\u2019s blood?\n\u201cWesteros has but one king,\u201d said Stannis. His voice rang harsh, with none of Melisandre\u2019s music. \u201cWith this sword I defend my subjects and destroy those who menace them. Bend the knee, and I promise you food, land, and justice. Kneel and live. Or go and die. The choice is yours.\u201d He slipped Lightbringer into its scabbard, and the world darkened once again, as if the sun had gone behind a cloud. \u201cOpen the gates.\u201d\n\u201cOPEN THE GATES,\u201d bellowed Ser Clayton Suggs, in a voice as deep as a warhorn. \u201cOPEN THE GATES,\u201d echoed Ser Corliss Penny, commanding the guards. \u201cOPEN THE GATES,\u201d cried the serjeants. Men scrambled to obey. Sharpened stakes were wrenched from the ground, planks were dropped across deep ditches, and the stockade gates were thrown wide. Jon Snow raised his hand and lowered it, and his black ranks parted right and left, clearing a path to the Wall, where Dolorous Edd Tollett pushed open the iron gate.\n\u201cCome,\u201d urged Melisandre. \u201cCome to the light\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or run back to the darkness.\u201d In the pit below her, the fire was crackling. \u201cIf you choose life, come to me.\u201d\nAnd they came. Slowly at first, some limping or leaning on their fellows, the captives began to emerge from their rough-hewn pen. If you would eat, come to me, Jon thought. If you would not freeze or starve, submit. Hesitant, wary of some trap, the first few prisoners edged across the planks and through the ring of the stakes, toward Melisandre and the Wall. More followed, when they saw that no harm had come to those who went before. Then more, until it was a steady stream. Queen\u2019s men in studded jacks and halfhelms handed each passing man, woman, or child a piece of white weirwood: a stick, a splintered branch as pale as broken bone, a spray of blood-red leaves. A piece of the old gods to feed the new. Jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand.\nThe heat from the fire pit was palpable even at a distance; for the wildlings, it had to be blistering. He saw men cringing as they neared the flames, heard children cry. A few turned for the forest. He watched a young woman stumble away with a child on either hand. Every few steps she looked back to make certain no one was coming after them, and when she neared the trees she broke into a run. One greybeard took the weirwood branch they handed him and used it as a weapon, laying about with it until the queen\u2019s men converged on him with spears. The others had to step around his body, until Ser Corliss had it thrown in the fire. More of the free folk chose the woods after that\u2014one in ten, perhaps.\nBut most came on. Behind them was only cold and death. Ahead was hope. They came on, clutching their scraps of wood until the time came to feed them to the flames. R\u2019hllor was a jealous deity, ever hungry. So the new god devoured the corpse of the old, and cast gigantic shadows of Stannis and Melisandre upon the Wall, black against the ruddy red reflections on the ice.\nSigorn was the first to kneel before the king. The new Magnar of Thenn was a younger, shorter version of his father\u2014lean, balding, clad in bronze greaves and a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales. Next came Rattleshirt in clattering armor made of bones and boiled leather, his helm a giant\u2019s skull. Under the bones lurked a ruined and wretched creature with cracked brown teeth and a yellow tinge to the whites of his eyes. A small, malicious, treacherous man, as stupid as he is cruel. Jon did not believe for a moment that he would keep faith. He wondered what Val was feeling as she watched him kneel, forgiven.\nLesser leaders followed. Two clan chiefs of the Hornfoot men, whose feet were black and hard. An old wisewoman revered by the peoples of the Milkwater. A scrawny dark-eyed boy of two-and-ten, the son of Alfyn Crowkiller. Halleck, brother to Harma Dogshead, with her pigs. Each took a knee before the king.\nIt is too cold for this mummer\u2019s show, thought Jon. \u201cThe free folk despise kneelers,\u201d he had warned Stannis. \u201cLet them keep their pride, and they will love you better.\u201d His Grace would not listen. He said, \u201cIt is swords I need from them, not kisses.\u201d\nHaving knelt, the wildlings shuffled past the ranks of the black brothers to the gate. Jon had detailed Horse and Satin and half a dozen others to lead them through the Wall with torches. On the far side, bowls of hot onion soup awaited them, and chunks of black bread and sausage. Clothes as well: cloaks, breeches, boots, tunics, good leather gloves. They would sleep on piles of clean straw, with fires blazing to keep the chill of night at bay. This king was nothing if not methodical. Soon or late, however, Tormund Giantsbane would assault the Wall again, and when that hour came Jon wondered whose side Stannis\u2019s new-made subjects would choose. You can give them land and mercy, but the free folk choose their own kings, and it was Mance they chose, not you.\nBowen Marsh edged his mount up next to Jon\u2019s. \u201cThis is a day I never thought to see.\u201d The Lord Steward had thinned notably since suffering a head wound at the Bridge of Skulls. Part of one ear was gone. He no longer looks much like a pomegranate, Jon thought. Marsh said, \u201cWe bled to stop the wildlings at the Gorge. Good men were slain there, friends and brothers. For what?\u201d\n\u201cThe realm will curse us all for this,\u201d declared Ser Alliser Thorne in a venomous tone. \u201cEvery honest man in Westeros will turn his head and spit at the mention of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\nWhat would you know of honest men? \u201cQuiet in the ranks.\u201d Ser Alliser had grown more circumspect since Lord Janos had lost his head, but the malice was still there. Jon had toyed with the idea of giving him the command Slynt had refused, but he wanted the man close. He was always the more dangerous of the two. Instead he had dispatched a grizzled steward from the Shadow Tower to take command at Greyguard.\nHe hoped the two new garrisons would make a difference. The Watch can make the free folk bleed, but in the end we cannot hope to stop them. Giving Mance Rayder to the fire did not change the truth of that. We are still too few and they are still too many, and without rangers, we\u2019re good as blind. I have to send men out. But if I do, will they come back again?\nThe tunnel through the Wall was narrow and twisting, and many of the wildlings were old or ill or wounded, so the going was painfully slow. By the time the last of them had bent the knee, night had fallen. The pit fire was burning low, and the king\u2019s shadow on the Wall had shrunk to a quarter of its former height. Jon Snow could see his breath in the air. Cold, he thought, and getting colder. This mummer\u2019s show has gone on long enough.\nTwo score captives lingered by the stockade. Four giants were among them, massive hairy creatures with sloped shoulders, legs as large as tree trunks, and huge splayed feet. Big as they were, they might still have passed through the Wall, but one would not leave his mammoth, and the others would not leave him. The rest of those who remained were all of human stature. Some were dead and some were dying; more were their kin or close companions, unwilling to abandon them even for a bowl of onion soup.\nSome shivering, some too numb to shiver, they listened as the king\u2019s voice rumbled off the Wall. \u201cYou are free to go,\u201d Stannis told them. \u201cTell your people what you witnessed. Tell them that you saw the true king, and that they are welcome in his realm, so long as they keep his peace. Elsewise, they had best flee or hide. I will brook no further attacks upon my Wall.\u201d\n\u201cOne realm, one god, one king!\u201d cried Lady Melisandre.\nThe queen\u2019s men took up the cry, beating the butts of their spears against their shields. \u201cOne realm, one god, one king! STANNIS! STANNIS! ONE REALM, ONE GOD, ONE KING!\u201d\nVal did not join the chant, he saw. Nor did the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch. During the tumult the few remaining wildlings melted into the trees. The giants were the last to go, two riding on the back of a mammoth, the other two afoot. Only the dead were left behind. Jon watched Stannis descend from the platform, with Melisandre by his side. His red shadow. She never leaves his side for long. The king\u2019s honor guard fell in around them\u2014Ser Godry, Ser Clayton, and a dozen other knights, queen\u2019s men all. Moonlight shimmered on their armor and the wind whipped at their cloaks. \u201cLord Steward,\u201d Jon told Marsh, \u201cbreak up that stockade for firewood and throw the corpses in the flames.\u201d\n\u201cAs my lord commands.\u201d Marsh barked out orders, and a swarm of his stewards broke from ranks to attack the wooden walls. The Lord Steward watched them, frowning. \u201cThese wildlings\u00a0\u2026\u00a0do you think they will keep faith, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cSome will. Not all. We have our cowards and our knaves, our weaklings and our fools, as do they.\u201d\n\u201cOur vows\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we are sworn to protect the realm\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOnce the free folk are settled in the Gift, they will become part of the realm,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cThese are desperate days, and like to grow more desperate. We have seen the face of our real foe, a dead white face with bright blue eyes. The free folk have seen that face as well. Stannis is not wrong in this. We must make common cause with the wildlings.\u201d\n\u201cCommon cause against a common foe, I could agree with that,\u201d said Bowen Marsh, \u201cbut that does not mean we should allow tens of thousands of half-starved savages through the Wall. Let them return to their villages and fight the Others there, whilst we seal the gates. It will not be difficult, Othell tells me. We need only fill the tunnels with chunks of stone and pour water through the murder holes. The Wall does the rest. The cold, the weight\u00a0\u2026\u00a0in a moon\u2019s turn, it will be as if no gate had ever been. Any foe would need to hack his way through.\u201d\n\u201cOr climb.\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cThese are not raiders, out to steal a wife and some plunder. Tormund will have old women with him, children, herds of sheep and goats, even mammoths. He needs a gate, and only three of those remain. And if he should send climbers up, well, defending against climbers is as simple as spearing fish in a kettle.\u201d\nFish never climb out of the kettle and shove a spear through your belly. Jon had climbed the Wall himself.\nMarsh went on. \u201cMance Rayder\u2019s bowmen must have loosed ten thousand arrows at us, judging from the number of spent shafts we\u2019ve gathered up. Fewer than a hundred reached our men atop the Wall, most of those lifted by some errant gust of wind. Red Alyn of the Rosewood was the only man to die up there, and it was his fall that killed him, not the arrow that pricked his leg. Donal Noye died to hold the gate. A gallant act, yes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if the gate had been sealed, our brave armorer might still be with us. Whether we face a hundred foes or a hundred thousand, so long as we\u2019re atop the Wall and they\u2019re below, they cannot do us harm.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not wrong. Mance Rayder\u2019s host had broken against the Wall like a wave upon a stony shore, though the defenders were no more than a handful of old men, green boys, and cripples. Yet what Bowen was suggesting went against all of Jon\u2019s instincts. \u201cIf we seal the gates, we cannot send out rangers,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe will be as good as blind.\u201d\n\u201cLord Mormont\u2019s last ranging cost the Watch a quarter of its men, my lord. We need to conserve what strength remains us. Every death diminishes us, and we are stretched so thin\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Take the high ground and win the battle, my uncle used to say. No ground is higher than the Wall, Lord Commander.\u201d\n\u201cStannis promises land, food, and justice to any wildlings who bend the knee. He will never permit us to seal the gates.\u201d\nMarsh hesitated. \u201cLord Snow, I am not one to bear tales, but there has been talk that you are becoming too\u00a0\u2026\u00a0too friendly with Lord Stannis. Some even suggest that you are\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nA rebel and a turncloak, aye, and a bastard and a warg as well. Janos Slynt might be gone, but his lies lingered. \u201cI know what they say.\u201d Jon had heard the whispers, had seen men turn away when he crossed the yard. \u201cWhat would they have me do, take up swords against Stannis and the wildlings both? His Grace has thrice the fighting men we do, and is our guest besides. The laws of hospitality protect him. And we owe him and his a debt.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis helped us when we needed help,\u201d Marsh said doggedly, \u201cbut he is still a rebel, and his cause is doomed. As doomed as we\u2019ll be if the Iron Throne marks us down as traitors. We must be certain that we do not choose the losing side.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not my intent to choose any side,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut I am not as certain of the outcome of this war as you seem to be, my lord. Not with Lord Tywin dead.\u201d If the tales coming up the kingsroad could be believed, the King\u2019s Hand had been murdered by his dwarf son whilst sitting on a privy. Jon had known Tyrion Lannister, briefly. He took my hand and named me friend. It was hard to believe the little man had it in him to murder his own sire, but the fact of Lord Tywin\u2019s demise seemed to be beyond doubt. \u201cThe lion in King\u2019s Landing is a cub, and the Iron Throne has been known to cut grown men to ribbons.\u201d\n\u201cA boy he may be, my lord, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0King Robert was well loved, and most men still accept that Tommen is his son. The more they see of Lord Stannis the less they love him, and fewer still are fond of Lady Melisandre with her fires and this grim red god of hers. They complain.\u201d\n\u201cThey complained about Lord Commander Mormont too. Men love to complain about their wives and lords, he told me once. Those without wives complain twice as much about their lords.\u201d Jon Snow glanced toward the stockade. Two walls were down, a third falling fast. \u201cI will leave you to finish here, Bowen. Make certain every corpse is burned. Thank you for your counsel. I promise you, I will think on all you\u2019ve said.\u201d\nSmoke and drifting ash still lingered in the air about the pit as Jon trotted back to the gate. There he dismounted, to walk his garron through the ice to the south side. Dolorous Edd went before him with a torch. Its flames licked the ceiling, so cold tears trickled down upon them with every step.\n\u201cIt was a relief to see that horn burn, my lord,\u201d Edd said. \u201cJust last night I dreamt I was pissing off the Wall when someone decided to give the horn a toot. Not that I\u2019m complaining. It was better than my old dream, where Harma Dogshead was feeding me to her pigs.\u201d\n\u201cHarma\u2019s dead,\u201d Jon said.\n\u201cBut not the pigs. They look at me the way Slayer used to look at ham. Not to say that the wildlings mean us harm. Aye, we hacked their gods apart and made them burn the pieces, but we gave them onion soup. What\u2019s a god compared to a nice bowl of onion soup? I could do with one myself.\u201d\nThe odors of smoke and burned flesh still clung to Jon\u2019s blacks. He knew he had to eat, but it was company he craved, not food. A cup of wine with Maester Aemon, some quiet words with Sam, a few laughs with Pyp and Grenn and Toad. Aemon and Sam were gone, though, and his other friends\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cI will take supper with the men this evening.\u201d\n\u201cBoiled beef and beets.\u201d Dolorous Edd always seemed to know what was cooking. \u201cHobb says he\u2019s out of horseradish, though. What good is boiled beef without horseradish?\u201d\nSince the wildlings had burned the old common hall, the men of the Night\u2019s Watch took their meals in the stone cellar below the armory, a cavernous space divided by two rows of square stone pillars, with barrel-vaulted ceilings and great casks of wine and ale along the walls. When Jon entered, four builders were playing at tiles at the table nearest the steps. Closer to the fire sat a group of rangers and a few king\u2019s men, talking quietly.\nThe younger men were gathered at another table, where Pyp had stabbed a turnip with his knife. \u201cThe night is dark and full of turnips,\u201d he announced in a solemn voice. \u201cLet us all pray for venison, my children, with some onions and a bit of tasty gravy.\u201d His friends laughed\u2014Grenn, Toad, Satin, the whole lot of them.\nJon Snow did not join the laughter. \u201cMaking mock of another man\u2019s prayer is fool\u2019s work, Pyp. And dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cIf the red god\u2019s offended, let him strike me down.\u201d\nAll the smiles had died. \u201cIt was the priestess we were laughing at,\u201d said Satin, a lithe and pretty youth who had once been a whore in Oldtown. \u201cWe were only having a jape, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your gods and she has hers. Leave her be.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t let our gods be,\u201d argued Toad. \u201cShe calls the Seven false gods, m\u2019lord. The old gods too. She made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. You saw.\u201d\n\u201cLady Melisandre is not part of my command. You are. I won\u2019t have bad blood between the king\u2019s men and my own.\u201d\nPyp laid a hand on Toad\u2019s arm. \u201cCroak no more, brave Toad, for our Great Lord Snow has spoken.\u201d Pyp hopped to his feet and gave Jon a mocking bow. \u201cI beg pardon. Henceforth, I shall not even waggle my ears save by your lordship\u2019s lordly leave.\u201d\nHe thinks this is all some game. Jon wanted to shake some sense into him. \u201cWaggle your ears all you like. It\u2019s your tongue waggling that makes the trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that he\u2019s more careful,\u201d Grenn promised, \u201cand I\u2019ll clout him if he\u2019s not.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cMy lord, will you sup with us? Owen, shove over and make room for Jon.\u201d\nJon wanted nothing more. No, he had to tell himself, those days are gone. The realization twisted in his belly like a knife. They had chosen him to rule. The Wall was his, and their lives were his as well. A lord may love the men that he commands, he could hear his lord father saying, but he cannot be a friend to them. One day he may need to sit in judgment on them, or send them forth to die. \u201cAnother day,\u201d the lord commander lied. \u201cEdd, best see to your own supper. I have work to finish.\u201d\nThe outside air seemed even colder than before. Across the castle, he could see candlelight shining from the windows of the King\u2019s Tower. Val stood on the tower roof, gazing up at the Wall. Stannis kept her closely penned in rooms above his own, but he did allow her to walk the battlements for exercise. She looks lonely, Jon thought. Lonely, and lovely. Ygritte had been pretty in her own way, with her red hair kissed by fire, but it was her smile that made her face come alive. Val did not need to smile; she would have turned men\u2019s heads in any court in the wide world.\nAll the same, the wildling princess was not beloved of her gaolers. She scorned them all as \u201ckneelers,\u201d and had thrice attempted to escape. When one man-at-arms grew careless in her presence she had snatched his dagger from its sheath and stabbed him in the neck. Another inch to the left and he might have died.\nLonely and lovely and lethal, Jon Snow reflected, and I might have had her. Her, and Winterfell, and my lord father\u2019s name. Instead he had chosen a black cloak and a wall of ice. Instead he had chosen honor. A bastard\u2019s sort of honor.\nThe Wall loomed on his right as he crossed the yard. Its high ice glimmered palely, but down below all was shadow. At the gate a dim orange glow shone through the bars where the guards had taken refuge from the wind. Jon could hear the creak of chains as the winch cage swung and scraped against the ice. Up top, the sentries would be huddling in the warming shed around a brazier, shouting to be heard above the wind. Or else they would have given up the effort, and each man would be sunk in his own pool of silence. I should be walking the ice. The Wall is mine.\nHe was walking beneath the shell of the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower, past the spot where Ygritte had died in his arms, when Ghost appeared beside him, his warm breath steaming in the cold. In the moonlight, his red eyes glowed like pools of fire. The taste of hot blood filled Jon\u2019s mouth, and he knew that Ghost had killed that night. No, he thought. I am a man, not a wolf. He rubbed his mouth with the back of a gloved hand and spat.\nClydas still occupied the rooms beneath the rookery. At Jon\u2019s knock, he came shuffling, a taper in his hand, to open the door a crack. \u201cDo I intrude?\u201d asked Jon.\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Clydas opened the door wider. \u201cI was mulling wine. Will my lord take a cup?\u201d\n\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d His hands were stiff from cold. He pulled off his gloves and flexed his fingers.\nClydas returned to the hearth to stir the wine. He\u2019s sixty if he\u2019s a day. An old man. He only seemed young compared with Aemon. Short and round, he had the dim pink eyes of some nocturnal creature. A few white hairs clung to his scalp. When Clydas poured, Jon held the cup with both hands, sniffed the spices, swallowed. The warmth spread through his chest. He drank again, long and deep, to wash the taste of blood from his mouth.\n\u201cThe queen\u2019s men are saying that the King-Beyond-the-Wall died craven. That he cried for mercy and denied he was a king.\u201d\n\u201cHe did. Lightbringer was brighter than I\u2019d ever seen it. As bright as the sun.\u201d Jon raised his cup. \u201cTo Stannis Baratheon and his magic sword.\u201d The wine was bitter in his mouth.\n\u201cHis Grace is not an easy man. Few are, who wear a crown. Many good men have been bad kings, Maester Aemon used to say, and some bad men have been good kings.\u201d\n\u201cHe would know.\u201d Aemon Targaryen had seen nine kings upon the Iron Throne. He had been a king\u2019s son, a king\u2019s brother, a king\u2019s uncle. \u201cI looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife\u2019s blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot. Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.\u201d\nClydas blinked. \u201cA sword that makes its own heat\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0would be a fine thing on the Wall.\u201d Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. \u201cA pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold. I\u2019ll be curious to see how his Lightbringer behaves in battle. Thank you for the wine. Ghost, with me.\u201d Jon Snow raised the hood of his cloak and pulled at the door. The white wolf followed him back into the night.\nThe armory was dark and silent. Jon nodded to the guards before making his way past the silent racks of spears to his rooms. He hung his sword belt from a peg beside the door and his cloak from another. When he peeled off his gloves, his hands were stiff and cold. It took him a long while to get the candles lit. Ghost curled up on his rug and went to sleep, but Jon could not rest yet. The scarred pinewood table was covered with maps of the Wall and the lands beyond, a roster of rangers, and a letter from the Shadow Tower written in Ser Denys Mallister\u2019s flowing hand.\nHe read the letter from the Shadow Tower again, sharpened a quill, and unstoppered a pot of thick black ink. He wrote two letters, the first to Ser Denys, the second to Cotter Pyke. Both of them had been hounding him for more men. Halder and Toad he dispatched west to the Shadow Tower, Grenn and Pyp to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. The ink would not flow properly, and all his words seemed curt and crude and clumsy, yet he persisted.\nWhen he finally put the quill down, the room was dim and chilly, and he could feel its walls closing in. Perched above the window, the Old Bear\u2019s raven peered down at him with shrewd black eyes. My last friend, Jon thought ruefully. And I had best outlive you, or you\u2019ll eat my face as well. Ghost did not count. Ghost was closer than a friend. Ghost was part of him.\nJon rose and climbed the steps to the narrow bed that had once been Donal Noye\u2019s. This is my lot, he realized as he undressed, from now until the end of my days.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nWhat is it?\u201d she cried, as Irri shook her gently by the shoulder. It was the black of night outside. Something is wrong, she knew at once. \u201cIs it Daario? What\u2019s happened?\u201d In her dream they had been man and wife, simple folk who lived a simple life in a tall stone house with a red door. In her dream he had been kissing her all over\u2014her mouth, her neck, her breasts.\n\u201cNo, Khaleesi,\u201d Irri murmured, \u201cit is your eunuch Grey Worm and the bald men. Will you see them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Her hair was disheveled and her bedclothes all atangle, Dany realized. \u201cHelp me dress. I\u2019ll have a cup of wine as well. To clear my head.\u201d To drown my dream. She could hear the soft sounds of sobs. \u201cWho is that weeping?\u201d\n\u201cYour slave Missandei.\u201d Jhiqui had a taper in her hand.\n\u201cMy servant. I have no slaves.\u201d Dany did not understand. \u201cWhy does she weep?\u201d\n\u201cFor him who was her brother,\u201d Irri told her.\nThe rest she had from Skahaz, Reznak, and Grey Worm, when they were ushered into her presence. Dany knew their tidings were bad before a word was spoken. One glance at the Shavepate\u2019s ugly face sufficed to tell her that. \u201cThe Sons of the Harpy?\u201d\nSkahaz nodded. His mouth was grim.\n\u201cHow many dead?\u201d\nReznak wrung his hands. \u201cN-nine, Magnificence. Foul work it was, and wicked. A dreadful night, dreadful.\u201d\nNine. The word was a dagger in her heart. Every night the shadow war was waged anew beneath the stepped pyramids of Meereen. Every morn the sun rose upon fresh corpses, with harpies drawn in blood on the bricks beside them. Any freedman who became too prosperous or too outspoken was marked for death. Nine in one night, though\u00a0\u2026 That frightened her. \u201cTell me.\u201d\nGrey Worm answered. \u201cYour servants were set upon as they walked the bricks of Meereen to keep Your Grace\u2019s peace. All were well armed, with spears and shields and short swords. Two by two they walked, and two by two they died. Your servants Black Fist and Cetherys were slain by crossbow bolts in Mazdhan\u2019s Maze. Your servants Mossador and Duran were crushed by falling stones beneath the river wall. Your servants Eladon Goldenhair and Loyal Spear were poisoned at a wineshop where they were accustomed to stop each night upon their rounds.\u201d\nMossador. Dany made a fist. Missandei and her brothers had been taken from their home on Naath by raiders from the Basilisk Isles and sold into slavery in Astapor. Young as she was, Missandei had shown such a gift for tongues that the Good Masters had made a scribe of her. Mossador and Marselen had not been so fortunate. They had been gelded and made into Unsullied. \u201cHave any of the murderers been captured?\u201d\n\u201cYour servants have arrested the owner of the wineshop and his daughters. They plead their ignorance and beg for mercy.\u201d\nThey all plead ignorance and beg for mercy. \u201cGive them to the Shavepate. Skahaz, keep each apart from the others and put them to the question.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be done, Your Worship. Would you have me question them sweetly, or sharply?\u201d\n\u201cSweetly, to begin. Hear what tales they tell and what names they give you. It may be they had no part in this.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cNine, the noble Reznak said. Who else?\u201d\n\u201cThree freedmen, murdered in their homes,\u201d the Shavepate said. \u201cA moneylender, a cobbler, and the harpist Rylona Rhee. They cut her fingers off before they killed her.\u201d\nThe queen flinched. Rylona Rhee had played the harp as sweetly as the Maiden. When she had been a slave in Yunkai, she had played for every highborn family in the city. In Meereen she had become a leader amongst the Yunkish freedmen, their voice in Dany\u2019s councils. \u201cWe have no captives but this wineseller?\u201d\n\u201cNone, this one grieves to confess. We beg your pardon.\u201d\nMercy, thought Dany. They will have the dragon\u2019s mercy. \u201cSkahaz, I have changed my mind. Question the man sharply.\u201d\n\u201cI could. Or I could question the daughters sharply whilst the father looks on. That will wring some names from him.\u201d\n\u201cDo as you think best, but bring me names.\u201d Her fury was a fire in her belly. \u201cI will have no more Unsullied slaughtered. Grey Worm, pull your men back to their barracks. Henceforth let them guard my walls and gates and person. From this day, it shall be for Meereenese to keep the peace in Meereen. Skahaz, make me a new watch, made up in equal parts of shavepates and freedmen.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command. How many men?\u201d\n\u201cAs many as you require.\u201d\nReznak mo Reznak gasped. \u201cMagnificence, where is the coin to come from to pay wages for so many men?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the pyramids. Call it a blood tax. I will have a hundred pieces of gold from every pyramid for each freedman that the Harpy\u2019s Sons have slain.\u201d\nThat brought a smile to the Shavepate\u2019s face. \u201cIt will be done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Your Radiance should know that the Great Masters of Zhak and Merreq are making preparations to quit their pyramids and leave the city.\u201d\nDaenerys was sick unto death of Zhak and Merreq; she was sick of all the Mereenese, great and small alike. \u201cLet them go, but see that they take no more than the clothes upon their backs. Make certain that all their gold remains here with us. Their stores of food as well.\u201d\n\u201cMagnificence,\u201d murmured Reznak mo Reznak, \u201cwe cannot know that these great nobles mean to join your enemies. More like they are simply making for their estates in the hills.\u201d\n\u201cThey will not mind us keeping their gold safe, then. There is nothing to buy in the hills.\u201d\n\u201cThey are afraid for their children,\u201d Reznak said.\nYes, Daenerys thought, and so am I. \u201cWe must keep them safe as well. I will have two children from each of them. From the other pyramids as well. A boy and a girl.\u201d\n\u201cHostages,\u201d said Skahaz, happily.\n\u201cPages and cupbearers. If the Great Masters make objection, explain to them that in Westeros it is a great honor for a child to be chosen to serve at court.\u201d She left the rest unspoken. \u201cGo and do as I\u2019ve commanded. I have my dead to mourn.\u201d\nWhen she returned to her rooms atop the pyramid, she found Missandei crying softly on her pallet, trying as best she could to muffle the sound of her sobs. \u201cCome sleep with me,\u201d she told the little scribe. \u201cDawn will not come for hours yet.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace is kind to this one.\u201d Missandei slipped under the sheets. \u201cHe was a good brother.\u201d\nDany wrapped her arms about the girl. \u201cTell me of him.\u201d\n\u201cHe taught me how to climb a tree when we were little. He could catch fish with his hands. Once I found him sleeping in our garden with a hundred butterflies crawling over him. He looked so beautiful that morning, this one\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I mean, I loved him.\u201d\n\u201cAs he loved you.\u201d Dany stroked the girl\u2019s hair. \u201cSay the word, my sweet, and I will send you from this awful place. I will find a ship somehow and send you home. To Naath.\u201d\n\u201cI would sooner stay with you. On Naath I\u2019d be afraid. What if the slavers came again? I feel safe when I\u2019m with you.\u201d\nSafe. The word made Dany\u2019s eyes fill up with tears. \u201cI want to keep you safe.\u201d Missandei was only a child. With her, she felt as if she could be a child too. \u201cNo one ever kept me safe when I was little. Well, Ser Willem did, but then he died, and Viserys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want to protect you but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it is so hard. To be strong. I don\u2019t always know what I should do. I must know, though. I am all they have. I am the queen\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0mother,\u201d whispered Missandei.\n\u201cMother to dragons.\u201d Dany shivered.\n\u201cNo. Mother to us all.\u201d Missandei hugged her tighter. \u201cYour Grace should sleep. Dawn will be here soon, and court.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll both sleep, and dream of sweeter days. Close your eyes.\u201d When she did, Dany kissed her eyelids and made her giggle.\nKisses came easier than sleep, however. Dany shut her eyes and tried to think of home, of Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and all the other places that Viserys had told her of, in a kinder land than this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but her thoughts kept turning back to Slaver\u2019s Bay, like ships caught in some bitter wind. When Missandei was sound asleep, Dany slipped from her arms and stepped out into the predawn air to lean upon the cool brick parapet and gaze out across the city. A thousand roofs stretched out below her, painted in shades of ivory and silver by the moon.\nSomewhere beneath those roofs, the Sons of the Harpy were gathered, plotting ways to kill her and all those who loved her and put her children back in chains. Somewhere down there a hungry child was crying for milk. Somewhere an old woman lay dying. Somewhere a man and a maid embraced, and fumbled at each other\u2019s clothes with eager hands. But up here there was only the sheen of moonlight on pyramids and pits, with no hint what lay beneath. Up here there was only her, alone.\nShe was the blood of the dragon. She could kill the Sons of the Harpy, and the sons of the sons, and the sons of the sons of the sons. But a dragon could not feed a hungry child nor help a dying woman\u2019s pain. And who would ever dare to love a dragon?\nShe found herself thinking of Daario Naharis once again, Daario with his gold tooth and trident beard, his strong hands resting on the hilts of his matched arakh and stiletto, hilts wrought of gold in the shape of naked women. The day he took his leave of her, as she was bidding him farewell, he had brushed the balls of his thumbs lightly across them, back and forth. I am jealous of a sword hilt, she had realized, of women made of gold. Sending him to the Lamb Men had been wise. She was a queen, and Daario Naharis was not the stuff of kings.\n\u201cIt has been so long,\u201d she had said to Ser Barristan, just yesterday. \u201cWhat if Daario has betrayed me and gone over to my enemies?\u201d Three treasons will you know. \u201cWhat if he met another woman, some princess of the Lhazarene?\u201d\nThe old knight neither liked nor trusted Daario, she knew. Even so, he had answered gallantly. \u201cThere is no woman more lovely than Your Grace. Only a blind man could believe otherwise, and Daario Naharis was not blind.\u201d\nNo, she thought. His eyes are a deep blue, almost purple, and his gold tooth gleams when he smiles for me.\nSer Barristan was sure he would return, though. Dany could only pray that he was right.\nA bath will help soothe me. She padded barefoot through the grass to her terrace pool. The water felt cool on her skin, raising goosebumps. Little fish nibbled at her arms and legs. She closed her eyes and floated.\nA soft rustle made her open them again. She sat up with a soft splash. \u201cMissandei?\u201d she called. \u201cIrri? Jhiqui?\u201d\n\u201cThey sleep,\u201d came the answer.\nA woman stood under the persimmon tree, clad in a hooded robe that brushed the grass. Beneath the hood, her face seemed hard and shiny. She is wearing a mask, Dany knew, a wooden mask finished in dark red lacquer. \u201cQuaithe? Am I dreaming?\u201d She pinched her ear and winced at the pain. \u201cI dreamt of you on Balerion, when first we came to Astapor.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not dream. Then or now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? How did you get past my guards?\u201d\n\u201cI came another way. Your guards never saw me.\u201d\n\u201cIf I call out, they will kill you.\u201d\n\u201cThey will swear to you that I am not here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you here?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun\u2019s son and the mummer\u2019s dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d\n\u201cReznak? Why should I fear him?\u201d Dany rose from the pool. Water trickled down her legs, and gooseflesh covered her arms in the cool night air. \u201cIf you have some warning for me, speak plainly. What do you want of me, Quaithe?\u201d\nMoonlight shone in the woman\u2019s eyes. \u201cTo show you the way.\u201d\n\u201cI remember the way. I go north to go south, east to go west, back to go forward. And to touch the light I have to pass beneath the shadow.\u201d She squeezed the water from her silvery hair. \u201cI am half-sick of riddling. In Qarth I was a beggar, but here I am a queen. I command you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDaenerys. Remember the Undying. Remember who you are.\u201d\n\u201cThe blood of the dragon.\u201d But my dragons are roaring in the darkness. \u201cI remember the Undying. Child of three, they called me. Three mounts they promised me, three fires, and three treasons. One for blood and one for gold and one for\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Missandei stood in the door of the queen\u2019s bedchamber, a lantern in her hand. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\nDany glanced back toward the persimmon tree. There was no woman there. No hooded robe, no lacquer mask, no Quaithe.\nA shadow. A memory. No one. She was the blood of the dragon, but Ser Barristan had warned her that in that blood there was a taint. Could I be going mad? They had called her father mad, once. \u201cI was praying,\u201d she told the Naathi girl. \u201cIt will be light soon. I had best eat something, before court.\u201d\n\u201cI will bring you food to break your fast.\u201d\nAlone again, Dany went all the way around the pyramid in hopes of finding Quaithe, past the burned trees and scorched earth where her men had tried to capture Drogon. But the only sound was the wind in the fruit trees, and the only creatures in the gardens were a few pale moths.\nMissandei returned with a melon and a bowl of hard-cooked eggs, but Dany found she had no appetite. As the sky lightened and the stars faded one by one, Irri and Jhiqui helped her don a tokar of violet silk fringed in gold.\nWhen Reznak and Skahaz appeared, she found herself looking at them askance, mindful of the three treasons. Beware the perfumed seneschal. She sniffed suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak. I could command the Shavepate to arrest him and put him to the question. Would that forestall the prophecy? Or would some other betrayer take his place? Prophecies are treacherous, she reminded herself, and Reznak may be no more than he appears.\nIn the purple hall, Dany found her ebon bench piled high about with satin pillows. The sight brought a wan smile to her lips. Ser Barristan\u2019s work, she knew. The old knight was a good man, but sometimes very literal. It was only a jape, ser, she thought, but she sat on one of the pillows just the same.\nHer sleepless night soon made itself felt. Before long she was fighting off a yawn as Reznak prattled about the craftsmen\u2019s guilds. The stonemasons were wroth with her, it seemed. The bricklayers as well. Certain former slaves were carving stone and laying bricks, stealing work from guild journeymen and masters alike. \u201cThe freedmen work too cheaply, Magnificence,\u201d Reznak said. \u201cSome call themselves journeymen, or even masters, titles that belong by rights only to the craftsmen of the guilds. The masons and the bricklayers do respectfully petition Your Worship to uphold their ancient rights and customs.\u201d\n\u201cThe freedmen work cheaply because they are hungry,\u201d Dany pointed out. \u201cIf I forbid them to carve stone or lay bricks, the chandlers, the weavers, and the goldsmiths will soon be at my gates asking that they be excluded from those trades as well.\u201d She considered a moment. \u201cLet it be written that henceforth only guild members shall be permitted to name themselves journeymen or masters\u00a0\u2026\u00a0provided the guilds open their rolls to any freedman who can demonstrate the requisite skills.\u201d\n\u201cSo shall it be proclaimed,\u201d said Reznak. \u201cWill it please Your Worship to hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?\u201d\nWill he never admit defeat? \u201cLet him step forth.\u201d\nHizdahr was not in a tokar today. Instead he wore a simple robe of grey and blue. He was shorn as well. He has shaved off his beard and cut his hair, she realized. The man had not gone shavepate, not quite, but at least those absurd wings of his were gone. \u201cYour barber has served you well, Hizdahr. I hope you have come to show me his work and not to plague me further about the fighting pits.\u201d\nHe made a deep obeisance. \u201cYour Grace, I fear I must.\u201d\nDany grimaced. Even her own people would give no rest about the matter. Reznak mo Reznak stressed the coin to be made through taxes. The Green Grace said that reopening the pits would please the gods. The Shavepate felt it would win her support against the Sons of the Harpy. \u201cLet them fight,\u201d grunted Strong Belwas, who had once been a champion in the pits. Ser Barristan suggested a tourney instead; his orphans could ride at rings and fight a m\u00eal\u00e9e with blunted weapons, he said, a suggestion Dany knew was as hopeless as it was well-intentioned. It was blood the Meereenese yearned to see, not skill. Elsewise the fighting slaves would have worn armor. Only the little scribe Missandei seemed to share the queen\u2019s misgivings.\n\u201cI have refused you six times,\u201d Dany reminded Hizdahr.\n\u201cYour Radiance has seven gods, so perhaps she will look upon my seventh plea with favor. Today I do not come alone. Will you hear my friends? There are seven of them as well.\u201d He brought them forth one by one. \u201cHere is Khrazz. Here Barsena Blackhair, ever valiant. Here Camarron of the Count and Goghor the Giant. This is the Spotted Cat, this Fearless Ithoke. Last, Belaquo Bonebreaker. They have come to add their voices to mine own, and ask Your Grace to let our fighting pits reopen.\u201d\nDany knew his seven, by name if not by sight. All had been amongst the most famed of Meereen\u2019s fighting slaves\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and it had been the fighting slaves, freed from their shackles by her sewer rats, who led the uprising that won the city for her. She owed them a blood debt. \u201cI will hear you,\u201d she allowed.\nOne by one, each of them asked her to let the fighting pits reopen. \u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded, when Ithoke had finished. \u201cYou are no longer slaves, doomed to die at a master\u2019s whim. I freed you. Why should you wish to end your lives upon the scarlet sands?\u201d\n\u201cI train since three,\u201d said Goghor the Giant. \u201cI kill since six. Mother of Dragons says I am free. Why not free to fight?\u201d\n\u201cIf it is fighting you want, fight for me. Swear your sword to the Mother\u2019s Men or the Free Brothers or the Stalwart Shields. Teach my other freedmen how to fight.\u201d\nGoghor shook his head. \u201cBefore, I fight for master. You say, fight for you. I say, fight for me.\u201d The huge man thumped his chest with a fist as big as a ham. \u201cFor gold. For glory.\u201d\n\u201cGoghor speaks for us all.\u201d The Spotted Cat wore a leopard skin across one shoulder. \u201cThe last time I was sold, the price was three hundred thousand honors. When I was a slave, I slept on furs and ate red meat off the bone. Now that I\u2019m free, I sleep on straw and eat salt fish, when I can get it.\u201d\n\u201cHizdahr swears that the winners shall share half of all the coin collected at the gates,\u201d said Khrazz. \u201cHalf, he swears it, and Hizdahr is an honorable man.\u201d\nNo, a cunning man. Daenerys felt trapped. \u201cAnd the losers? What shall they receive?\u201d\n\u201cTheir names shall be graven on the Gates of Fate amongst the other valiant fallen,\u201d declared Barsena. For eight years she had slain every other woman sent against her, it was said. \u201cAll men must die, and women too\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not all will be remembered.\u201d\nDany had no answer for that. If this is truly what my people wish, do I have the right to deny it to them? It was their city before it was mine, and it is their own lives they wish to squander. \u201cI will consider all you\u2019ve said. Thank you for your counsel.\u201d She rose. \u201cWe will resume on the morrow.\u201d\n\u201cAll kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons,\u201d Missandei called.\nSer Barristan escorted her back up to her chambers. \u201cTell me a tale, ser,\u201d Dany said as they climbed. \u201cSome tale of valor with a happy ending.\u201d She felt in need of happy endings. \u201cTell me how you escaped from the Usurper.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace. There is no valor in running for your life.\u201d\nDany seated herself on a cushion, crossed her legs, and gazed up at him. \u201cPlease. It was the Young Usurper who dismissed you from the Kingsguard\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey, aye. They gave my age for a reason, though the truth was elsewise. The boy wanted a white cloak for his dog Sandor Clegane and his mother wanted the Kingslayer to be her lord commander. When they told me, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I took off my cloak as they commanded, threw my sword at Joffrey\u2019s feet, and spoke unwisely.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but truth was never welcome at that court. I walked from the throne room with my head high, though I did not know where I was going. I had no home but White Sword Tower. My cousins would find a place for me at Harvest Hall, I knew, but I had no wish to bring Joffrey\u2019s displeasure down upon them. I was gathering my things when it came to me that I had brought this on myself by taking Robert\u2019s pardon. He was a good knight but a bad king, for he had no right to the throne he sat. That was when I knew that to redeem myself I must find the true king, and serve him loyally with all the strength that still remained me.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother Viserys.\u201d\n\u201cSuch was my intent. When I reached the stables the gold cloaks tried to seize me. Joffrey had offered me a tower to die in, but I had spurned his gift, so now he meant to offer me a dungeon. The commander of the City Watch himself confronted me, emboldened by my empty scabbard, but he had only three men with him and I still had my knife. I slashed one man\u2019s face open when he laid his hands upon me, and rode through the others. As I spurred for the gates I heard Janos Slynt shouting for them to go after me. Once outside the Red Keep, the streets were congested, else I might have gotten away clean. Instead they caught me at the River Gate. The gold cloaks who had pursued me from the castle shouted for those at the gate to stop me, so they crossed their spears to bar my way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you without your sword? How did you get past them?\u201d\n\u201cA true knight is worth ten guardsmen. The men at the gate were taken by surprise. I rode one down, wrenched away his spear, and drove it through the throat of my closest pursuer. The other broke off once I was through the gate, so I spurred my horse to a gallop and rode hellbent along the river until the city was lost to sight behind me. That night I traded my horse for a handful of pennies and some rags, and the next morning I joined the stream of smallfolk making their way to King\u2019s Landing. I\u2019d gone out the Mud Gate, so I returned through the Gate of the Gods, with dirt on my face, stubble on my cheeks, and no weapon but a wooden staff. In roughspun clothes and mud-caked boots, I was just one more old man fleeing the war. The gold cloaks took a stag from me and waved me through. King\u2019s Landing was crowded with smallfolk who\u2019d come seeking refuge from the fighting. I lost myself amongst them. I had a little silver, but I needed that to pay my passage across the narrow sea, so I slept in septs and alleys and took my meals in pot shops. I let my beard grow out and cloaked myself in age. The day Lord Stark lost his head, I was there, watching. Afterward I went into the Great Sept and thanked the seven gods that Joffrey had stripped me of my cloak.\u201d\n\u201cStark was a traitor who met a traitor\u2019s end.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Selmy, \u201cEddard Stark played a part in your father\u2019s fall, but he bore you no ill will. When the eunuch Varys told us that you were with child, Robert wanted you killed, but Lord Stark spoke against it. Rather than countenance the murder of children, he told Robert to find himself another Hand.\u201d\n\u201cHave you forgotten Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon?\u201d\n\u201cNever. That was Lannister work, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cLannister or Stark, what difference? Viserys used to call them the Usurper\u2019s dogs. If a child is set upon by a pack of hounds, does it matter which one tears out his throat? All the dogs are just as guilty. The guilt\u00a0\u2026\u201d The word caught in her throat. Hazzea, she thought, and suddenly she heard herself say, \u201cI have to see the pit,\u201d in a voice as small as a child\u2019s whisper. \u201cTake me down, ser, if you would.\u201d\nA flicker of disapproval crossed the old man\u2019s face, but it was not his way to question his queen. \u201cAs you command.\u201d\nThe servants\u2019 steps were the quickest way down\u2014not grand, but steep and straight and narrow, hidden in the walls. Ser Barristan brought a lantern, lest she fall. Bricks of twenty different colors pressed close around them, fading to grey and black beyond the lantern light. Thrice they passed Unsullied guards, standing as if they had been carved from stone. The only sound was the soft scruff of their feet upon the steps.\nAt ground level the Great Pyramid of Meereen was a hushed place, full of dust and shadows. Its outer walls were thirty feet thick. Within them, sounds echoed off arches of many-colored bricks, and amongst the stables, stalls, and storerooms. They passed beneath three massive arches, down a torchlit ramp into the vaults beneath the pyramid, past cisterns, dungeons, and torture chambers where slaves had been scourged and skinned and burned with red-hot irons. Finally they came to a pair of huge iron doors with rusted hinges, guarded by Unsullied.\nAt her command, one produced an iron key. The door opened, hinges shrieking. Daenerys Targaryen stepped into the hot heart of darkness and stopped at the lip of a deep pit. Forty feet below, her dragons raised their heads. Four eyes burned through the shadows\u2014two of molten gold and two of bronze.\nSer Barristan took her by the arm. \u201cNo closer.\u201d\n\u201cYou think they would harm me?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know, Your Grace, but I would sooner not risk your person to learn the answer.\u201d\nWhen Rhaegal roared, a gout of yellow flame turned darkness into day for half a heartbeat. The fire licked along the walls, and Dany felt the heat upon her face, like the blast from an oven. Across the pit, Viserion\u2019s wings unfolded, stirring the stale air. He tried to fly to her, but the chains snapped taut as he rose and slammed him down onto his belly. Links as big as a man\u2019s fist bound his feet to the floor. The iron collar about his neck was fastened to the wall behind him. Rhaegal wore matching chains. In the light of Selmy\u2019s lantern, his scales gleamed like jade. Smoke rose from between his teeth. Bones were scattered on the floor at his feet, cracked and scorched and splintered. The air was uncomfortably hot and smelled of sulfur and charred meat.\n\u201cThey are larger.\u201d Dany\u2019s voice echoed off the scorched stone walls. A drop of sweat trickled down her brow and fell onto her breast. \u201cIs it true that dragons never stop growing?\u201d\n\u201cIf they have food enough, and space to grow. Chained up in here, though\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe Great Masters had used the pit as a prison. It was large enough to hold five hundred men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and more than ample for two dragons. For how long, though? What will happen when they grow too large for the pit? Will they turn on one another with flame and claw? Will they grow wan and weak, with withered flanks and shrunken wings? Will their fires go out before the end?\nWhat sort of mother lets her children rot in darkness?\nIf I look back, I am doomed, Dany told herself\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but how could she not look back? I should have seen it coming. Was I so blind, or did I close my eyes willfully, so I would not have to see the price of power?\nViserys had told her all the tales when she was little. He loved to talk of dragons. She knew how Harrenhal had fallen. She knew about the Field of Fire and the Dance of the Dragons. One of her forebears, the third Aegon, had seen his own mother devoured by his uncle\u2019s dragon. And there were songs beyond count of villages and kingdoms that lived in dread of dragons till some brave dragonslayer rescued them. At Astapor the slaver\u2019s eyes had melted. On the road to Yunkai, when Daario tossed the heads of Sallor the Bald and Prendahl na Ghezn at her feet, her children made a feast of them. Dragons had no fear of men. And a dragon large enough to gorge on sheep could take a child just as easily.\nHer name had been Hazzea. She was four years old. Unless her father lied. He might have lied. No one had seen the dragon but him. His proof was burned bones, but burned bones proved nothing. He might have killed the little girl himself, and burned her afterward. He would not have been the first father to dispose of an unwanted girl child, the Shavepate claimed. The Sons of the Harpy might have done it, and made it look like dragon\u2019s work to make the city hate me. Dany wanted to believe that\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if that was so, why had Hazzea\u2019s father waited until the audience hall was almost empty to come forward? If his purpose had been to inflame the Meereenese against her, he would have told his tale when the hall was full of ears to hear.\nThe Shavepate had urged her to put the man to death. \u201cAt least rip out his tongue. This man\u2019s lie could destroy us all, Magnificence.\u201d Instead Dany chose to pay the blood price. No one could tell her the worth of a daughter, so she set it at one hundred times the worth of a lamb. \u201cI would give Hazzea back to you if I could,\u201d she told the father, \u201cbut some things are beyond the power of even a queen. Her bones shall be laid to rest in the Temple of the Graces, and a hundred candles shall burn day and night in her memory. Come back to me each year upon her nameday, and your other children shall not want\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but this tale must never pass your lips again.\u201d\n\u201cMen will ask,\u201d the grieving father had said. \u201cThey will ask me where Hazzea is and how she died.\u201d\n\u201cShe died of a snakebite,\u201d Reznak mo Reznak insisted. \u201cA ravening wolf carried her off. A sudden sickness took her. Tell them what you will, but never speak of dragons.\u201d\nViserion\u2019s claws scrabbled against the stones, and the huge chains rattled as he tried to make his way to her again. When he could not, he gave a roar, twisted his head back as far as he was able, and spat golden flame at the wall behind him. How soon till his fire burns hot enough to crack stone and melt iron?\nOnce, not long ago, he had ridden on her shoulder, his tail coiled round her arm. Once she had fed him morsels of charred meat from her own hand. He had been the first chained up. Daenerys had led him to the pit herself and shut him up inside with several oxen. Once he had gorged himself he grew drowsy. They had chained him whilst he slept.\nRhaegal had been harder. Perhaps he could hear his brother raging in the pit, despite the walls of brick and stone between them. In the end, they had to cover him with a net of heavy iron chain as he basked on her terrace, and he fought so fiercely that it had taken three days to carry him down the servants\u2019 steps, twisting and snapping. Six men had been burned in the struggle.\nAnd Drogon\u00a0\u2026\nThe winged shadow, the grieving father called him. He was the largest of her three, the fiercest, the wildest, with scales as black as night and eyes like pits of fire.\nDrogon hunted far afield, but when he was sated he liked to bask in the sun at the apex of the Great Pyramid, where once the harpy of Meereen had stood. Thrice they had tried to take him there, and thrice they had failed. Two score of her bravest had risked themselves trying to capture him. Almost all had suffered burns, and four of them had died. The last she had seen of Drogon had been at sunset on the night of the third attempt. The black dragon had been flying north across the Skahazadhan toward the tall grasses of the Dothraki sea. He had not returned.\nMother of dragons, Daenerys thought. Mother of monsters. What have I unleashed upon the world? A queen I am, but my throne is made of burned bones, and it rests on quicksand. Without dragons, how could she hope to hold Meereen, much less win back Westeros? I am the blood of the dragon, she thought. If they are monsters, so am I.",

      "content": "REEK\nThe rat squealed as he bit into it, squirming wildly in his hands, frantic to escape. The belly was the softest part. He tore at the sweet meat, the warm blood running over his lips. It was so good that it brought tears to his eyes. His belly rumbled and he swallowed. By the third bite the rat had ceased to struggle, and he was feeling almost content.\nThen he heard the sounds of voices outside the dungeon door.\nAt once he stilled, fearing even to chew. His mouth was full of blood and flesh and hair, but he dare not spit or swallow. He listened in terror, stiff as stone, to the scuff of boots and the clanking of iron keys. No, he thought, no, please gods, not now, not now. It had taken him so long to catch the rat. If they catch me with it, they will take it away, and then they\u2019ll tell, and Lord Ramsay will hurt me.\nHe knew he ought to hide the rat, but he was so hungry. It had been two days since he had eaten, or maybe three. Down here in the dark it was hard to tell. Though his arms and legs were thin as reeds, his belly was swollen and hollow, and ached so much that he found he could not sleep. Whenever he closed his eyes, he found himself remembering Lady Hornwood. After their wedding, Lord Ramsay had locked her away in a tower and starved her to death. In the end she had eaten her own fingers.\nHe crouched down in a corner of his cell, clutching his prize under his chin. Blood ran from the corners of his mouth as he nibbled at the rat with what remained of his teeth, trying to bolt down as much of the warm flesh as he could before the cell was opened. The meat was stringy, but so rich he thought he might be sick. He chewed and swallowed, picking small bones from the holes in his gums where teeth had been yanked out. It hurt to chew, but he was so hungry he could not stop.\nThe sounds were growing louder. Please gods, he isn\u2019t coming for me, he prayed, tearing off one of the rat\u2019s legs. It had been a long time since anyone had come for him. There were other cells, other prisoners. Sometimes he heard them screaming, even through the thick stone walls. The women always scream the loudest. He sucked at the raw meat and tried to spit out the leg bone, but it only dribbled over his lower lip and tangled in his beard. Go away, he prayed, go away, pass me by, please, please.\nBut the footsteps stopped just when they were loudest, and the keys clattered right outside the door. The rat fell from his fingers. He wiped his bloody fingers on his breeches. \u201cNo,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cnoooo.\u201d His heels scrabbled at the straw as he tried to push himself into the corner, into the cold damp stone walls.\nThe sound of the lock turning was the most terrible of all. When the light hit him full in the face, he let out a shriek. He had to cover his eyes with his hands. He would have clawed them out if he\u2019d dared, his head was pounding so. \u201cTake it away, do it in the dark, please, oh please.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not him,\u201d said a boy\u2019s voice. \u201cLook at him. We\u2019ve got the wrong cell.\u201d\n\u201cLast cell on the left,\u201d another boy replied. \u201cThis is the last cell on the left, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d A pause. \u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he likes the light.\u201d\n\u201cWould you, if you looked like that?\u201d The boy hawked and spat. \u201cAnd the stench of him. I\u2019m like to choke.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been eating rats,\u201d said the second boy. \u201cLook.\u201d\nThe first boy laughed. \u201cHe has. That\u2019s funny.\u201d\nI had to. The rats bit him when he slept, gnawing at his fingers and his toes, even at his face, so when he got his hands on one he did not hesitate. Eat or be eaten, those were the only choices. \u201cI did it,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cI did, I did, I ate him, they do the same to me, please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe boys moved closer, the straw crunching softly under their feet. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d said one of them. He was the smaller of the two, a thin boy, but clever. \u201cDo you remember who you are?\u201d\nThe fear came bubbling up inside him, and he moaned.\n\u201cTalk to me. Tell me your name.\u201d\nMy name. A scream caught in his throat. They had taught him his name, they had, they had, but it had been so long that he\u2019d forgotten. If I say it wrong, he\u2019ll take another finger, or worse, he\u2019ll\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019ll\u00a0\u2026 He would not think about that, he could not think about that. There were needles in his jaw, in his eyes. His head was pounding. \u201cPlease,\u201d he squeaked, his voice thin and weak. He sounded a hundred years old. Perhaps he was. How long have I been in here? \u201cGo,\u201d he mumbled, through broken teeth and broken fingers, his eyes closed tight against the terrible bright light. \u201cPlease, you can have the rat, don\u2019t hurt me\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cReek,\u201d said the larger of the boys. \u201cYour name is Reek. Remember?\u201d He was the one with the torch. The smaller boy had the ring of iron keys.\nReek? Tears ran down his cheeks. \u201cI remember. I do.\u201d His mouth opened and closed. \u201cMy name is Reek. It rhymes with leek.\u201d In the dark he did not need a name, so it was easy to forget. Reek, Reek, my name is Reek. He had not been born with that name. In another life he had been someone else, but here and now, his name was Reek. He remembered.\nHe remembered the boys as well. They were clad in matching lambswool doublets, silver-grey with dark blue trim. Both were squires, both were eight, and both were Walder Frey. Big Walder and Little Walder, yes. Only the big one was Little and the little one was Big, which amused the boys and confused the rest of the world. \u201cI know you,\u201d he whispered, through cracked lips. \u201cI know your names.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re to come with us,\u201d said Little Walder.\n\u201cHis lordship has need of you,\u201d said Big Walder.\nFear went through him like a knife. They are only children, he thought. Two boys of eight. He could overcome two boys of eight, surely. Even as weak as he was, he could take the torch, take the keys, take the dagger sheathed on Little Walder\u2019s hip, escape. No. No, it is too easy. It is a trap. If I run, he will take another finger from me, he will take more of my teeth.\nHe had run before. Years ago, it seemed, when he still had some strength in him, when he had still been defiant. That time it had been Kyra with the keys. She told him she had stolen them, that she knew a postern gate that was never guarded. \u201cTake me back to Winterfell, m\u2019lord,\u201d she begged, pale-faced and trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t know the way. I can\u2019t escape alone. Come with me, please.\u201d And so he had. The gaoler was dead drunk in a puddle of wine, with his breeches down around his ankles. The dungeon door was open and the postern gate had been unguarded, just as she had said. They waited for the moon to go behind a cloud, then slipped from the castle and splashed across the Weeping Water, stumbling over stones, half-frozen by the icy stream. On the far side, he had kissed her. \u201cYou\u2019ve saved us,\u201d he said. Fool. Fool.\nIt had all been a trap, a game, a jape. Lord Ramsay loved the chase and preferred to hunt two-legged prey. All night they ran through the darkling wood, but as the sun came up the sound of a distant horn came faintly through the trees, and they heard the baying of a pack of hounds. \u201cWe should split up,\u201d he told Kyra as the dogs drew closer. \u201cThey cannot track us both.\u201d The girl was crazed with fear, though, and refused to leave his side, even when he swore that he would raise a host of ironborn and come back for her if she should be the one they followed.\nWithin the hour, they were taken. One dog knocked him to the ground, and a second bit Kyra on the leg as she scrambled up a hillside. The rest surrounded them, baying and snarling, snapping at them every time they moved, holding them there until Ramsay Snow rode up with his huntsmen. He was still a bastard then, not yet a Bolton. \u201cThere you are,\u201d he said, smiling down at them from the saddle. \u201cYou wound me, wandering off like this. Have you grown tired of my hospitality so soon?\u201d That was when Kyra seized a stone and threw it at his head. It missed by a good foot, and Ramsay smiled. \u201cYou must be punished.\u201d\nReek remembered the desperate, frightened look in Kyra\u2019s eyes. She had never looked so young as she did in that moment, still half a girl, but there was nothing he could do. She brought them down on us, he thought. If we had separated as I wanted, one of us might have gotten away.\nThe memory made it hard to breathe. Reek turned away from the torch with tears glimmering in his eyes. What does he want of me this time? he thought, despairing. Why won\u2019t he just leave me be? I did no wrong, not this time, why won\u2019t they just leave me in the dark? He\u2019d had a rat, a fat one, warm and wriggling\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cShould we wash him?\u201d asked Little Walder.\n\u201cHis lordship likes him stinky,\u201d said Big Walder. \u201cThat\u2019s why he named him Reek.\u201d\nReek. My name is Reek, it rhymes with bleak. He had to remember that. Serve and obey and remember who you are, and no more harm will come to you. He promised, his lordship promised. Even if he had wanted to resist, he did not have the strength. It had been scourged from him, starved from him, flayed from him. When Little Walder pulled him up and Big Walder waved the torch at him to herd him from the cell, he went along as docile as a dog. If he\u2019d had a tail, he would have tucked it down between his legs.\nIf I had a tail, the Bastard would have cut it off. The thought came unbidden, a vile thought, dangerous. His lordship was not a bastard anymore. Bolton, not Snow. The boy king on the Iron Throne had made Lord Ramsay legitimate, giving him the right to use his lord father\u2019s name. Calling him Snow reminded him of his bastardy and sent him into a black rage. Reek must remember that. And his name, he must remember his name. For half a heartbeat it eluded him, and that frightened him so badly that he tripped on the steep dungeon steps and tore his breeches open on the stone, drawing blood. Little Walder had to shove the torch at him to get him back on his feet and moving again.\nOut in the yard, night was settling over the Dreadfort and a full moon was rising over the castle\u2019s eastern walls. Its pale light cast the shadows of the tall triangular merlons across the frozen ground, a line of sharp black teeth. The air was cold and damp and full of half-forgotten smells. The world, Reek told himself, this is what the world smells like. He did not know how long he had been down there in the dungeons, but it had to have been half a year at least. That long, or longer. What if it has been five years, or ten, or twenty? Would I even know? What if I went mad down there, and half my life is gone? But no, that was folly. It could not have been so long. The boys were still boys. If it had been ten years, they would have grown into men. He had to remember that. I must not let him drive me mad. He can take my fingers and my toes, he can put out my eyes and slice my ears off, but he cannot take my wits unless I let him.\nLittle Walder led the way with torch in hand. Reek followed meekly, with Big Walder just behind him. The dogs in the kennels barked as they went by. Wind swirled through the yard, cutting through the thin cloth of the filthy rags he wore and raising gooseprickles on his skin. The night air was cold and damp, but he saw no sign of snow though surely winter was close at hand. Reek wondered if he would be alive to see the snows come. How many fingers will I have? How many toes? When he raised a hand, he was shocked to see how white it was, how fleshless. Skin and bones, he thought. I have an old man\u2019s hands. Could he have been wrong about the boys? What if they were not Little Walder and Big Walder after all, but the sons of the boys he\u2019d known?\nThe great hall was dim and smoky. Rows of torches burned to left and right, grasped by skeletal human hands jutting from the walls. High overhead were wooden rafters black from smoke, and a vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. The air was heavy with the smells of wine and ale and roasted meat. Reek\u2019s stomach rumbled noisily at the scents, and his mouth began to water.\nLittle Walder pushed him stumbling past the long tables where the men of the garrison were eating. He could feel their eyes upon him. The best places, up near the dais, were occupied by Ramsay\u2019s favorites, the Bastard\u2019s Boys. Ben Bones, the old man who kept his lordship\u2019s beloved hunting hounds. Damon, called Damon Dance-for-Me, fair-haired and boyish. Grunt, who had lost his tongue for speaking carelessly in Lord Roose\u2019s hearing. Sour Alyn. Skinner. Yellow Dick. Farther down, below the salt, were others that Reek knew by sight if not by name: sworn swords and serjeants, soldiers and gaolers and torturers. But there were strangers too, faces he did not know. Some wrinkled their noses as he passed, whilst others laughed at the sight of him. Guests, Reek thought, his lordship\u2019s friends, and I am brought up to amuse them. A shiver of fear went through him.\nAt the high table the Bastard of Bolton sat in his lord father\u2019s seat, drinking from his father\u2019s cup. Two old men shared the high table with him, and Reek knew at a glance that both were lords. One was gaunt, with flinty eyes, a long white beard, and a face as hard as a winter frost. His jerkin was a ragged bearskin, worn and greasy. Underneath he wore a ringmail byrnie, even at table. The second lord was thin as well, but twisted where the first was straight. One of his shoulders was much higher than the other, and he stooped over his trencher like a vulture over carrion. His eyes were grey and greedy, his teeth yellow, his forked beard a tangle of snow and silver. Only a few wisps of white hair still clung to his spotted skull, but the cloak he wore was soft and fine, grey wool trimmed with black sable and fastened at the shoulder with a starburst wrought in beaten silver.\nRamsay was clad in black and pink\u2014black boots, black belt and scabbard, black leather jerkin over a pink velvet doublet slashed with dark red satin. In his right ear gleamed a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood. Yet for all the splendor of his garb, he remained an ugly man, big-boned and slope-shouldered, with a fleshiness to him that suggested that in later life he would run to fat. His skin was pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his mouth small, his hair long and dark and dry. His lips were wide and meaty, but the thing men noticed first about him were his eyes. He had his lord father\u2019s eyes\u2014small, close-set, queerly pale. Ghost grey, some men called the shade, but in truth his eyes were all but colorless, like two chips of dirty ice.\nAt the sight of Reek, he smiled a wet-lipped smile. \u201cThere he is. My sour old friend.\u201d To the men beside him he said, \u201cReek has been with me since I was a boy. My lord father gave him to me as a token of his love.\u201d\nThe two lords exchanged a look. \u201cI had heard your serving man was dead,\u201d said the one with the stooped shoulder. \u201cSlain by the Starks, they said.\u201d\nLord Ramsay chuckled. \u201cThe ironmen will tell you that what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. Like Reek. He smells of the grave, though, I grant you that.\u201d\n\u201cHe smells of nightsoil and stale vomit.\u201d The stoop-shouldered old lord tossed aside the bone that he\u2019d been gnawing on and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth. \u201cIs there some reason you must needs inflict him upon us whilst we\u2019re eating?\u201d\nThe second lord, the straight-backed old man in the mail byrnie, studied Reek with flinty eyes. \u201cLook again,\u201d he urged the other lord. \u201cHis hair\u2019s gone white and he is three stone thinner, aye, but this is no serving man. Have you forgotten?\u201d\nThe crookback lord looked again and gave a sudden snort. \u201cHim? Can it be? Stark\u2019s ward. Smiling, always smiling.\u201d\n\u201cHe smiles less often now,\u201d Lord Ramsay confessed. \u201cI may have broken some of his pretty white teeth.\u201d\n\u201cYou would have done better to slit his throat,\u201d said the lord in mail. \u201cA dog who turns against his master is fit for naught but skinning.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s been skinned, here and there,\u201d said Ramsay.\n\u201cYes, my lord. I was bad, my lord. Insolent and\u00a0\u2026\u201d He licked his lip, trying to think of what else he had done. Serve and obey, he told himself, and he\u2019ll let you live, and keep the parts that you still have. Serve and obey and remember your name. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with meek. \u201c\u2026\u00a0bad and\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood on your mouth,\u201d Ramsay observed. \u201cHave you been chewing on your fingers again, Reek?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, my lord, I swear.\u201d Reek had tried to bite his own ring finger off once, to stop it hurting after they had stripped the skin from it. Lord Ramsay would never simply cut off a man\u2019s finger. He preferred to flay it and let the exposed flesh dry and crack and fester. Reek had been whipped and racked and cut, but there was no pain half so excruciating as the pain that followed flaying. It was the sort of pain that drove men mad, and it could not be endured for long. Soon or late the victim would scream, \u201cPlease, no more, no more, stop it hurting, cut it off,\u201d and Lord Ramsay would oblige. It was a game they played. Reek had learned the rules, as his hands and feet could testify, but that one time he had forgotten and tried to end the pain himself, with his teeth. Ramsay had not been pleased, and the offense had cost Reek another toe. \u201cI ate a rat,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cA rat?\u201d Ramsay\u2019s pale eyes glittered in the torchlight. \u201cAll the rats in the Dreadfort belong to my lord father. How dare you make a meal of one without my leave.\u201d\nReek did not know what to say, so he said nothing. One wrong word could cost him another toe, even a finger. Thus far he had lost two fingers off his left hand and the pinky off his right, but only the little toe off his right foot against three from his left. Sometimes Ramsay would make japes about balancing him out. My lord was only japing, he tried to tell himself. He does not want to hurt me, he told me so, he only does it when I give him cause. His lord was merciful and kind. He might have flayed his face off for some of the things Reek had said, before he\u2019d learned his true name and proper place.\n\u201cThis grows tedious,\u201d said the lord in the mail byrnie. \u201cKill him and be done with it.\u201d\nLord Ramsay filled his cup with ale. \u201cThat would spoil our celebration, my lord. Reek, I have glad tidings for you. I am to be wed. My lord father is bringing me a Stark girl. Lord Eddard\u2019s daughter, Arya. You remember little Arya, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nArya Underfoot, he almost said. Arya Horseface. Robb\u2019s younger sister, brown-haired, long-faced, skinny as a stick, always dirty. Sansa was the pretty one. He remembered a time when he had thought that Lord Eddard Stark might marry him to Sansa and claim him for a son, but that had only been a child\u2019s fancy. Arya, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cI remember her. Arya.\u201d\n\u201cShe shall be the Lady of Winterfell, and me her lord.\u201d\nShe is only a girl. \u201cYes, my lord. Congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cWill you attend me at my wedding, Reek?\u201d\nHe hesitated. \u201cIf you wish it, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I do.\u201d\nHe hesitated again, wondering if this was some cruel trap. \u201cYes, my lord. If it please you. I would be honored.\u201d\n\u201cWe must take you out of that vile dungeon, then. Scrub you pink again, get you some clean clothes, some food to eat. Some nice soft porridge, would you like that? Perhaps a pease pie laced with bacon. I have a little task for you, and you\u2019ll need your strength back if you are to serve me. You do want to serve me, I know.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord. More than anything.\u201d A shiver went through him. \u201cI\u2019m your Reek. Please let me serve you. Please.\u201d\n\u201cSince you ask so nicely, how can I deny you?\u201d Ramsay Bolton smiled. \u201cI ride to war, Reek. And you will be coming with me, to help me fetch home my virgin bride.\u201d",

      "content": "BRAN\nSomething about the way the raven screamed sent a shiver running up Bran\u2019s spine. I am almost a man grown, he had to remind himself. I have to be brave now.\nBut the air was sharp and cold and full of fear. Even Summer was afraid. The fur on his neck was bristling. Shadows stretched against the hillside, black and hungry. All the trees were bowed and twisted by the weight of ice they carried. Some hardly looked like trees at all. Buried from root to crown in frozen snow, they huddled on the hill like giants, monstrous and misshapen creatures hunched against the icy wind. \u201cThey are here.\u201d\nThe ranger drew his longsword.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Meera\u2019s voice was hushed.\n\u201cClose. I don\u2019t know. Somewhere.\u201d\nThe raven shrieked again. \u201cHodor,\u201d whispered Hodor. He had his hands tucked up beneath his armpits. Icicles hung from the brown briar of his beard, and his mustache was a lump of frozen snot, glittering redly in the light of sunset.\n\u201cThose wolves are close as well,\u201d Bran warned them. \u201cThe ones that have been following us. Summer can smell them whenever we\u2019re downwind.\u201d\n\u201cWolves are the least of our woes,\u201d said Coldhands. \u201cWe have to climb. It will be dark soon. You would do well to be inside before night comes. Your warmth will draw them.\u201d He glanced to the west, where the light of the setting sun could be seen dimly through the trees, like the glow of a distant fire.\n\u201cIs this the only way in?\u201d asked Meera.\n\u201cThe back door is three leagues north, down a sinkhole.\u201d\nThat was all he had to say. Not even Hodor could climb down into a sinkhole with Bran heavy on his back, and Jojen could no more walk three leagues than run a thousand.\nMeera eyed the hill above. \u201cThe way looks clear.\u201d\n\u201cLooks,\u201d the ranger muttered darkly. \u201cCan you feel the cold? There\u2019s something here. Where are they?\u201d\n\u201cInside the cave?\u201d suggested Meera.\n\u201cThe cave is warded. They cannot pass.\u201d The ranger used his sword to point. \u201cYou can see the entrance there. Halfway up, between the weirwoods, that cleft in the rock.\u201d\n\u201cI see it,\u201d said Bran. Ravens were flying in and out.\nHodor shifted his weight. \u201cHodor.\u201d\n\u201cA fold in the rock, that\u2019s all I see,\u201d said Meera.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a passage there. Steep and twisty at first, a runnel through the rock. If you can reach it, you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cThe cave is warded.\u201d\nMeera studied the cleft in the hillside. \u201cIt can\u2019t be more than a thousand yards from here to there.\u201d\nNo, thought Bran, but all those yards are upward. The hill was steep and thickly wooded. The snow had stopped three days ago, but none of it had melted. Beneath the trees, the ground was blanketed in white, still pristine and unbroken. \u201cNo one\u2019s here,\u201d said Bran, bravely. \u201cLook at the snow. There are no footprints.\u201d\n\u201cThe white walkers go lightly on the snow,\u201d the ranger said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find no prints to mark their passage.\u201d A raven descended from above to settle on his shoulder. Only a dozen of the big black birds remained with them. The rest had vanished along the way; every dawn when they arose, there had been fewer of them. \u201cCome,\u201d the bird squawked. \u201cCome, come.\u201d\nThe three-eyed crow, thought Bran. The greenseer. \u201cIt\u2019s not so far,\u201d he said. \u201cA little climb, and we\u2019ll be safe. Maybe we can have a fire.\u201d All of them were cold and wet and hungry, except the ranger, and Jojen Reed was too weak to walk unaided.\n\u201cYou go.\u201d Meera Reed bent down beside her brother. He was settled in the bole of an oak, eyes closed, shivering violently. What little of his face could be seen beneath his hood and scarf was as colorless as the surrounding snow, but breath still puffed faintly from his nostrils whenever he exhaled. Meera had been carrying him all day. Food and fire will set him right again, Bran tried to tell himself, though he wasn\u2019t sure it would. \u201cI can\u2019t fight and carry Jojen both, the climb\u2019s too steep,\u201d Meera was saying. \u201cHodor, you take Bran up to that cave.\u201d\n\u201cHodor.\u201d Hodor clapped his hands together.\n\u201cJojen just needs to eat,\u201d Bran said, miserably. It had been twelve days since the elk had collapsed for the third and final time, since Coldhands had knelt beside it in the snowbank and murmured a blessing in some strange tongue as he slit its throat. Bran wept like a little girl when the bright blood came rushing out. He had never felt more like a cripple than he did then, watching helplessly as Meera Reed and Coldhands butchered the brave beast who had carried them so far. He told himself he would not eat, that it was better to go hungry than to feast upon a friend, but in the end he\u2019d eaten twice, once in his own skin and once in Summer\u2019s. As gaunt and starved as the elk had been, the steaks the ranger carved from him had sustained them for seven days, until they finished the last of them huddled over a fire in the ruins of an old hillfort.\n\u201cHe needs to eat,\u201d Meera agreed, smoothing her brother\u2019s brow. \u201cWe all do, but there\u2019s no food here. Go.\u201d\nBran blinked back a tear and felt it freeze upon his cheek. Coldhands took Hodor by the arm. \u201cThe light is fading. If they\u2019re not here now, they will be soon. Come.\u201d\nWordless for once, Hodor slapped the snow off his legs, and plowed upward through the snowdrifts with Bran upon his back. Coldhands stalked beside them, his blade in a black hand. Summer came after. In some places the snow was higher than he was, and the big direwolf had to stop and shake it off after plunging through the thin crust. As they climbed, Bran turned awkwardly in his basket to watch as Meera slid an arm beneath her brother to lift him to his feet. He\u2019s too heavy for her. She\u2019s half-starved, she\u2019s not as strong as she was. She clutched her frog spear in her other hand, jabbing the tines into the snow for a little more support. Meera had just begun to struggle up the hill, half-dragging and half-carrying her little brother, when Hodor passed between two trees, and Bran lost sight of them.\nThe hill grew steeper. Drifts of snow cracked under Hodor\u2019s boots. Once a rock moved beneath his foot and he slid backwards, and almost went tumbling back down the hill. The ranger caught him by the arm and saved him. \u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor. Every gust of wind filled the air with fine white powder that shone like glass in the last light of day. Ravens flapped around them. One flew ahead and vanished inside the cave. Only eighty yards now, Bran thought, that\u2019s not far at all.\nSummer stopped suddenly, at the bottom of a steep stretch of unbroken white snow. The direwolf turned his head, sniffed the air, then snarled. Fur bristling, he began to back away.\n\u201cHodor, stop,\u201d said Bran. \u201cHodor. Wait.\u201d Something was wrong. Summer smelled it, and so did he. Something bad. Something close. \u201cHodor, no, go back.\u201d\nColdhands was still climbing, and Hodor wanted to keep up. \u201cHodor, hodor, hodor,\u201d he grumbled loudly, to drown out Bran\u2019s complaints. His breathing had grown labored. Pale mist filled the air. He took a step, then another. The snow was almost waist deep and the slope was very steep. Hodor was leaning forward, grasping at rocks and trees with his hands as he climbed. Another step. Another. The snow Hodor disturbed slid downhill, starting a small avalanche behind them.\nSixty yards. Bran craned himself sideways to better see the cave. Then he saw something else. \u201cA fire!\u201d In the little cleft between the weirwood trees was a flickering glow, a ruddy light calling through the gathering gloom. \u201cLook, someone\u2014\u201d\nHodor screamed. He twisted, stumbled, fell.\nBran felt the world slide sideways as the big stableboy spun violently around. A jarring impact drove the breath from him. His mouth was full of blood and Hodor was thrashing and rolling, crushing the crippled boy beneath him.\nSomething has hold of his leg. For half a heartbeat Bran thought maybe a root had gotten tangled round his ankle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until the root moved. A hand, he saw, as the rest of the wight came bursting from beneath the snow.\nHodor kicked at it, slamming a snow-covered heel full into the thing\u2019s face, but the dead man did not even seem to feel it. Then the two of them were grappling, punching and clawing at each other, sliding down the hill. Snow filled Bran\u2019s mouth and nose as they rolled over, but in a half a heartbeat he was rolling up again. Something slammed against his head, a rock or a chunk of ice or a dead man\u2019s fist, he could not tell, and he found himself out of his basket, sprawled across the hillside, spitting snow, his gloved hand full of hair that he\u2019d torn from Hodor\u2019s head.\nAll around him, wights were rising from beneath the snow.\nTwo, three, four. Bran lost count. They surged up violently amidst sudden clouds of snow. Some wore black cloaks, some ragged skins, some nothing. All of them had pale flesh and black hands. Their eyes glowed like pale blue stars.\nThree of them descended on the ranger. Bran saw Coldhands slash one across the face. The thing kept right on coming, driving him back into the arms of another. Two more were going after Hodor, lumbering clumsily down the slope. Meera was going to climb right into this, Bran realized, with a sick sense of helpless terror. He smashed the snow and shouted out a warning.\nSomething grabbed hold of him.\nThat was when his shout became a scream. Bran filled a fist with snow and threw it, but the wight did not so much as blink. A black hand fumbled at his face, another at his belly. Its fingers felt like iron. He\u2019s going to pull my guts out.\nBut suddenly Summer was between them. Bran glimpsed skin tear like cheap cloth, heard the splintering of bone. He saw a hand and wrist rip loose, pale fingers wriggling, the sleeve faded black roughspun. Black, he thought, he\u2019s wearing black, he was one of the Watch. Summer flung the arm aside, twisted, and sank his teeth into the dead man\u2019s neck under the chin. When the big grey wolf wrenched free, he took most of the creature\u2019s throat out in an explosion of pale rotten meat.\nThe severed hand was still moving. Bran rolled away from it. On his belly, clawing at the snow, he glimpsed the trees above, pale and snow-cloaked, the orange glow between.\nFifty yards. If he could drag himself fifty yards, they could not get him. Damp seeped through his gloves as he clutched at roots and rocks, crawling toward the light. A little farther, just a little farther. Then you can rest beside the fire.\nThe last light had vanished from amongst the trees by then. Night had fallen. Coldhands was hacking and cutting at the circle of dead men that surrounded him. Summer was tearing at the one that he\u2019d brought down, its face between his teeth. No one was paying any mind to Bran. He crawled a little higher, dragging his useless legs behind him. If I can reach that cave\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cHoooodor\u201d came a whimper, from somewhere down below.\nAnd suddenly he was not Bran, the broken boy crawling through the snow, suddenly he was Hodor halfway down the hill, with the wight raking at his eyes. Roaring, he came lurching to his feet, throwing the thing violently aside. It went to one knee, began to rise again. Bran ripped Hodor\u2019s longsword from his belt. Deep inside he could hear poor Hodor whimpering still, but outside he was seven feet of fury with old iron in his hand. He raised the sword and brought it down upon the dead man, grunting as the blade sheared through wet wool and rusted mail and rotted leather, biting deep into the bones and flesh beneath. \u201cHODOR!\u201d he bellowed, and slashed again. This time he took the wight\u2019s head off at the neck, and for half a moment he exulted\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until a pair of dead hands came groping blindly for his throat.\nBran backed away, bleeding, and Meera Reed was there, driving her frog spear deep into the wight\u2019s back. \u201cHodor,\u201d Bran roared again, waving her uphill. \u201cHodor, hodor.\u201d Jojen was twisting feebly where she\u2019d laid him down. Bran went to him, dropped the longsword, gathered the boy into Hodor\u2019s arm, and lurched back to his feet. \u201cHODOR!\u201d he bellowed.\nMeera led the way back up the hill, jabbing at the wights when they came near. The things could not be hurt, but they were slow and clumsy. \u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor said with every step. \u201cHodor, hodor.\u201d He wondered what Meera would think if he should suddenly tell her that he loved her.\nUp above them, flaming figures were dancing in the snow.\nThe wights, Bran realized. Someone set the wights on fire.\nSummer was snarling and snapping as he danced around the closest, a great ruin of a man wreathed in swirling flame. He shouldn\u2019t get so close, what is he doing? Then he saw himself, sprawled facedown in the snow. Summer was trying to drive the thing away from him. What will happen if it kills me? the boy wondered. Will I be Hodor for good or all? Will I go back into Summer\u2019s skin? Or will I just be dead?\nThe world moved dizzily around him. White trees, black sky, red flames, everything was whirling, shifting, spinning. He felt himself stumbling. He could hear Hodor screaming, \u201cHodor hodor hodor hodor. Hodor hodor hodor hodor. Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor.\u201d A cloud of ravens was pouring from the cave, and he saw a little girl with a torch in hand, darting this way and that. For a moment Bran thought it was his sister Arya\u00a0\u2026\u00a0madly, for he knew his little sister was a thousand leagues away, or dead. And yet there she was, whirling, a scrawny thing, ragged, wild, her hair atangle. Tears filled Hodor\u2019s eyes and froze there.\nEverything turned inside out and upside down, and Bran found himself back inside his own skin, half-buried in the snow. The burning wight loomed over him, etched tall against the trees in their snowy shrouds. It was one of the naked ones, Bran saw, in the instant before the nearest tree shook off the snow that covered it and dropped it all down upon his head.\nThe next he knew, he was lying on a bed of pine needles beneath a dark stone roof. The cave. I\u2019m in the cave. His mouth still tasted of blood where he\u2019d bitten his tongue, but a fire was burning to his right, the heat washing over his face, and he had never felt anything so good. Summer was there, sniffing round him, and Hodor, soaking wet. Meera cradled Jojen\u2019s head in her lap. And the Arya thing stood over them, clutching her torch.\n\u201cThe snow,\u201d Bran said. \u201cIt fell on me. Buried me.\u201d\n\u201cHid you. I pulled you out.\u201d Meera nodded at the girl. \u201cIt was her who saved us, though. The torch\u00a0\u2026\u00a0fire kills them.\u201d\n\u201cFire burns them. Fire is always hungry.\u201d\nThat was not Arya\u2019s voice, nor any child\u2019s. It was a woman\u2019s voice, high and sweet, with a strange music in it like none that he had ever heard and a sadness that he thought might break his heart. Bran squinted, to see her better. It was a girl, but smaller than Arya, her skin dappled like a doe\u2019s beneath a cloak of leaves. Her eyes were queer\u2014large and liquid, gold and green, slitted like a cat\u2019s eyes. No one has eyes like that. Her hair was a tangle of brown and red and gold, autumn colors, with vines and twigs and withered flowers woven through it.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Meera Reed was asking.\nBran knew. \u201cShe\u2019s a child. A child of the forest.\u201d He shivered, as much from wonderment as cold. They had fallen into one of Old Nan\u2019s tales.\n\u201cThe First Men named us children,\u201d the little woman said. \u201cThe giants called us woh dak nag gran, the squirrel people, because we were small and quick and fond of trees, but we are no squirrels, no children. Our name in the True Tongue means those who sing the song of earth. Before your Old Tongue was ever spoken, we had sung our songs ten thousand years.\u201d\nMeera said, \u201cYou speak the Common Tongue now.\u201d\n\u201cFor him. The Bran boy. I was born in the time of the dragon, and for two hundred years I walked the world of men, to watch and listen and learn. I might be walking still, but my legs were sore and my heart was weary, so I turned my feet for home.\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred years?\u201d said Meera.\nThe child smiled. \u201cMen, they are the children.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d asked Bran.\n\u201cWhen I am needing one.\u201d She waved her torch toward the black crack in the back wall of the cave. \u201cOur way is down. You must come with me now.\u201d\nBran shivered again. \u201cThe ranger\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe cannot come.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill him.\u201d\n\u201cNo. They killed him long ago. Come now. It is warmer down deep, and no one will hurt you there. He is waiting for you.\u201d\n\u201cThe three-eyed crow?\u201d asked Meera.\n\u201cThe greenseer.\u201d And with that she was off, and they had no choice but to follow. Meera helped Bran back up onto Hodor\u2019s back, though his basket was half-crushed and wet from melting snow. Then she slipped an arm around her brother and shouldered him back onto his feet once more. His eyes opened. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cMeera? Where are we?\u201d When he saw the fire, he smiled. \u201cI had the strangest dream.\u201d\nThe way was cramped and twisty, and so low that Hodor soon was crouching. Bran hunched down as best he could, but even so, the top of his head was soon scraping and bumping against the ceiling. Loose dirt crumbled at each touch and dribbled down into his eyes and hair, and once he smacked his brow on a thick white root growing from the tunnel wall, with tendrils hanging from it and spiderwebs between its fingers.\nThe child went in front with the torch in hand, her cloak of leaves whispering behind her, but the passage turned so much that Bran soon lost sight of her. Then the only light was what was reflected off the passage walls. After they had gone down a little, the cave divided, but the left branch was dark as pitch, so even Hodor knew to follow the moving torch to the right.\nThe way the shadows shifted made it seem as if the walls were moving too. Bran saw great white snakes slithering in and out of the earth around him, and his heart thumped in fear. He wondered if they had blundered into a nest of milk snakes or giant grave worms, soft and pale and squishy. Grave worms have teeth.\nHodor saw them too. \u201cHodor,\u201d he whimpered, reluctant to go on. But when the girl child stopped to let them catch her, the torchlight steadied, and Bran realized that the snakes were only white roots like the one he\u2019d hit his head on. \u201cIt\u2019s weirwood roots,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember the heart tree in the godswood, Hodor? The white tree with the red leaves? A tree can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cHodor.\u201d Hodor plunged ahead, hurrying after the child and her torch, deeper into the earth. They passed another branching, and another, then came into an echoing cavern as large as the great hall of Winterfell, with stone teeth hanging from its ceiling and more poking up through its floor. The child in the leafy cloak wove a path through them. From time to time she stopped and waved her torch at them impatiently. This way, it seemed to say, this way, this way, faster.\nThere were more side passages after that, more chambers, and Bran heard dripping water somewhere to his right. When he looked off that way, he saw eyes looking back at them, slitted eyes that glowed bright, reflecting back the torchlight. More children, he told himself, the girl is not the only one, but Old Nan\u2019s tale of Gendel\u2019s children came back to him as well.\nThe roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone, closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others. All the color is gone, Bran realized suddenly. The world was black soil and white wood. The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant\u2019s legs, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us.\nThe light dwindled again. Small as she was, the child-who-was-not-a-child moved quickly when she wanted. As Hodor thumped after her, something crunched beneath his feet. His halt was so sudden that Meera and Jojen almost slammed into his back.\n\u201cBones,\u201d said Bran. \u201cIt\u2019s bones.\u201d The floor of the passage was littered with the bones of birds and beasts. But there were other bones as well, big ones that must have come from giants and small ones that could have been from children. On either side of them, in niches carved from the stone, skulls looked down on them. Bran saw a bear skull and a wolf skull, half a dozen human skulls and near as many giants. All the rest were small, queerly formed. Children of the forest. The roots had grown in and around and through them, every one. A few had ravens perched atop them, watching them pass with bright black eyes.\nThe last part of their dark journey was the steepest. Hodor made the final descent on his arse, bumping and sliding downward in a clatter of broken bones, loose dirt, and pebbles. The girl child was waiting for them, standing on one end of a natural bridge above a yawning chasm. Down below in the darkness, Bran heard the sound of rushing water. An underground river.\n\u201cDo we have to cross?\u201d Bran asked, as the Reeds came sliding down behind him. The prospect frightened him. If Hodor slipped on that narrow bridge, they would fall and fall.\n\u201cNo, boy,\u201d the child said. \u201cBehind you.\u201d She lifted her torch higher, and the light seemed to shift and change. One moment the flames burned orange and yellow, filling the cavern with a ruddy glow; then all the colors faded, leaving only black and white. Behind them Meera gasped. Hodor turned.\nBefore them a pale lord in ebon finery sat dreaming in a tangled nest of roots, a woven weirwood throne that embraced his withered limbs as a mother does a child.\nHis body was so skeletal and his clothes so rotted that at first Bran took him for another corpse, a dead man propped up so long that the roots had grown over him, under him, and through him. What skin the corpse lord showed was white, save for a bloody blotch that crept up his neck onto his cheek. His white hair was fine and thin as root hair and long enough to brush against the earthen floor. Roots coiled around his legs like wooden serpents. One burrowed through his breeches into the desiccated flesh of his thigh, to emerge again from his shoulder. A spray of dark red leaves sprouted from his skull, and grey mushrooms spotted his brow. A little skin remained, stretched across his face, tight and hard as white leather, but even that was fraying, and here and there the brown and yellow bone beneath was poking through.\n\u201cAre you the three-eyed crow?\u201d Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.\n\u201cA\u00a0\u2026\u00a0crow?\u201d The pale lord\u2019s voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. \u201cOnce, aye. Black of garb and black of blood.\u201d The clothes he wore were rotten and faded, spotted with moss and eaten through with worms, but once they had been black. \u201cI have been many things, Bran. Now I am as you see me, and now you will understand why I could not come to you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0except in dreams. I have watched you for a long time, watched you with a thousand eyes and one. I saw your birth, and that of your lord father before you. I saw your first step, heard your first word, was part of your first dream. I was watching when you fell. And now you are come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Bran said, \u201conly I\u2019m broken. Will you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0will you fix me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my legs, I mean?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the pale lord. \u201cThat is beyond my powers.\u201d\nBran\u2019s eyes filled with tears. We came such a long way. The chamber echoed to the sound of the black river.\n\u201cYou will never walk again, Bran,\u201d the pale lips promised, \u201cbut you will fly.\u201d",

      "content": "TYRION\nFor a long while he did not stir, but lay unmoving upon the heap of old sacks that served him for a bed, listening to the wind in the lines, to the lapping of the river at the hull.\nA full moon floated above the mast. It is following me downriver, watching me like some great eye. Despite the warmth of the musty skins that covered him, a shiver went through the little man. I need a cup of wine. A dozen cups of wine. But the moon would blink before that whoreson Griff let him quench his thirst. Instead he drank water, and was condemned to sleepless nights and days of sweats and shakes.\nThe dwarf sat up, cradling his head in his hands. Did I dream? All memory of it had fled. The nights had never been kind to Tyrion Lannister. He slept badly even on soft feather beds. On the Shy Maid, he made his bed atop the roof of the cabin, with a coil of hempen rope for a pillow. He liked it better up here than in the boat\u2019s cramped hold. The air was fresher, and the river sounds were sweeter than Duck\u2019s snoring. There was a price to be paid for such joys, though; the deck was hard, and he woke stiff and sore, his legs cramped and aching.\nThey were throbbing now, his calves gone hard as wood. He kneaded them with his fingers, trying to rub the ache away, but when he stood the pain was still enough to make him grimace. I need to bathe. His boy\u2019s clothes stank, and so did he. The others bathed in the river, but thus far he had not joined them. Some of the turtles he\u2019d seen in the shallows looked big enough to bite him in half. Bonesnappers, Duck called them. Besides, he did not want Lemore to see him naked.\nA wooden ladder led down from the cabin roof. Tyrion pulled on his boots and descended to the afterdeck, where Griff sat wrapped in a wolfskin cloak beside an iron brazier. The sellsword kept the night watch by himself, rising as the rest of his band sought their beds and retiring when the sun came up.\nTyrion squatted across from him and warmed his hands over the coals. Across the water nightingales were singing. \u201cDay soon,\u201d he said to Griff.\n\u201cNot soon enough. We need to be under way.\u201d If it had been up to Griff, the Shy Maid would continue downstream by night as well as day, but Yandry and Ysilla refused to risk their poleboat in the dark. The Upper Rhoyne was full of snags and sawyers, any one of which could rip out the Shy Maid\u2019s hull. Griff did not want to hear it. What he wanted was Volantis.\nThe sellsword\u2019s eyes were always moving, searching the night for\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what? Pirates? Stone men? Slave-catchers? The river had perils, the dwarf knew, but Griff himself struck Tyrion as more dangerous than any of them. He reminded Tyrion of Bronn, though Bronn had a sellsword\u2019s black humor and Griff had no humor at all.\n\u201cI would kill for a cup of wine,\u201d muttered Tyrion.\nGriff made no reply. You will die before you drink, his pale eyes seemed to say. Tyrion had drunk himself blind his first night on the Shy Maid. The next day he awoke with dragons fighting in his skull. Griff took one look at him retching over the side of the poleboat, and said, \u201cYou are done with drink.\u201d\n\u201cWine helps me sleep,\u201d Tyrion had protested. Wine drowns my dreams, he might have said.\n\u201cThen stay awake,\u201d Griff had replied, implacable.\nTo the east, the first pale light of day suffused the sky above the river. The waters of the Rhoyne slowly went from black to blue, to match the sellsword\u2019s hair and beard. Griff got to his feet. \u201cThe others should wake soon. The deck is yours.\u201d As the nightingales fell silent, the river larks took up their song. Egrets splashed amongst the reeds and left their tracks across the sandbars. The clouds in the sky were aglow: pink and purple, maroon and gold, pearl and saffron. One looked like a dragon. Once a man has seen a dragon in flight, let him stay at home and tend his garden in content, someone had written once, for this wide world has no greater wonder. Tyrion scratched at his scar and tried to recall the author\u2019s name. Dragons had been much in his thoughts of late.\n\u201cGood morrow, Hugor.\u201d Septa Lemore had emerged in her white robes, cinched at the waist with a woven belt of seven colors. Her hair flowed loose about her shoulders. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d\n\u201cFitfully, good lady. I dreamed of you again.\u201d A waking dream. He could not sleep, so he had eased a hand between his legs and imagined the septa atop him, breasts bouncing.\n\u201cA wicked dream, no doubt. You are a wicked man. Will you pray with me and ask forgiveness for your sins?\u201d\nOnly if we pray in the fashion of the Summer Isles. \u201cNo, but do give the Maiden a long, sweet kiss for me.\u201d\nLaughing, the septa walked to the prow of the boat. It was her custom to bathe in the river every morning. \u201cPlainly, this boat was not named for you,\u201d Tyrion called as she disrobed.\n\u201cThe Mother and the Father made us in their image, Hugor. We should glory in our bodies, for they are the work of gods.\u201d\nThe gods must have been drunk when they got to me. The dwarf watched Lemore slip into the water. The sight always made him hard. There was something wonderfully wicked about the thought of peeling the septa out of those chaste white robes and spreading her legs. Innocence despoiled, he thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though Lemore was not near as innocent as she appeared. She had stretch marks on her belly that could only have come from childbirth.\nYandry and Ysilla had risen with the sun and were going about their business. Yandry stole a glance at Septa Lemore from time to time as he was checking the lines. His small dark wife, Ysilla, took no notice. She fed some wood chips to the brazier on the afterdeck, stirred the coals with a blackened blade, and began to knead the dough for the morning biscuits.\nWhen Lemore climbed back onto the deck, Tyrion savored the sight of water trickling between her breasts, her smooth skin glowing golden in the morning light. She was past forty, more handsome than pretty, but still easy on the eye. Being randy is the next best thing to being drunk, he decided. It made him feel as if he was still alive. \u201cDid you see the turtle, Hugor?\u201d the septa asked him, wringing water from her hair. \u201cThe big ridgeback?\u201d\nThe early morning was the best time for seeing turtles. During the day they would swim down deep, or hide in cuts along the banks, but when the sun was newly risen they came to the surface. Some liked to swim beside the boat. Tyrion had glimpsed a dozen different sorts: large turtles and small ones, flatbacks and red-ears, softshells and bonesnappers, brown turtles, green turtles, black turtles, clawed turtles and horned turtles, turtles whose ridged and patterned shells were covered with whorls of gold and jade and cream. Some were so large they could have borne a man upon their backs. Yandry swore the Rhoynar princes used to ride them across the river. He and his wife were Greenblood born, a pair of Dornish orphans come home to Mother Rhoyne.\n\u201cI missed the ridgeback.\u201d I was watching the naked woman.\n\u201cI am sad for you.\u201d Lemore slipped her robe over her head. \u201cI know you only rise so early in hopes of seeing turtles.\u201d\n\u201cI like to watch the sun come up as well.\u201d It was like watching a maiden rising naked from her bath. Some might be prettier than others, but every one was full of promise. \u201cThe turtles have their charms, I will allow. Nothing delights me so much as the sight of a nice pair of shapely\u00a0\u2026\u00a0shells.\u201d\nSepta Lemore laughed. Like everyone else aboard the Shy Maid, she had her secrets. She was welcome to them. I do not want to know her, I only want to fuck her. She knew it too. As she hung her septa\u2019s crystal about her neck, to nestle in the cleft between her breasts, she teased him with a smile.\nYandry pulled up the anchor, slid one of the long poles off the cabin roof, and pushed them off. Two of the herons raised their heads to watch as the Shy Maid drifted away from the bank, out into the current. Slowly the boat began to move downstream. Yandry went to the tiller. Ysilla was turning the biscuits. She laid an iron pan atop the brazier and put the bacon in. Some days she cooked biscuits and bacon; some days bacon and biscuits. Once every fortnight there might be a fish, but not today.\nWhen Ysilla turned her back, Tyrion snatched a biscuit off the brazier, darting away just in time to avoid a smack from her fearsome wooden spoon. They were best when eaten hot, dripping with honey and butter. The smell of the bacon cooking soon fetched Duck up from the hold. He sniffed over the brazier, received a swack from Ysilla\u2019s spoon, and went back to have his morning piss off the stern.\nTyrion waddled over to join him. \u201cNow here\u2019s a sight to see,\u201d he quipped as they were emptying their bladders, \u201ca dwarf and a duck, making the mighty Rhoyne that much mightier.\u201d\nYandry snorted in derision. \u201cMother Rhoyne has no need of your water, Yollo. She is the greatest river in the world.\u201d\nTyrion shook off the last few drops. \u201cBig enough to drown a dwarf, I grant you. The Mander is as broad, though. So is the Trident, near its mouth. The Blackwater runs deeper.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not know the river. Wait, and you will see.\u201d\nThe bacon turned crisp, the biscuits golden brown. Young Griff stumbled up onto deck yawning. \u201cGood morrow, all.\u201d The lad was shorter than Duck, but his lanky build suggested that he had not yet come into his full growth. This beardless boy could have any maiden in the Seven Kingdoms, blue hair or no. Those eyes of his would melt them. Like his sire, Young Griff had blue eyes, but where the father\u2019s eyes were pale, the son\u2019s were dark. By lamplight they turned black, and in the light of dusk they seemed purple. His eyelashes were as long as any woman\u2019s.\n\u201cI smell bacon,\u201d the lad said, pulling on his boots.\n\u201cGood bacon,\u201d said Ysilla. \u201cSit.\u201d\nShe fed them on the afterdeck, pressing honeyed biscuits on Young Griff and hitting Duck\u2019s hand with her spoon whenever he made a grab for more bacon. Tyrion pulled apart two biscuits, filled them with bacon, and carried one to Yandry at the tiller. Afterward he helped Duck to raise the Shy Maid\u2019s big lateen sail. Yandry took them out into the center of the river, where the current was strongest. The Shy Maid was a sweet boat. Her draft was so shallow she could work her way up even the smallest of the river\u2019s vassal streams, negotiating sandbars that would have stranded larger vessels, yet with her sail raised and a current under her, she could make good speed. That could mean life and death on the upper reaches of the Rhoyne, Yandry claimed. \u201cThere is no law above the Sorrows, not for a thousand years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no people, so far as I can see.\u201d He\u2019d glimpsed some ruins along the banks, piles of masonry overgrown by vines and moss and flowers, but no other signs of human habitation.\n\u201cYou do not know the river, Yollo. A pirate boat may lurk up any stream, and escaped slaves oft hide amongst the ruins. The slave-catchers seldom come so far north.\u201d\n\u201cSlave-catchers would be a welcome change from turtles.\u201d Not being an escaped slave, Tyrion need not fear being caught. And no pirate was like to bother a poleboat moving downstream. The valuable goods came up the river from Volantis.\nWhen the bacon was gone, Duck punched Young Griff in the shoulder. \u201cTime to raise some bruises. Swords today, I think.\u201d\n\u201cSwords?\u201d Young Griff grinned. \u201cSwords will be sweet.\u201d\nTyrion helped him dress for the bout, in heavy breeches, padded doublet, and a dinted suit of old steel plate. Ser Rolly shrugged into his mail and boiled leather. Both set helms upon their heads and chose blunted longswords from the bundle in the weapons chest. They set to on the afterdeck, having at each other lustily whilst the rest of the morning company looked on.\nWhen they fought with mace or blunted longaxe, Ser Rolly\u2019s greater size and strength would quickly overwhelm his charge; with swords the contests were more even. Neither man had taken up a shield this morning, so it was a game of slash and parry, back and forth across the deck. The river rang to the sounds of their combat. Young Griff landed more blows, though Duck\u2019s were harder. After a while, the bigger man began to tire. His cuts came a little slower, a little lower. Young Griff turned them all and launched a furious attack that forced Ser Rolly back. When they reached the stern, the lad tied up their blades and slammed a shoulder into Duck, and the big man went into the river.\nHe came up sputtering and cursing, bellowing for someone to fish him out before a \u2019snapper ate his privates. Tyrion tossed a line to him. \u201cDucks should swim better than that,\u201d he said as he and Yandry were hauling the knight back aboard the Shy Maid.\nSer Rolly grabbed Tyrion by the collar. \u201cLet us see how dwarfs swim,\u201d he said, chucking him headlong into the Rhoyne.\nThe dwarf laughed last; he could paddle passably well, and did\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until his legs began to cramp. Young Griff extended him a pole. \u201cYou are not the first to try and drown me,\u201d he told Duck, as he was pouring river water from his boot. \u201cMy father threw me down a well the day I was born, but I was so ugly that the water witch who lived down there spat me back.\u201d He pulled off the other boot, then did a cartwheel along the deck, spraying all of them.\nYoung Griff laughed. \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d\n\u201cThe mummers taught me,\u201d he lied. \u201cMy mother loved me best of all her children because I was so small. She nursed me at her breast till I was seven. That made my brothers jealous, so they stuffed me in a sack and sold me to a mummer\u2019s troupe. When I tried to run off the master mummer cut off half my nose, so I had no choice but to go with them and learn to be amusing.\u201d\nThe truth was rather different. His uncle had taught him a bit of tumbling when he was six or seven. Tyrion had taken to it eagerly. For half a year he cartwheeled his merry way about Casterly Rock, bringing smiles to the faces of septons, squires, and servants alike. Even Cersei laughed to see him once or twice.\nAll that ended abruptly the day his father returned from a sojourn in King\u2019s Landing. That night at supper Tyrion surprised his sire by walking the length of the high table on his hands. Lord Tywin was not pleased. \u201cThe gods made you a dwarf. Must you be a fool as well? You were born a lion, not a monkey.\u201d\nAnd you\u2019re a corpse, Father, so I\u2019ll caper as I please.\n\u201cYou have a gift for making men smile,\u201d Septa Lemore told Tyrion as he was drying off his toes. \u201cYou should thank the Father Above. He gives gifts to all his children.\u201d\n\u201cHe does,\u201d he agreed pleasantly. And when I die, please let them bury with me a crossbow, so I can thank the Father Above for his gifts the same way I thanked the father below.\nHis clothing was still soaked from his involuntary swim, clinging to his arms and legs uncomfortably. Whilst Young Griff went off with Septa Lemore to be instructed in the mysteries of the Faith, Tyrion stripped off the wet clothes and donned dry ones. Duck had a good guffaw when he emerged on deck again. He could not blame him. Dressed as he was, he made a comic sight. His doublet was divided down the middle; the left side was purple velvet with bronze studs; the right, yellow wool embroidered in green floral patterns. His breeches were similarly split; the right leg was solid green, the left leg striped in red and white. One of Illyrio\u2019s chests had been packed with a child\u2019s clothing, musty but well made. Septa Lemore had slit each garment apart, then sewn them back together, joining half of this to half of that to fashion a crude motley. Griff had even insisted that Tyrion help with the cutting and sewing. No doubt he meant for it to be humbling, but Tyrion enjoyed the needlework. Lemore was always pleasant company, despite her penchant for scolding him whenever he said something rude about the gods. If Griff wants to cast me as the fool, I\u2019ll play the game. Somewhere, he knew, Lord Tywin Lannister was horrified, and that took the sting from it.\nHis other duty was anything but foolish. Duck has his sword, I my quill and parchment. Griff had commanded him to set down all he knew of dragonlore. The task was a formidable one, but the dwarf labored at it every day, scratching away as best he could as he sat cross-legged on the cabin roof.\nTyrion had read much and more of dragons through the years. The greater part of those accounts were idle tales and could not be relied on, and the books that Illyrio had provided them were not the ones he might have wished for. What he really wanted was the complete text of The Fires of the Freehold, Galendro\u2019s history of Valyria. No complete copy was known to Westeros, however; even the Citadel\u2019s lacked twenty-seven scrolls. They must have a library in Old Volantis, surely. I may find a better copy there, if I can find a way inside the Black Walls to the city\u2019s heart.\nHe was less hopeful concerning Septon Barth\u2019s Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History. Barth had been a blacksmith\u2019s son who rose to be King\u2019s Hand during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator. His enemies always claimed he was more sorcerer than septon. Baelor the Blessed had ordered all Barth\u2019s writings destroyed when he came to the Iron Throne. Ten years ago, Tyrion had read a fragment of Unnatural History that had eluded the Blessed Baelor, but he doubted that any of Barth\u2019s work had found its way across the narrow sea. And of course there was even less chance of his coming on the fragmentary, anonymous, blood-soaked tome sometimes called Blood and Fire and sometimes The Death of Dragons, the only surviving copy of which was supposedly hidden away in a locked vault beneath the Citadel.\nWhen the Halfmaester appeared on deck, yawning, the dwarf was writing down what he recalled concerning the mating habits of dragons, on which subject Barth, Munkun, and Thomax held markedly divergent views. Haldon stalked to the stern to piss down at the sun where it shimmered on the water, breaking apart with every puff of wind. \u201cWe should reach the junction with the Noyne by evening, Yollo,\u201d the Halfmaester called out.\nTyrion glanced up from his writing. \u201cMy name is Hugor. Yollo is hiding in my breeches. Shall I let him out to play?\u201d\n\u201cBest not. You might frighten the turtles.\u201d Haldon\u2019s smile was as sharp as the blade of a dagger. \u201cWhat did you tell me was the name of that street in Lannisport where you were born, Yollo?\u201d\n\u201cIt was an alley. It had no name.\u201d Tyrion took a mordant pleasure in inventing the details of the colorful life of Hugor Hill, also known as Yollo, a bastard out of Lannisport. The best lies are seasoned with a bit of truth. The dwarf knew he sounded like a westerman, and a highborn westerman at that, so Hugor must needs be some lordling\u2019s by-blow. Born in Lannisport because he knew that city better than Oldtown or King\u2019s Landing, and cities were where most dwarfs ended up, even those whelped by Goodwife Bumpkin in the turnip patch. The countryside had no grotesqueries or mummer shows\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though it did have wells aplenty, to swallow up unwanted kittens, three-headed calves, and babes like him.\n\u201cI see you have been defacing more good parchment, Yollo.\u201d Haldon laced up his breeches.\n\u201cNot all of us can be half a maester.\u201d Tyrion\u2019s hand was cramping. He put his quill aside and flexed his stubby fingers. \u201cFancy another game of cyvasse?\u201d The Halfmaester always defeated him, but it was a way to pass the time.\n\u201cThis evening. Will you join us for Young Griff\u2019s lesson?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? Someone needs to correct your errors.\u201d\nThere were four cabins on the Shy Maid. Yandry and Ysilla shared one, Griff and Young Griff another. Septa Lemore had a cabin to herself, as did Haldon. The Halfmaester\u2019s cabin was the largest of the four. One wall was lined with bookshelves and bins stacked with old scrolls and parchments; another held racks of ointments, herbs, and potions. Golden light slanted through the wavy yellow glass of the round window. The furnishings included a bunk, a writing desk, a chair, a stool, and the Halfmaester\u2019s cyvasse table, strewn with carved wooden pieces.\nThe lesson began with languages. Young Griff spoke the Common Tongue as if he had been born to it, and was fluent in High Valyrian, the low dialects of Pentos, Tyrosh, Myr, and Lys, and the trade talk of sailors. The Volantene dialect was as new to him as it was to Tyrion, so every day they learned a few more words whilst Haldon corrected their mistakes. Meereenese was harder; its roots were Valyrian as well, but the tree had been grafted onto the harsh, ugly tongue of Old Ghis. \u201cYou need a bee up your nose to speak Ghiscari properly,\u201d Tyrion complained. Young Griff laughed, but the Halfmaester only said, \u201cAgain.\u201d The boy obeyed, though he rolled his eyes along with his zzzs this time. He has a better ear than me, Tyrion was forced to admit, though I\u2019ll wager my tongue is still more nimble.\nGeometry followed languages. There the boy was less adroit, but Haldon was a patient teacher, and Tyrion was able to make himself of use as well. He had learned the mysteries of squares and circles and triangles from his father\u2019s maesters at Casterly Rock, and they came back more quickly than he would have thought.\nBy the time they turned to history, Young Griff was growing restive. \u201cWe were discussing the history of Volantis,\u201d Haldon said to him. \u201cCan you tell Yollo the difference between a tiger and an elephant?\u201d\n\u201cVolantis is the oldest of the Nine Free Cities, first daughter of Valyria,\u201d the lad replied, in a bored tone. \u201cAfter the Doom it pleased the Volantenes to consider themselves the heirs of the Freehold and rightful rulers of the world, but they were divided as to how dominion might best be achieved. The Old Blood favored the sword, while the merchants and moneylenders advocated trade. As they contended for rule of the city, the factions became known as the tigers and elephants, respectively.\n\u201cThe tigers held sway for almost a century after the Doom of Valyria. For a time they were successful. A Volantene fleet took Lys and a Volantene army captured Myr, and for two generations all three cities were ruled from within the Black Walls. That ended when the tigers tried to swallow Tyrosh. Pentos came into the war on the Tyroshi side, along with the Westerosi Storm King. Braavos provided a Lyseni exile with a hundred warships, Aegon Targaryen flew forth from Dragonstone on the Black Dread, and Myr and Lys rose up in rebellion. The war left the Disputed Lands a waste, and freed Lys and Myr from the yoke. The tigers suffered other defeats as well. The fleet they sent to reclaim Valyria vanished in the Smoking Sea. Qohor and Norvos broke their power on the Rhoyne when the fire galleys fought on Dagger Lake. Out of the east came the Dothraki, driving smallfolk from their hovels and nobles from their estates, until only grass and ruins remained from the forest of Qohor to the headwaters of the Selhoru. After a century of war, Volantis found herself broken, bankrupt, and depopulated. It was then that the elephants rose up. They have held sway ever since. Some years the tigers elect a triarch, and some years they do not, but never more than one, so the elephants have ruled the city for three hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cAnd the present triarchs?\u201d\n\u201cMalaquo is a tiger, Nyessos and Doniphos are elephants.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what lesson can we draw from Volantene history?\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to conquer the world, you best have dragons.\u201d\nTyrion could not help but laugh.\nLater, when Young Griff went up on deck to help Yandry with the sails and poles, Haldon set up his cyvasse table for their game. Tyrion watched with mismatched eyes, and said, \u201cThe boy is bright. You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a heady stew for some sellsword\u2019s son.\u201d\n\u201cA book can be as dangerous as a sword in the right hands,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cTry to give me a better battle this time, Yollo. You play cyvasse as badly as you tumble.\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to lull you into a false sense of confidence,\u201d said Tyrion, as they arranged their tiles on either side of a carved wooden screen. \u201cYou think you taught me how to play, but things are not always as they seem. Perhaps I learned the game from the cheesemonger, have you considered that?\u201d\n\u201cIllyrio does not play cyvasse.\u201d\nNo, thought the dwarf, he plays the game of thrones, and you and Griff and Duck are only pieces, to be moved where he will and sacrificed at need, just as he sacrificed Viserys. \u201cThe blame must fall on you, then. If I play badly, it is your doing.\u201d\nThe Halfmaester chuckled. \u201cYollo, I shall miss you when the pirates cut your throat.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are these famous pirates? I am beginning to think that you and Illyrio made them all up.\u201d\n\u201cThey are thickest on the stretch of river between Ar Noy and the Sorrows. Above the ruins of Ar Noy, the Qohorik rule the river, and below the Sorrows the galleys of Volantis hold sway, but neither city claims the waters in between, so the pirates have made it their own. Dagger Lake is full of islands where they lurk in hidden caves and secret strongholds. Are you ready?\u201d\n\u201cFor you? Beyond a doubt. For the pirates? Less so.\u201d\nHaldon removed the screen. Each of them contemplated the other\u2019s opening array. \u201cYou are learning,\u201d the Halfmaester said.\nTyrion almost grabbed his dragon but thought better of it. Last game he had brought her out too soon and lost her to a trebuchet. \u201cIf we do meet these fabled pirates, I may join up with them. I\u2019ll tell them that my name is Hugor Halfmaester.\u201d He moved his light horse toward Haldon\u2019s mountains.\nHaldon answered with an elephant. \u201cHugor Halfwit would suit you better.\u201d\n\u201cI only need half my wits to be a match for you.\u201d Tyrion moved up his heavy horse to support the light. \u201cPerhaps you would care to wager on the outcome?\u201d\nThe Halfmaester arched an eyebrow. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cI have no coin. We\u2019ll play for secrets.\u201d\n\u201cGriff would cut my tongue out.\u201d\n\u201cAfraid, are you? I would be if I were you.\u201d\n\u201cThe day you defeat me at cyvasse will be the day turtles crawl out my arse.\u201d The Halfmaester moved his spears. \u201cYou have your wager, little man.\u201d\nTyrion stretched a hand out for his dragon.\nIt was three hours later when the little man finally crept back up on deck to empty his bladder. Duck was helping Yandry wrestle down the sail, while Ysilla took the tiller. The sun hung low above the reed-beds along the western bank, as the wind began to gust and rip. I need that skin of wine, the dwarf thought. His legs were cramped from squatting on that stool, and he felt so light-headed that he was lucky not to fall into the river.\n\u201cYollo,\u201d Duck called. \u201cWhere\u2019s Haldon?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken to his bed, in some discomfort. There are turtles crawling out his arse.\u201d He left the knight to sort that out and crawled up the ladder to the cabin roof. Off to the east, there was darkness gathering behind a rocky island.\nSepta Lemore found him there. \u201cCan you feel the storms in the air, Hugor Hill? Dagger Lake is ahead of us, where pirates prowl. And beyond that lie the Sorrows.\u201d\nNot mine. I carry mine own sorrows with me, everywhere I go. He thought of Tysha and wondered where whores go. Why not Volantis? Perhaps I\u2019ll find her there. A man should cling to hope. He wondered what he would say to her. I am sorry that I let them rape you, love. I thought you were a whore. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? I want to go back to our cottage, to the way it was when we were man and wife.\nThe island fell away behind them. Tyrion saw ruins rising along the eastern bank: crooked walls and fallen towers, broken domes and rows of rotted wooden pillars, streets choked by mud and overgrown with purple moss. Another dead city, ten times as large as Ghoyan Drohe. Turtles lived there now, big bonesnappers. The dwarf could see them basking in the sun, brown and black hummocks with jagged ridges down the center of their shells. A few saw the Shy Maid and slid down into the water, leaving ripples in their wake. This would not be a good place for a swim.\nThen, through the twisted half-drowned trees and wide wet streets, he glimpsed the silvery sheen of sunlight upon water. Another river, he knew at once, rushing toward the Rhoyne. The ruins grew taller as the land grew narrower, until the city ended on a point of land where stood the remains of a colossal palace of pink and green marble, its collapsed domes and broken spires looming large above a row of covered archways. Tyrion saw more \u2019snappers sleeping in the slips where half a hundred ships might once have docked. He knew where he was then. That was Nymeria\u2019s palace, and this is all that remains of Ny Sar, her city.\n\u201cYollo,\u201d shouted Yandry as the Shy Maid passed the point, \u201ctell me again of those Westerosi rivers as big as Mother Rhoyne.\u201d\n\u201cI did not know,\u201d he called back. \u201cNo river in the Seven Kingdoms is half so wide as this.\u201d The new river that had joined them was a close twin to the one they had been sailing down, and that one alone had almost matched the Mander or the Trident.\n\u201cThis is Ny Sar, where the Mother gathers in her Wild Daughter, Noyne,\u201d said Yandry, \u201cbut she will not reach her widest point until she meets her other daughters. At Dagger Lake the Qhoyne comes rushing in, the Darkling Daughter, full of gold and amber from the Axe and pine-cones from the Forest of Qohor. South of there the Mother meets Lhorulu, the Smiling Daughter from the Golden Fields. Where they join once stood Chroyane, the festival city, where the streets were made of water and the houses made of gold. Then south and east again for long leagues, until at last comes creeping in Selhoru, the Shy Daughter who hides her course in reeds and writhes. There Mother Rhoyne waxes so wide that a man upon a boat in the center of the stream cannot see a shore to either side. You shall see, my little friend.\u201d\nI shall, the dwarf was thinking, when he spied a rippling ahead not six yards from the boat. He was about to point it out to Lemore when it came to the surface with a wash of water that rocked the Shy Maid sideways.\nIt was another turtle, a horned turtle of enormous size, its dark green shell mottled with brown and overgrown with water moss and crusty black river molluscs. It raised its head and bellowed, a deep-throated thrumming roar louder than any warhorn that Tyrion had ever heard. \u201cWe are blessed,\u201d Ysilla was crying loudly, as tears streamed down her face. \u201cWe are blessed, we are blessed.\u201d\nDuck was hooting, and Young Griff too. Haldon came out on deck to learn the cause of the commotion\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but too late. The giant turtle had vanished below the water once again. \u201cWhat was the cause of all that noise?\u201d the Halfmaester asked.\n\u201cA turtle,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cA turtle bigger than this boat.\u201d\n\u201cIt was him,\u201d cried Yandry. \u201cThe Old Man of the River.\u201d\nAnd why not? Tyrion grinned. Gods and wonders always appear, to attend the birth of kings.",

      "content": "DAVOS\nThe Merry Midwife stole into White Harbor on the evening tide, her patched sail rippling with every gust of wind.\nShe was an old cog, and even in her youth no one had ever called her pretty. Her figurehead showed a laughing woman holding an infant by one foot, but the woman\u2019s cheeks and the babe\u2019s bottom were both pocked by wormholes. Uncounted layers of drab brown paint covered her hull; her sails were grey and tattered. She was not a ship to draw a second glance, unless it was to wonder how she stayed afloat. The Merry Midwife was known in White Harbor too. For years she had plied a humble trade between there and Sisterton.\nIt was not the sort of arrival that Davos Seaworth had anticipated when he\u2019d set sail with Salla and his fleet. All this had seemed simpler then. The ravens had not brought King Stannis the allegiance of White Harbor, so His Grace would send an envoy to treat with Lord Manderly in person. As a show of strength, Davos would arrive aboard Salla\u2019s galleas Valyrian, with the rest of the Lysene fleet behind her. Every hull was striped: black and yellow, pink and blue, green and white, purple and gold. The Lyseni loved bright hues, and Salladhor Saan was the most colorful of all. Salladhor the Splendid, Davos thought, but the storms wrote an end to all of that.\nInstead he would smuggle himself into the city, as he might have done twenty years before. Until he knew how matters stood here, it was more prudent to play the common sailor, not the lord.\nWhite Harbor\u2019s walls of whitewashed stone rose before them, on the eastern shore where the White Knife plunged into the firth. Some of the city\u2019s defenses had been strengthened since the last time Davos had been here, half a dozen years before. The jetty that divided the inner and outer harbors had been fortified with a long stone wall, thirty feet tall and almost a mile long, with towers every hundred yards. There was smoke rising from Seal Rock as well, where once there had been only ruins. That could be good or bad, depending on what side Lord Wyman chooses.\nDavos had always been fond of this city, since first he\u2019d come here as a cabin boy on Cobblecat. Though small compared to Oldtown and King\u2019s Landing, it was clean and well-ordered, with wide straight cobbled streets that made it easy for a man to find his way. The houses were built of whitewashed stone, with steeply pitched roofs of dark grey slate. Roro Uhoris, the Cobblecat\u2019s cranky old master, used to claim that he could tell one port from another just by the way they smelled. Cities were like women, he insisted; each one had its own unique scent. Oldtown was as flowery as a perfumed dowager. Lannisport was a milkmaid, fresh and earthy, with woodsmoke in her hair. King\u2019s Landing reeked like some unwashed whore. But White Harbor\u2019s scent was sharp and salty, and a little fishy too. \u201cShe smells the way a mermaid ought to smell,\u201d Roro said. \u201cShe smells of the sea.\u201d\nShe still does, thought Davos, but he could smell the peat smoke drifting off Seal Rock too. The sea stone dominated the approaches to the outer harbor, a massive grey-green upthrust looming fifty feet above the waters. Its top was crowned with a circle of weathered stones, a ringfort of the First Men that had stood desolate and abandoned for hundreds of years. It was not abandoned now. Davos could see scorpions and spitfires behind the standing stones, and crossbowmen peering between them. It must be cold up there, and wet. On all his previous visits, seals could be seen basking on the broken rocks below. The Blind Bastard always made him count them whenever the Cobblecat set sail from White Harbor; the more seals there were, Roro said, the more luck they would have on their voyage. There were no seals now. The smoke and the soldiers had frightened them away. A wiser man would see a caution in that. If I had a thimble full of sense, I would have gone with Salla. He could have made his way back south, to Marya and their sons. I have lost four sons in the king\u2019s service, and my fifth serves as his squire. I should have the right to cherish the two boys who still remain. It has been too long since I saw them.\nAt Eastwatch, the black brothers told him there was no love between the Manderlys of White Harbor and the Boltons of the Dreadfort. The Iron Throne had raised Roose Bolton up to Warden of the North, so it stood to reason that Wyman Manderly should declare for Stannis. White Harbor cannot stand alone. The city needs an ally, a protector. Lord Wyman needs King Stannis as much as Stannis needs him. Or so it seemed at Eastwatch.\nSisterton had undermined those hopes. If Lord Borrell told it true, if the Manderlys meant to join their strength to the Boltons and the Freys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no, he would not dwell on that. He would know the truth soon enough. He prayed he had not come too late.\nThat jetty wall conceals the inner harbor, he realized, as the Merry Midwife was pulling down her sail. The outer harbor was larger, but the inner harbor offered better anchorage, sheltered by the city wall on one side and the looming mass of the Wolf\u2019s Den on another, and now by the jetty wall as well. At Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Cotter Pyke told Davos that Lord Wyman was building war galleys. There could have been a score of ships concealed behind those walls, waiting only a command to put to sea.\nBehind the city\u2019s thick white walls, the New Castle rose proud and pale upon its hill. Davos could see the domed roof of the Sept of the Snows as well, surmounted by tall statues of the Seven. The Manderlys had brought the Faith north with them when they were driven from the Reach. White Harbor had its godswood too, a brooding tangle of root and branch and stone locked away behind the crumbling black walls of the Wolf\u2019s Den, an ancient fortress that served only as a prison now. But for the most part the septons ruled here.\nThe merman of House Manderly was everywhere in evidence, flying from the towers of the New Castle, above the Seal Gate, and along the city walls. At Eastwatch, the northmen insisted that White Harbor would never abandon its allegiance to Winterfell, but Davos saw no sign of the direwolf of Stark. There are no lions either. Lord Wyman cannot have declared for Tommen yet, or he would have raised his standard.\nThe dockside wharves were swarming. A clutter of small boats were tied up along the fish market, off-loading their catches. He saw three river runners too, long lean boats built tough to brave the swift currents and rocky shoots of the White Knife. It was the seagoing vessels that interested him most, however; a pair of carracks as drab and tattered as the Merry Midwife, the trading galley Storm Dancer, the cogs Brave Magister and Horn of Plenty, a galleas from Braavos marked by her purple hull and sails\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and there beyond, the warship.\nThe sight of her sent a knife through his hopes. Her hull was black and gold, her figurehead a lion with an upraised paw. Lionstar, read the letters on her stern, beneath a fluttering banner that bore the arms of the boy king on the Iron Throne. A year ago, he would not have been able to read them, but Maester Pylos had taught him some of the letters back on Dragonstone. For once, the reading gave him little pleasure. Davos had been praying that the galley had been lost in the same storms that had ravaged Salla\u2019s fleet, but the gods had not been so kind. The Freys were here, and he would need to face them.\nThe Merry Midwife tied up to the end of a weathered wooden pier in the outer harbor, well away from Lionstar. As her crew made her fast to the pilings and lowered a gangplank, her captain sauntered up to Davos. Casso Mogat was a mongrel of the narrow sea, fathered on a Sisterton whore by an Ibbenese whaler. Only five feet tall and very hirsute, he dyed his hair and whiskers a mossy green. It made him look like a tree stump in yellow boots. Despite his appearance, he seemed a good sailor, though a hard master to his crew. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d\n\u201cA day at least. It may be longer.\u201d Davos had found that lords liked to keep you waiting. They did it to make you anxious, he suspected, and to demonstrate their power.\n\u201cThe Midwife will linger here three days. No longer. They will look for me back in Sisterton.\u201d\n\u201cIf things go well, I could be back by the morrow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if these things go badly?\u201d\nI may not be back at all. \u201cYou need not wait for me.\u201d\nA pair of customs men were clambering aboard as he went down the gangplank, but neither gave him so much as a glance. They were there to see the captain and inspect the hold; common seamen did not concern them, and few men looked as common as Davos. He was of middling height, his shrewd peasant\u2019s face weathered by wind and sun, his grizzled beard and brown hair well salted with grey. His garb was plain as well: old boots, brown breeches and blue tunic, a woolen mantle of undyed wool, fastened with a wooden clasp. He wore a pair of salt-stained leather gloves to hide the stubby fingers of the hand that Stannis had shortened, so many years ago. Davos hardly looked a lord, much less a King\u2019s Hand. That was all to the good until he knew how matters stood here.\nHe made his way along the wharf and through the fish market. The Brave Magister was taking on some mead. The casks stood four high along the pier. Behind one stack he glimpsed three sailors throwing dice. Farther on the fishwives were crying the day\u2019s catch, and a boy was beating time on a drum as a shabby old bear danced in a circle for a ring of river runners. Two spearmen had been posted at the Seal Gate, with the badge of House Manderly upon their breasts, but they were too intent on flirting with a dockside whore to pay Davos any mind. The gate was open, the portcullis raised. He joined the traffic passing through.\nInside was a cobbled square with a fountain at its center. A stone merman rose from its waters, twenty feet tall from tail to crown. His curly beard was green and white with lichen, and one of the prongs of his trident had broken off before Davos had been born, yet somehow he still managed to impress. Old Fishfoot was what the locals called him. The square was named for some dead lord, but no one ever called it anything but Fishfoot Yard.\nThe Yard was teeming this afternoon. A woman was washing her smallclothes in Fishfoot\u2019s fountain and hanging them off his trident to dry. Beneath the arches of the peddler\u2019s colonnade the scribes and money changers had set up for business, along with a hedge wizard, an herb woman, and a very bad juggler. A man was selling apples from a barrow, and a woman was offering herring with chopped onions. Chickens and children were everywhere underfoot. The huge oak-and-iron doors of the Old Mint had always been closed when Davos had been in Fishfoot Yard before, but today they stood open. Inside he glimpsed hundreds of women, children, and old men, huddled on the floor on piles of furs. Some had little cookfires going.\nDavos stopped beneath the colonnade and traded a halfpenny for an apple. \u201cAre people living in the Old Mint?\u201d he asked the apple seller.\n\u201cThem as have no other place to live. Smallfolk from up the White Knife, most o\u2019 them. Hornwood\u2019s people too. With that Bastard o\u2019 Bolton running loose, they all want to be inside the walls. I don\u2019t know what his lordship means to do with all o\u2019 them. Most turned up with no more\u2019n the rags on their backs.\u201d\nDavos felt a pang of guilt. They came here for refuge, to a city untouched by the fighting, and here I turn up to drag them back into the war. He took a bite of the apple and felt guilty about that as well. \u201cHow do they eat?\u201d\nThe apple seller shrugged. \u201cSome beg. Some steal. Lots o\u2019 young girls taking up the trade, the way girls always do when it\u2019s all they got to sell. Any boy stands five feet tall can find a place in his lordship\u2019s barracks, long as he can hold a spear.\u201d\nHe\u2019s raising men, then. That might be good\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or bad, depending. The apple was dry and mealy, but Davos made himself take another bite. \u201cDoes Lord Wyman mean to join the Bastard?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the apple seller, \u201cthe next time his lordship comes down here hunkering for an apple, I\u2019ll be sure and ask him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard his daughter was to wed some Frey.\u201d\n\u201cHis granddaughter. I heard that too, but his lordship forgot t\u2019 invite me to the wedding. Here, you going to finish that? I\u2019ll take the rest back. Them seeds is good.\u201d\nDavos tossed him back the core. A bad apple, but it was worth half a penny to learn that Manderly is raising men. He made his way around Old Fishfoot, past where a young girl was selling cups of fresh milk from her nanny goat. He was remembering more of the city now that he was here. Down past where Old Fishfoot\u2019s trident pointed was an alley where they sold fried cod, crisp and golden brown outside and flaky white within. Over there was a brothel, cleaner than most, where a sailor could enjoy a woman without fear of being robbed or killed. Off the other way, in one of those houses that clung to the walls of the Wolf\u2019s Den like barnacles to an old hull, there used to be a brewhouse where they made a black beer so thick and tasty that a cask of it could fetch as much as Arbor gold in Braavos and the Port of Ibben, provided the locals left the brewer any to sell.\nIt was wine he wanted, though\u2014sour, dark, and dismal. He strolled across the yard and down a flight of steps, to a winesink called the Lazy Eel, underneath a warehouse full of sheepskins. Back in his smuggling days, the Eel had been renowned for offering the oldest whores and vilest wine in White Harbor, along with meat pies full of lard and gristle that were inedible on their best days and poisonous on their worst. With fare like that, most locals shunned the place, leaving it for sailors who did not know any better. You never saw a city guardsman down in the Lazy Eel, or a customs officer.\nSome things never change. Inside the Eel, time stood still. The barrel-vaulted ceiling was stained black with soot, the floor was hard-packed earth, the air smelled of smoke and spoiled meat and stale vomit. The fat tallow candles on the tables gave off more smoke than light, and the wine that Davos ordered looked more brown than red in the gloom. Four whores were seated near the door, drinking. One gave him a hopeful smile as he entered. When Davos shook his head, the woman said something that made her companions laugh. After that none of them paid him any mind.\nAside from the whores and the proprietor, Davos had the Eel to himself. The cellar was large, full of nooks and shadowed alcoves where a man could be alone. He took his wine to one of them and sat with his back to a wall to wait.\nBefore long, he found himself staring at the hearth. The red woman could see the future in the fire, but all that Davos Seaworth ever saw were the shadows of the past: the burning ships, the fiery chain, the green shadows flashing across the belly of the clouds, the Red Keep brooding over all. Davos was a simple man, raised up by chance and war and Stannis. He did not understand why the gods would take four lads as young and strong as his sons, yet spare their weary father. Some nights he thought he had been left to rescue Edric Storm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but by now King Robert\u2019s bastard boy was safe in the Stepstones, yet Davos still remained. Do the gods have some other task for me? he wondered. If so, White Harbor may be some part of it. He tried the wine, then poured half his cup onto the floor beside his foot.\nAs dusk fell outside, the benches at the Eel began to fill with sailors. Davos called to the proprietor for another cup. When he brought it, he brought him a candle too. \u201cYou want food?\u201d the man asked. \u201cWe got meat pies.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of meat is in them?\u201d\n\u201cThe usual kind. It\u2019s good.\u201d\nThe whores laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s grey, he means,\u201d one said.\n\u201cShut your bloody yap. You eat them.\u201d\n\u201cI eat all kinds o\u2019 shit. Don\u2019t mean I like it.\u201d\nDavos blew the candle out as soon as the proprietor moved off, and sat back in the shadows. Seamen were the worst gossips in the world when the wine was flowing, even wine as cheap as this. All he need do was listen.\nMost of what he heard he\u2019d learned in Sisterton, from Lord Godric or the denizens of the Belly of the Whale. Tywin Lannister was dead, butchered by his dwarf son; his corpse had stunk so badly that no one had been able to enter the Great Sept of Baelor for days afterward; the Lady of the Eyrie had been murdered by a singer; Littlefinger ruled the Vale now, but Bronze Yohn Royce had sworn to bring him down; Balon Greyjoy had died as well, and his brothers were fighting for the Seastone Chair; Sandor Clegane had turned outlaw and was plundering and killing in the lands along the Trident; Myr and Lys and Tyrosh were embroiled in another war; a slave revolt was raging in the east.\nOther tidings were of greater interest. Robett Glover was in the city and had been trying to raise men, with little success. Lord Manderly had turned a deaf ear to his pleas. White Harbor was weary of war, he was reported to have said. That was bad. The Ryswells and the Dustins had surprised the ironmen on the Fever River and put their longships to the torch. That was worse. And now the Bastard of Bolton was riding south with Hother Umber to join them for an attack on Moat Cailin. \u201cThe Whoresbane his own self,\u201d claimed a riverman who\u2019d just brought a load of hides and timber down the White Knife, \u201cwith three hundred spearmen and a hundred archers. Some Hornwood men have joined them, and Cerwyns too.\u201d That was worst of all.\n\u201cLord Wyman best send some men to fight if he knows what\u2019s good for him,\u201d said the old fellow at the end of the table. \u201cLord Roose, he\u2019s the Warden now. White Harbor\u2019s honor bound to answer his summons.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did any Bolton ever know o\u2019 honor?\u201d said the Eel\u2019s proprietor as he filled their cups with more brown wine.\n\u201cLord Wyman won\u2019t go no place. He\u2019s too bloody fat.\u201d\n\u201cI heard how he was ailing. All he does is sleep and weep, they say. He\u2019s too sick to get out o\u2019 his bed most days.\u201d\n\u201cToo fat, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cFat or thin\u2019s got naught to do with it,\u201d said the Eel\u2019s proprietor. \u201cThe lions got his son.\u201d\nNo one spoke of King Stannis. No one even seemed to know that His Grace had come north to help defend the Wall. Wildlings and wights and giants had been all the talk at Eastwatch, but here no one seemed to be giving them so much as a thought.\nDavos leaned into the firelight. \u201cI thought the Freys killed his son. That\u2019s what we heard in Sisterton.\u201d\n\u201cThey killed Ser Wendel,\u201d said the proprietor. \u201cHis bones are resting in the Snowy Sept with candles all around them, if you want to have a look. Ser Wylis, though, he\u2019s still a captive.\u201d\nWorse and worse. He had known that Lord Wyman had two sons, but he\u2019d thought that both of them were dead. If the Iron Throne has a hostage\u00a0\u2026 Davos had fathered seven sons himself, and lost four on the Blackwater. He knew he would do whatever gods or men required of him to protect the other three. Steffon and Stannis were thousands of leagues from the fighting and safe from harm, but Devan was at Castle Black, a squire to the king. The king whose cause may rise or fall with White Harbor.\nHis fellow drinkers were talking about dragons now. \u201cYou\u2019re bloody mad,\u201d said an oarsman off Storm Dancer. \u201cThe Beggar King\u2019s been dead for years. Some Dothraki horselord cut his head off.\u201d\n\u201cSo they tell us,\u201d said the old fellow. \u201cMight be they\u2019re lying, though. He died half a world away, if he died at all. Who\u2019s to say? If a king wanted me dead, might be I\u2019d oblige him and pretend to be a corpse. None of us has ever seen his body.\u201d\n\u201cI never saw Joffrey\u2019s corpse, nor Robert\u2019s,\u201d growled the Eel\u2019s proprietor. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re all alive as well. Maybe Baelor the Blessed\u2019s just been having him a little nap all these years.\u201d\nThe old fellow made a face. \u201cPrince Viserys weren\u2019t the only dragon, were he? Are we sure they killed Prince Rhaegar\u2019s son? A babe, he was.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t there some princess too?\u201d asked a whore. She was the same one who\u2019d said the meat was grey.\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said the old fellow. \u201cOne was Rhaegar\u2019s daughter, t\u2019other was his sister.\u201d\n\u201cDaena,\u201d said the riverman. \u201cThat was the sister. Daena of Dragonstone. Or was it Daera?\u201d\n\u201cDaena was old King Baelor\u2019s wife,\u201d said the oarsman. \u201cI rowed on a ship named for her once. The Princess Daena.\u201d\n\u201cIf she was a king\u2019s wife, she\u2019d be a queen.\u201d\n\u201cBaelor never had a queen. He was holy.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mean he never wed his sister,\u201d said the whore. \u201cHe just never bedded her, is all. When they made him king, he locked her up in a tower. His other sisters too. There was three.\u201d\n\u201cDaenela,\u201d the proprietor said loudly. \u201cThat was her name. The Mad King\u2019s daughter, I mean, not Baelor\u2019s bloody wife.\u201d\n\u201cDaenerys,\u201d Davos said. \u201cShe was named for the Daenerys who wed the Prince of Dorne during the reign of Daeron the Second. I don\u2019t know what became of her.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said the man who\u2019d started all the talk of dragons, a Braavosi oarsman in a somber woolen jack. \u201cWhen we were down to Pentos we moored beside a trader called the Sloe-Eyed Maid, and I got to drinking with her captain\u2019s steward. He told me a pretty tale about some slip of a girl who come aboard in Qarth, to try and book passage back to Westeros for her and three dragons. Silver hair she had, and purple eyes. \u2018I took her to the captain my own self,\u2019 this steward swore to me, \u2018but he wasn\u2019t having none of that. There\u2019s more profit in cloves and saffron, he tells me, and spices won\u2019t set fire to your sails.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nLaughter swept the cellar. Davos did not join in. He knew what had befallen the Sloe-Eyed Maid. The gods were cruel to let a man sail across half the world, then send him chasing a false light when he was almost home. That captain was a bolder man than me, he thought, as he made his way to the door. One voyage to the east, and a man could live as rich as a lord until the end of his days. When he\u2019d been younger, Davos had dreamed of making such voyages himself, but the years went dancing by like moths around a flame, and somehow the time had never been quite right. One day, he told himself. One day when the war is done and King Stannis sits the Iron Throne and has no more need of onion knights. I\u2019ll take Devan with me. Steff and Stanny too if they\u2019re old enough. We\u2019ll see these dragons and all the wonders of the world.\nOutside the wind was gusting, making the flames shiver in the oil lamps that lit the yard. It had grown colder since the sun went down, but Davos remembered Eastwatch, and how the wind would come screaming off the Wall at night, knifing through even the warmest cloak to freeze a man\u2019s blood right in his veins. White Harbor was a warm bath by comparison.\nThere were other places he might get his ears filled: an inn famous for its lamprey pies, the alehouse where the wool factors and the customs men did their drinking, a mummer\u2019s hall where bawdy entertainments could be had for a few pennies. But Davos felt that he had heard enough. I\u2019ve come too late. Old instinct made him reach for his chest, where once he\u2019d kept his fingerbones in a little sack on a leather thong. There was nothing there. He had lost his luck in the fires of the Blackwater, when he\u2019d lost his ship and sons.\nWhat must I do now? He pulled his mantle tighter. Do I climb the hill and present myself at the gates of the New Castle, to make a futile plea? Return to Sisterton? Make my way back to Marya and my boys? Buy a horse and ride the kingsroad, to tell Stannis that he has no friends in White Harbor, and no hope?\nQueen Selyse had feasted Salla and his captains, the night before the fleet had set sail. Cotter Pyke had joined them, and four other high officers of the Night\u2019s Watch. Princess Shireen had been allowed to attend as well. As the salmon was being served, Ser Axell Florent had entertained the table with the tale of a Targaryen princeling who kept an ape as a pet. This prince liked to dress the creature in his dead son\u2019s clothes and pretend he was a child, Ser Axell claimed, and from time to time he would propose marriages for him. The lords so honored always declined politely, but of course they did decline. \u201cEven dressed in silk and velvet, an ape remains an ape,\u201d Ser Axell said. \u201cA wiser prince would have known that you cannot send an ape to do a man\u2019s work.\u201d The queen\u2019s men laughed, and several grinned at Davos. I am no ape, he\u2019d thought. I am as much a lord as you, and a better man. But the memory still stung.\nThe Seal Gate had been closed for the night. Davos would not be able to return to the Merry Midwife till dawn. He was here for the night. He gazed up at Old Fishfoot with his broken trident. I have come through rain and wrack and storm. I will not go back without doing what I came for, no matter how hopeless it may seem. He might have lost his fingers and his luck, but he was no ape in velvet. He was a King\u2019s Hand.\nCastle Stair was a street with steps, a broad white stone way that led up from the Wolf\u2019s Den by the water to the New Castle on its hill. Marble mermaids lit the way as Davos climbed, bowls of burning whale oil cradled in their arms. When he reached the top, he turned to look behind him. From here he could see down into the harbors. Both of them. Behind the jetty wall, the inner harbor was crowded with war galleys. Davos counted twenty-three. Lord Wyman was a fat man, but not an idle one, it seemed.\nThe gates of the New Castle had been closed, but a postern opened when he shouted, and a guard emerged to ask his business. Davos showed him the black and gold ribbon that bore the royal seals. \u201cI need to see Lord Manderly at once,\u201d he said. \u201cMy business is with him, and him alone.\u201d",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe dancers shimmered, their sleek shaved bodies covered with a fine sheen of oil. Blazing torches whirled from hand to hand to the beat of drums and the trilling of a flute. Whenever two torches crossed in the air, a naked girl leapt between them, spinning. The torchlight shone off oiled limbs and breasts and buttocks.\nThe three men were erect. The sight of their arousal was arousing, though Daenerys Targaryen found it comical as well. The men were all of a height, with long legs and flat bellies, every muscle as sharply etched as if it had been chiseled out of stone. Even their faces looked the same, somehow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0which was passing strange, since one had skin as dark as ebony, while the second was as pale as milk, and the third gleamed like burnished copper.\nAre they meant to inflame me? Dany stirred amongst her silken cushions. Against the pillars her Unsullied stood like statues in their spiked caps, their smooth faces expressionless. Not so the whole men. Reznak mo Reznak\u2019s mouth was open, and his lips glistened wetly as he watched. Hizdahr zo Loraq was saying something to the man beside him, yet all the time his eyes were on the dancing girls. The Shavepate\u2019s ugly, oily face was as stern as ever, but he missed nothing.\nIt was harder to know what her honored guest was dreaming. The pale, lean, hawk-faced man who shared her high table was resplendent in robes of maroon silk and cloth-of-gold, his bald head shining in the torchlight as he devoured a fig with small, precise, elegant bites. Opals winked along the nose of Xaro Xhoan Daxos as his head turned to follow the dancers.\nIn his honor Daenerys had donned a Qartheen gown, a sheer confection of violet samite cut so as to leave her left breast bare. Her silver-gold hair brushed lightly over her shoulder, falling almost to her nipple. Half the men in the hall had stolen glances at her, but not Xaro. It was the same in Qarth. She could not sway the merchant prince that way. Sway him I must, however. He had come from Qarth upon the galleas Silken Cloud with thirteen galleys sailing attendance, his fleet an answered prayer. Meereen\u2019s trade had dwindled away to nothing since she had ended slavery, but Xaro had the power to restore it.\nAs the drums reached a crescendo, three of the girls leapt above the flames, spinning in the air. The male dancers caught them about the waists and slid them down onto their members. Dany watched as the women arched their backs and coiled their legs around their partners while the flutes wept and the men thrust in time to the music. She had seen the act of love before; the Dothraki mated as openly as their mares and stallions. This was the first time she had seen lust put to music, though.\nHer face was warm. The wine, she told herself. Yet somehow she found herself thinking of Daario Naharis. His messenger had come that morning. The Stormcrows were returning from Lhazar. Her captain was riding back to her, bringing her the friendship of the Lamb Men. Food and trade, she reminded herself. He did not fail me, nor will he. Daario will help me save my city. The queen longed to see his face, to stroke his three-pronged beard, to tell him her troubles\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the Stormcrows were still many days away, beyond the Khyzai Pass, and she had a realm to rule.\nSmoke hung between the purple pillars. The dancers knelt, heads bowed. \u201cYou were splendid,\u201d Dany told them. \u201cSeldom have I seen such grace, such beauty.\u201d She beckoned to Reznak mo Reznak, and the seneschal scurried to her side. Beads of sweat dotted his bald, wrinkled head. \u201cEscort our guests to the baths, that they may refresh themselves, and bring them food and drink.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall be my great honor, Magnificence.\u201d\nDaenerys held out her cup for Irri to refill. The wine was sweet and strong, redolent with the smell of eastern spices, much superior to the thin Ghiscari wines that had filled her cup of late. Xaro perused the fruits on the platter Jhiqui offered him and chose a persimmon. Its orange skin matched the color of the coral in his nose. He took a bite and pursed his lips. \u201cTart.\u201d\n\u201cWould my lord prefer something sweeter?\u201d\n\u201cSweetness cloys. Tart fruit and tart women give life its savor.\u201d Xaro took another bite, chewed, swallowed. \u201cDaenerys, sweet queen, I cannot tell you what pleasure it gives me to bask once more in your presence. A child departed Qarth, as lost as she was lovely. I feared she was sailing to her doom, yet now I find her here enthroned, mistress of an ancient city, surrounded by a mighty host that she raised up out of dreams.\u201d\nNo, she thought, out of blood and fire. \u201cI am glad you came to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d I will not trust you, but I need you. I need your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.\nFor centuries Meereen and her sister cities Yunkai and Astapor had been the linchpins of the slave trade, the place where Dothraki khals and the corsairs of the Basilisk Isles sold their captives and the rest of the world came to buy. Without slaves, Meereen had little to offer traders. Copper was plentiful in the Ghiscari hills, but the metal was not as valuable as it had been when bronze ruled the world. The cedars that had once grown tall along the coast grew no more, felled by the axes of the Old Empire or consumed by dragonfire when Ghis made war against Valyria. Once the trees had gone, the soil baked beneath the hot sun and blew away in thick red clouds. \u201cIt was these calamities that transformed my people into slavers,\u201d Galazza Galare had told her, at the Temple of the Graces. And I am the calamity that will change these slavers back into people, Dany had sworn to herself.\n\u201cI had to come,\u201d said Xaro in a languid tone. \u201cEven far away in Qarth, fearful tales had reached my ears. I wept to hear them. It is said that your enemies have promised wealth and glory and a hundred virgin slave girls to any man who slays you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sons of the Harpy.\u201d How does he know that? \u201cThey scrawl on walls by night and cut the throats of honest freedmen as they sleep. When the sun comes up they hide like roaches. They fear my Brazen Beasts.\u201d Skahaz mo Kandaq had given her the new watch she had asked for, made up in equal numbers of freedmen and shavepate Meereenese. They walked the streets both day and night, in dark hoods and brazen masks. The Sons of the Harpy had promised grisly death to any traitor who dared serve the dragon queen, and to their kith and kin as well, so the Shavepate\u2019s men went about as jackals, owls, and other beasts, keeping their true faces hidden. \u201cI might have cause to fear the Sons if they saw me wandering alone through the streets, but only if it was night and I was naked and unarmed. They are craven creatures.\u201d\n\u201cA craven\u2019s knife can slay a queen as easily as a hero\u2019s. I would sleep more soundly if I knew my heart\u2019s delight had kept her fierce horselords close around her. In Qarth, you had three bloodriders who never left your side. Wherever have they gone?\u201d\n\u201cAggo, Jhoqo, and Rakharo still serve me.\u201d He is playing games with me. Dany could play as well. \u201cI am only a young girl and know little of such things, but older, wiser men tell me that to hold Meereen I must control its hinterlands, all the land west of Lhazar as far south as the Yunkish hills.\u201d\n\u201cYour hinterlands are not precious to me. Your person is. Should any ill befall you, this world would lose its savor.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord is good to care so much, but I am well protected.\u201d Dany gestured toward where Barristan Selmy stood with one hand resting on his sword hilt. \u201cBarristan the Bold, they call him. Twice he has saved me from assassins.\u201d\nXaro gave Selmy a cursory inspection. \u201cBarristan the Old, did you say? Your bear knight was younger, and devoted to you.\u201d\n\u201cI do not wish to speak of Jorah Mormont.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure. The man was coarse and hairy.\u201d The merchant prince leaned across the table. \u201cLet us speak instead of love, of dreams and desire and Daenerys, the fairest woman in this world. I am drunk with the sight of you.\u201d\nShe was no stranger to the overblown courtesies of Qarth. \u201cIf you are drunk, blame the wine.\u201d\n\u201cNo wine is half so intoxicating as your beauty. My manse has seemed as empty as a tomb since Daenerys departed, and all the pleasures of the Queen of Cities have been as ashes in my mouth. Why did you abandon me?\u201d\nI was hounded from your city in fear for my life. \u201cIt was time. Qarth wished me gone.\u201d\n\u201cWho? The Pureborn? They have water in their veins. The Spicers? There are curds between their ears. And the Undying are all dead. You should have taken me to husband. I am almost certain that I asked you for your hand. Begged you, even.\u201d\n\u201cOnly half a hundred times,\u201d Dany teased. \u201cYou gave up too easily, my lord. For I must marry, all agree.\u201d\n\u201cA khaleesi must have a khal,\u201d said Irri, as she filled the queen\u2019s cup once again. \u201cThis is known.\u201d\n\u201cShall I ask again?\u201d wondered Xaro. \u201cNo, I know that smile. It is a cruel queen who dices with men\u2019s hearts. Humble merchants like myself are no more than stones beneath your jeweled sandals.\u201d A single tear ran slowly down his pale white cheek.\nDany knew him too well to be moved. Qartheen men could weep at will. \u201cOh, stop that.\u201d She took a cherry from the bowl on the table and threw it at his nose. \u201cI may be a young girl, but I am not so foolish as to wed a man who finds a fruit platter more enticing than my breast. I saw which dancers you were watching.\u201d\nXaro wiped away his tear. \u201cThe same ones Your Grace was following, I believe. You see, we are alike. If you will not take me for your husband, I am content to be your slave.\u201d\n\u201cI want no slave. I free you.\u201d His jeweled nose made a tempting target. This time Dany threw an apricot at him.\nXaro caught it in the air and took a bite. \u201cWhence came this madness? Should I count myself fortunate that you did not free my own slaves when you were my guest in Qarth?\u201d\nI was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen, Dany thought, and all you wanted were my dragons. \u201cYour slaves seemed well treated and content. It was not till Astapor that my eyes were opened. Do you know how Unsullied are made and trained?\u201d\n\u201cCruelly, I have no doubt. When a smith makes a sword, he thrusts the blade into the fire, beats on it with a hammer, then plunges it into iced water to temper the steel. If you would savor the sweet taste of the fruit, you must water the tree.\u201d\n\u201cThis tree has been watered with blood.\u201d\n\u201cHow else, to grow a soldier? Your Radiance enjoyed my dancers. Would it surprise you to know that they are slaves, bred and trained in Yunkai? They have been dancing since they were old enough to walk. How else to achieve such perfection?\u201d He took a swallow of his wine. \u201cThey are expert in all the erotic arts as well. I had thought to make Your Grace a gift of them.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d Dany was unsurprised. \u201cI shall free them.\u201d\nThat made him wince. \u201cAnd what would they do with freedom? As well give a fish a suit of mail. They were made to dance.\u201d\n\u201cMade by who? Their masters? Perhaps your dancers would sooner build or bake or farm. Have you asked them?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps your elephants would sooner be nightingales. Instead of sweet song, Meereen\u2019s nights would be filled with thunderous trumpetings, and your trees would shatter beneath the weight of great grey birds.\u201d Xaro sighed. \u201cDaenerys, my delight, beneath that sweet young breast beats a tender heart\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but take counsel from an older, wiser head. Things are not always as they seem. Much that may seem evil can be good. Consider rain.\u201d\n\u201cRain?\u201d Does he take me for a fool, or just a child?\n\u201cWe curse the rain when it falls upon our heads, yet without it we should starve. The world needs rain\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and slaves. You make a face, but it is true. Consider Qarth. In art, music, magic, trade, all that makes us more than beasts, Qarth sits above the rest of mankind as you sit at the summit of this pyramid\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but below, in place of bricks, the magnificence that is the Queen of Cities rests upon the backs of slaves. Ask yourself, if all men must grub in the dirt for food, how shall any man lift his eyes to contemplate the stars? If each of us must break his back to build a hovel, who shall raise the temples to glorify the gods? For some men to be great, others must be enslaved.\u201d\nHe was too eloquent for her. Dany had no answer for him, only the raw feeling in her belly. \u201cSlavery is not the same as rain,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI have been rained on and I have been sold. It is not the same. No man wants to be owned.\u201d\nXaro gave a languid shrug. \u201cAs it happens, when I came ashore in your sweet city, I chanced to see upon the riverbank a man who had once been a guest in my manse, a merchant who dealt in rare spices and choice wines. He was naked from the waist up, red and peeling, and seemed to be digging a hole.\u201d\n\u201cNot a hole. A ditch, to bring water from the river to the fields. We mean to plant beans. The beanfields must have water.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of my old friend to help with the digging. And how very unlike him. Is it possible he was given no choice in the matter? No, surely not. You have no slaves in Meereen.\u201d\nDany flushed. \u201cYour friend is being paid with food and shelter. I cannot give him back his wealth. Meereen needs beans more than it needs rare spices, and beans require water.\u201d\n\u201cWould you set my dancers to digging ditches as well? Sweet queen, when he saw me, my old friend fell to his knees and begged me to buy him as a slave and take him back to Qarth.\u201d\nShe felt as if he\u2019d slapped her. \u201cBuy him, then.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please you. I know it will please him.\u201d He put his hand upon her arm. \u201cThere are truths only a friend may tell you. I helped you when you came to Qarth a beggar, and I have crossed long leagues and stormy seas to help you once again. Is there some place where we might speak frankly?\u201d\nDany could feel the warmth of his fingers. He was warm in Qarth as well, she recalled, until the day he had no more use for me. She rose to her feet. \u201cCome,\u201d she said, and Xaro followed her through the pillars, to the wide marble steps that led up to her private chambers at the apex of the pyramid.\n\u201cOh most beautiful of women,\u201d Xaro said, as they began to climb, \u201cthere are footsteps behind us. We are followed.\u201d\n\u201cMy old knight does not frighten you, surely? Ser Barristan is sworn to keep my secrets.\u201d\nShe took him out onto the terrace that overlooked the city. A full moon swam in the black sky above Meereen. \u201cShall we walk?\u201d Dany slipped her arm through his. The air was heavy with the scent of night-blooming flowers. \u201cYou spoke of help. Trade with me, then. Meereen has salt to sell, and wine\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGhiscari wine?\u201d Xaro made a sour face. \u201cThe sea provides all the salt that Qarth requires, but I would gladly take as many olives as you cared to sell me. Olive oil as well.\u201d\n\u201cI have none to offer. The slavers burned the trees.\u201d Olives had been grown along the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay for centuries; but the Meereenese had put their ancient groves to the torch as Dany\u2019s host advanced on them, leaving her to cross a blackened wasteland. \u201cWe are replanting, but it takes seven years before an olive tree begins to bear, and thirty years before it can truly be called productive. What of copper?\u201d\n\u201cA pretty metal, but fickle as a woman. Gold, now\u00a0\u2026\u00a0gold is sincere. Qarth will gladly give you gold\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for slaves.\u201d\n\u201cMeereen is a free city of free men.\u201d\n\u201cA poor city that once was rich. A hungry city that once was fat. A bloody city that once was peaceful.\u201d\nHis accusations stung. There was too much truth in them. \u201cMeereen will be rich and fat and peaceful once again, and free as well. Go to the Dothraki if you must have slaves.\u201d\n\u201cDothraki make slaves, Ghiscari train them. And to reach Qarth, the horselords must needs drive their captives across the red waste. Hundreds would die, if not thousands\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and many horses too, which is why no khal will risk it. And there is this: Qarth wants no khalasars seething round our walls. The stench of all those horses\u00a0\u2026\u00a0meaning no offense, Khaleesi.\u201d\n\u201cA horse has an honest smell. That is more than can be said of some great lords and merchant princes.\u201d\nXaro took no notice of the sally. \u201cDaenerys, let me be honest with you, as befits a friend. You will not make Meereen rich and fat and peaceful. You will only bring it to destruction, as you did Astapor. You are aware that there was battle joined at the Horns of Hazzat? The Butcher King has fled back to his palace, his new Unsullied running at his heels.\u201d\n\u201cThis is known.\u201d Brown Ben Plumm had sent back word of the battle from the field. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i have bought themselves new sellswords, and two legions from New Ghis fought beside them.\u201d\n\u201cTwo will soon become four, then ten. And Yunkish envoys have been sent to Myr and Volantis to hire more blades. The Company of the Cat, the Long Lances, the Windblown. Some say that the Wise Masters have bought the Golden Company as well.\u201d\nHer brother Viserys had once feasted the captains of the Golden Company, in hopes they might take up his cause. They ate his food and heard his pleas and laughed at him. Dany had only been a little girl, but she remembered. \u201cI have sellswords too.\u201d\n\u201cTwo companies. The Yunkai\u2019i will send twenty against you if they must. And when they march, they will not march alone. Tolos and Mantarys have agreed to an alliance.\u201d\nThat was ill news, if true. Daenerys had sent missions to Tolos and Mantarys, hoping to find new friends to the west to balance the enmity of Yunkai to the south. Her envoys had not returned. \u201cMeereen has made alliance with Lhazar.\u201d\nThat only made him chuckle. \u201cThe Dothraki horselords call the Lhazarene the Lamb Men. When you shear them, all they do is bleat. They are not a martial people.\u201d\nEven a sheepish friend is better than none. \u201cThe Wise Masters should follow their example. I spared Yunkai before, but I will not make that mistake again. If they should dare attack me, this time I shall raze their Yellow City to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cAnd whilst you are razing Yunkai, my sweet, Meereen shall rise behind you. Do not close your eyes to your peril, Daenerys. Your eunuchs are fine soldiers, but they are too few to match the hosts that Yunkai will send against you, once Astapor has fallen.\u201d\n\u201cMy freedman\u2014\u201d Dany started.\n\u201cBedslaves, barbers, and brickmakers win no battles.\u201d\nHe was wrong in that, she hoped. The freedmen had been a rabble once, but she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded Grey Worm to make them into soldiers. Let him think what he will. \u201cHave you forgotten? I have dragons.\u201d\n\u201cDo you? In Qarth, you were seldom seen without a dragon on your shoulder\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet now that shapely shoulder is as fair and bare as your sweet breast, I observe.\u201d\n\u201cMy dragons have grown, my shoulders have not. They range far afield, hunting.\u201d Hazzea, forgive me. She wondered how much Xaro knew, what whispers he had heard. \u201cAsk the Good Masters of Astapor about my dragons if you doubt them.\u201d I saw a slaver\u2019s eyes melt and go running down his cheeks. \u201cTell me true, old friend, why did you seek me out if not to trade?\u201d\n\u201cTo bring a gift, for the queen of my heart.\u201d\n\u201cSay on.\u201d What trap is this, now?\n\u201cThe gift you begged of me in Qarth. Ships. There are thirteen galleys in the bay. Yours, if you will have them. I have brought you a fleet, to carry you home to Westeros.\u201d\nA fleet. It was more than she could hope for, so of course it made her wary. In Qarth, Xaro had offered her thirty ships\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for a dragon. \u201cAnd what price do you ask for these ships?\u201d\n\u201cNone. I no longer lust for dragons. I saw their work at Astapor on my way here, when my Silken Cloud put in for water. The ships are yours, sweet queen. Thirteen galleys, and men to pull the oars.\u201d\nThirteen. To be sure. Xaro was one of the Thirteen. No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow members to give up one ship. She knew the merchant prince too well to think that he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships. \u201cI must consider this. May I inspect these ships?\u201d\n\u201cYou have grown suspicious, Daenerys.\u201d\nAlways. \u201cI have grown wise, Xaro.\u201d\n\u201cInspect all you wish. When you are satisfied, swear to me that you shall return to Westeros forthwith, and the ships are yours. Swear by your dragons and your seven-faced god and the ashes of your fathers, and go.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I should decide to wait a year, or three?\u201d\nA mournful look crossed Xaro\u2019s face. \u201cThat would make me very sad, my sweet delight\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for young and strong as you now seem, you shall not live so long. Not here.\u201d\nHe offers the honeycomb with one hand and shows the whip with the other. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i are not so fearsome as all that.\u201d\n\u201cNot all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks, to seek for you in Pentos.\u201d\nDany was more amused than afraid. \u201cIt is good I turned aside, then. Pentos is half a world from Meereen.\u201d\n\u201cThis is so,\u201d he allowed, \u201cyet soon or late word must reach them of the dragon queen of Slaver\u2019s Bay.\u201d\n\u201cIs that meant to frighten me? I lived in fear for fourteen years, my lord. I woke afraid each morning and went to sleep afraid each night\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but my fears were burned away the day I came forth from the fire. Only one thing frightens me now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is it that you fear, sweet queen?\u201d\n\u201cI am only a foolish young girl.\u201d Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. \u201cBut not so foolish as to tell you that. My men shall look at these ships. Then you shall have my answer.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d He touched her bare breast lightly, and whispered, \u201cLet me stay and help persuade you.\u201d\nFor a moment she was tempted. Perhaps the dancers had stirred her after all. I could close my eyes and pretend that he was Daario. A dream Daario would be safer than the real one. But she pushed the thought aside. \u201cNo, my lord. I thank you, but no.\u201d Dany slipped from his arms. \u201cSome other night, perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cSome other night.\u201d His mouth was sad, but his eyes seemed more relieved than disappointed.\nIf I were a dragon, I could fly to Westeros, she thought when he was gone. I would have no need of Xaro or his ships. Dany wondered how many men thirteen galleys could hold. It had taken three to carry her and her khalasar from Qarth to Astapor, but that was before she had acquired eight thousand Unsullied, a thousand sellswords, and a vast horde of freedmen. And the dragons, what am I to do with them? \u201cDrogon,\u201d she whispered softly, \u201cwhere are you?\u201d For a moment she could almost see him sweeping across the sky, his black wings swallowing the stars.\nShe turned her back upon the night, to where Barristan Selmy stood silent in the shadows. \u201cMy brother once told me a Westerosi riddle. Who listens to everything yet hears nothing?\u201d\n\u201cA knight of the Kingsguard.\u201d Selmy\u2019s voice was solemn.\n\u201cYou heard Xaro make his offer?\u201d\n\u201cI did, Your Grace.\u201d The old knight took pains not to look at her bare breast as he spoke to her.\nSer Jorah would not turn his eyes away. He loved me as a woman, where Ser Barristan loves me only as his queen. Mormont had been an informer, reporting to her enemies in Westeros, yet he had given her good counsel too. \u201cWhat do you think of it? Of him?\u201d\n\u201cOf him, little and less. These ships, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Your Grace, with these ships we might be home before year\u2019s end.\u201d\nDany had never known a home. In Braavos, there had been a house with a red door, but that was all. \u201cBeware of Qartheen bearing gifts, especially merchants of the Thirteen. There is some trap here. Perhaps these ships are rotten, or\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf they were so unseaworthy, they could not have crossed the sea from Qarth,\u201d Ser Barristan pointed out, \u201cbut Your Grace was wise to insist upon inspection. I will take Admiral Groleo to the galleys at first light with his captains and two score of his sailors. We can crawl over every inch of those ships.\u201d\nIt was good counsel. \u201cYes, make it so.\u201d Westeros. Home. But if she left, what would happen to her city? Meereen was never your city, her brother\u2019s voice seemed to whisper. Your cities are across the sea. Your Seven Kingdoms, where your enemies await you. You were born to serve them blood and fire.\nSer Barristan cleared his throat and said, \u201cThis warlock that the merchant spoke of\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPyat Pree.\u201d She tried to recall his face, but all she could see were his lips. The wine of the warlocks had turned them blue. Shade-of-the-evening, it was called. \u201cIf a warlock\u2019s spell could kill me, I would be dead by now. I left their palace all in ashes.\u201d Drogon saved me when they would have drained my life from me. Drogon burned them all.\n\u201cAs you say, Your Grace. Still. I will be watchful.\u201d\nShe kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI know you will. Come, walk me back down to the feast.\u201d\nThe next morning Dany woke as full of hope as she had been since first she came to Slaver\u2019s Bay. Daario would soon be at her side once more, and together they would sail for Westeros. For home. One of her young hostages brought her morning meal, a plump shy girl named Mezzara, whose father ruled the pyramid of Merreq, and Dany gave her a happy hug and thanked her with a kiss.\n\u201cXaro Xhoan Daxos has offered me thirteen galleys,\u201d she told Irri and Jhiqui as they were dressing her for court.\n\u201cThirteen is a bad number, Khaleesi,\u201d murmured Jhiqui, in the Dothraki tongue. \u201cIt is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d Irri agreed.\n\u201cThirty would be better,\u201d Daenerys agreed. \u201cThree hundred better still. But thirteen may suffice to carry us to Westeros.\u201d\nThe two Dothraki girls exchanged a look. \u201cThe poison water is accursed, Khaleesi,\u201d said Irri. \u201cHorses cannot drink it.\u201d\n\u201cI do not intend to drink it,\u201d Dany promised them.\nOnly four petitioners awaited her that morning. As ever, Lord Ghael was the first to present himself, looking even more wretched than usual. \u201cYour Radiance,\u201d he moaned, as he fell to the marble at her feet, \u201cthe armies of the Yunkai\u2019i descend on Astapor. I beg you, come south with all your strength!\u201d\n\u201cI warned your king that this war of his was folly,\u201d Dany reminded him. \u201cHe would not listen.\u201d\n\u201cGreat Cleon sought only to strike down the vile slavers of Yunkai.\u201d\n\u201cGreat Cleon is a slaver himself.\u201d\n\u201cI know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us in our hour of peril. Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls.\u201d\nAnd if I do, who will defend my walls? \u201cMany of my freedmen were slaves in Astapor. Perhaps some will wish to help defend your king. That is their choice, as free men. I gave Astapor its freedom. It is up to you to defend it.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all dead, then. You gave us death, not freedom.\u201d Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.\nStrong Belwas seized him by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard Ghael\u2019s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. \u201cNo one has ever died from spittle. Take him away.\u201d\nThey dragged him out feet first, leaving several broken teeth and a trail of blood behind. Dany would gladly have sent the rest of the petitioners away\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but she was still their queen, so she heard them out and did her best to give them justice.\nLate that afternoon Admiral Groleo and Ser Barristan returned from their inspection of the galleys. Dany assembled her council to hear them. Grey Worm was there for the Unsullied, Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts. In the absence of her bloodriders, a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo, squint-eyed and bowlegged, came to speak for her Dothraki. Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies she had formed\u2014Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields, Symon Stripeback of the Free Brothers, Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men. Reznak mo Reznak hovered at the queen\u2019s elbow, and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms crossed. Dany would not lack for counsel.\nGroleo had been a most unhappy man since they had broken up his ship to build the siege engines that won Meereen for her. Dany had tried to console him by naming him her lord admiral, but it was a hollow honor; the Meereenese fleet had sailed for Yunkai when Dany\u2019s host approached the city, so the old Pentoshi was an admiral without ships. Yet now he was smiling through his ragged salt-streaked beard in a way that the queen could scarce remember.\n\u201cThe ships are sound, then?\u201d she said, hoping.\n\u201cSound enough, Your Grace. They are old ships, aye, but most are well maintained. The hull of the Pureborn Princess is worm-eaten. I\u2019d not want to take her beyond the sight of land. The Narraqqa could stand a new rudder and lines, and the Banded Lizard has some cracked oars, but they will serve. The rowers are slaves, but if we offer them an honest oarsman\u2019s wage, most will stay with us. Rowing\u2019s all they know. Those who leave can be replaced from my own crews. It is a long hard voyage to Westeros, but these ships are sound enough to get us there, I\u2019d judge.\u201d\nReznak mo Reznak gave a piteous moan. \u201cThen it is true. Your Worship means to abandon us.\u201d He wrung his hands. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i will restore the Great Masters the instant you are gone, and we who have so faithfully served your cause will be put to the sword, our sweet wives and maiden daughters raped and enslaved.\u201d\n\u201cNot mine,\u201d grumbled Skahaz Shavepate. \u201cI will kill them first, with mine own hand.\u201d He slapped his sword hilt.\nDany felt as if he had slapped her face instead. \u201cIf you fear what may follow when I leave, come with me to Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cWherever the Mother of Dragons goes, the Mother\u2019s Men will go as well,\u201d announced Marselen, Missandei\u2019s remaining brother.\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Symon Stripeback, named for the tangle of scars that ridged his back and shoulders, a reminder of the whippings he had suffered as a slave in Astapor. \u201cThirteen ships\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that\u2019s not enough. A hundred ships might not be enough.\u201d\n\u201cWooden horses are no good,\u201d objected Rommo, the old jaqqa rhan. \u201cDothraki will ride.\u201d\n\u201cThese ones could march overland along the shore,\u201d suggested Grey Worm. \u201cThe ships could keep pace and resupply the column.\u201d\n\u201cThat might serve until you reached the ruins of Bhorash,\u201d said the Shavepate. \u201cBeyond that, your ships would need to turn south past Tolos and the Isle of Cedars and sail around Valyria, whilst the foot continued on to Mantarys by the old dragon road.\u201d\n\u201cThe demon road, they call it now,\u201d said Mollono Yos Dob. The plump commander of the Stalwart Shields looked more like a scribe than a soldier, with his inky hands and heavy paunch, but he was as clever as they came. \u201cMany and more of us would die.\u201d\n\u201cThose left behind in Meereen would envy them their easy deaths,\u201d moaned Reznak. \u201cThey will make slaves of us, or throw us in the pits. All will be as it was, or worse.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is your courage?\u201d Ser Barristan lashed out. \u201cHer Grace freed you from your chains. It is for you to sharpen your swords and defend your own freedom when she leaves.\u201d\n\u201cBrave words, from one who means to sail into the sunset,\u201d Symon Stripeback snarled back. \u201cWill you look back at our dying?\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMagnificence\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour Worship\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEnough.\u201d Dany slapped the table. \u201cNo one will be left to die. You are all my people.\u201d Her dreams of home and love had blinded her. \u201cI will not abandon Meereen to the fate of Astapor. It grieves me to say so, but Westeros must wait.\u201d\nGroleo was aghast. \u201cWe must accept these ships. If we refuse this gift\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nSer Barristan went to one knee before her. \u201cMy queen, your realm has need of you. You are not wanted here, but in Westeros men will flock to your banners by the thousands, great lords and noble knights. \u2018She is come,\u2019 they will shout to one another, in glad voices. \u2018Prince Rhaegar\u2019s sister has come home at last.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cIf they love me so much, they will wait for me.\u201d Dany stood. \u201cReznak, summon Xaro Xhoan Daxos.\u201d\nShe received the merchant prince alone, seated on her bench of polished ebony, on the cushions Ser Barristan had brought her. Four Qartheen sailors accompanied him, bearing a rolled tapestry upon their shoulders. \u201cI have brought another gift for the queen of my heart,\u201d Xaro announced. \u201cIt has been in my family vaults since before the Doom that took Valyria.\u201d\nThe sailors unrolled the tapestry across the floor. It was old, dusty, faded\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and huge. Dany had to move to Xaro\u2019s side before the patterns became plain. \u201cA map? It is beautiful.\u201d It covered half the floor. The seas were blue, the lands were green, the mountains black and brown. Cities were shown as stars in gold or silver thread. There is no Smoking Sea, she realized. Valyria is not yet an island.\n\u201cThere you see Astapor, and Yunkai, and Meereen.\u201d Xaro pointed at three silver stars beside the blue of Slaver\u2019s Bay. \u201cWesteros is\u00a0\u2026\u00a0somewhere down there.\u201d His hand waved vaguely toward the far end of the hall. \u201cYou turned north when you should have continued south and west, across the Summer Sea, but with my gift you shall soon be back where you belong. Accept my galleys with a joyful heart, and bend your oars westward.\u201d\nWould that I could. \u201cMy lord, I will gladly have those ships, but I cannot give you the promise that you ask.\u201d She took his hand. \u201cGive me the galleys, and I swear that Qarth will have the friendship of Meereen until the stars go out. Let me trade with them, and you will have a good part of the profits.\u201d\nXaro\u2019s glad smile died upon his lips. \u201cWhat are you saying? Are you telling me you will not go?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot go.\u201d\nTears welled from his eyes, creeping down his nose, past emeralds, amethysts, and black diamonds. \u201cI told the Thirteen that you would heed my wisdom. It grieves me to learn that I was wrong. Take these ships and sail away, or you will surely die screaming. You cannot know how many enemies you have made.\u201d\nI know one stands before me now, weeping mummer\u2019s tears. The realization made her sad.\n\u201cWhen I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, \u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019 When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d\n\u201cI was a guest beneath your roof and ate of your meat and mead,\u201d she said. \u201cIn memory of all you did for me, I will forgive those words\u00a0\u2026\u00a0once\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but never presume to threaten me again.\u201d\n\u201cXaro Xhoan Daxos does not threaten. He promises.\u201d\nHer sadness turned to fury. \u201cAnd I promise you that if you are not gone before the sun comes up, we will learn how well a liar\u2019s tears can quench dragonfire. Leave me, Xaro. Quickly.\u201d\nHe went but left his world behind. Dany seated herself upon her bench again to gaze across the blue silk sea, toward distant Westeros. One day, she promised herself.\nThe next morning Xaro\u2019s galleas was gone, but the \u201cgift\u201d that he had brought her remained behind in Slaver\u2019s Bay. Long red streamers flew from the masts of the thirteen Qartheen galleys, writhing in the wind. And when Daenerys descended to hold court, a messenger from the ships awaited her. He spoke no word but laid at her feet a black satin pillow, upon which rested a single bloodstained glove.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Skahaz demanded. \u201cA bloody glove\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0means war,\u201d said the queen.",

      "content": "JON\nCareful of the rats, my lord.\u201d Dolorous Edd led Jon down the steps, a lantern in one hand. \u201cThey make an awful squeal if you step on them. My mother used to make a similar sound when I was a boy. She must have had some rat in her, now that I think of it. Brown hair, beady little eyes, liked cheese. Might be she had a tail too, I never looked to see.\u201d\nAll of Castle Black was connected underground by a maze of tunnels that the brothers called the wormways. It was dark and gloomy underneath the earth, so the wormways were little used in summer, but when the winter winds began to blow and the snows began to fall, the tunnels became the quickest way to move about the castle. The stewards were making use of them already. Jon saw candles burning in several wall niches as they made their way along the tunnel, their footsteps echoing ahead of them.\nBowen Marsh was waiting at a junction where four wormways met. With him he had Wick Whittlestick, tall and skinny as a spear. \u201cThese are the counts from three turns ago,\u201d Marsh told Jon, offering him a thick sheaf of papers, \u201cfor comparison with our present stores. Shall we start with the granaries?\u201d\nThey moved through the grey gloom beneath the earth. Each storeroom had a solid oaken door closed with an iron padlock as big as a supper plate. \u201cIs pilferage a problem?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cNot as yet,\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cOnce winter comes, though, your lordship might be wise to post guards down here.\u201d\nWick Whittlestick wore the keys on a ring about his neck. They all looked alike to Jon, yet somehow Wick found the right one for every door. Once inside, he would take a fist-sized chunk of chalk from his pouch and mark each cask and sack and barrel as he counted them while Marsh compared the new count to the old.\nIn the granaries were oats and wheat and barley, and barrels of coarse ground flour. In the root cellars strings of onions and garlic dangled from the rafters, and bags of carrots, parsnips, radishes, and white and yellow turnips filled the shelves. One storeroom held wheels of cheese so large it took two men to move them. In the next, casks of salt beef, salt pork, salt mutton, and salt cod were stacked ten feet high. Three hundred hams and three thousand long black sausages hung from ceiling beams below the smokehouse. In the spice locker they found peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon, mustard seeds, coriander, sage and clary sage and parsley, blocks of salt. Elsewhere were casks of apples and pears, dried peas, dried figs, bags of walnuts, bags of chestnuts, bags of almonds, planks of dry smoked salmon, clay jars packed with olives in oil and sealed with wax. One storeroom offered potted hare, haunch of deer in honey, pickled cabbage, pickled beets, pickled onions, pickled eggs, and pickled herring.\nAs they moved from one vault to another, the wormways seemed to grow colder. Before long Jon could see their breath frosting in the lantern light. \u201cWe\u2019re beneath the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cAnd soon inside it,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cThe meat won\u2019t spoil in the cold. For long storage, it\u2019s better than salting.\u201d\nThe next door was made of rusty iron. Behind it was a flight of wooden steps. Dolorous Edd led the way with his lantern. Up top they found a tunnel as long as Winterfell\u2019s great hall though no wider than the wormways. The walls were ice, bristling with iron hooks. From each hook hung a carcass: skinned deer and elk, sides of beef, huge sows swinging from the ceiling, headless sheep and goats, even horse and bear. Hoarfrost covered everything.\nAs they did their count, Jon peeled the glove off his left hand and touched the nearest haunch of venison. He could feel his fingers sticking, and when he pulled them back he lost a bit of skin. His fingertips were numb. What did you expect? There\u2019s a mountain of ice above your head, more tons than even Bowen Marsh could count. Even so, the room felt colder than it should.\n\u201cIt is worse than I feared, my lord,\u201d Marsh announced when he was done. He sounded gloomier than Dolorous Edd.\nJon had just been thinking that all the meat in the world surrounded them. You know nothing, Jon Snow. \u201cHow so? This seems a deal of food to me.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a long summer. The harvests were bountiful, the lords generous. We had enough laid by to see us through three years of winter. Four, with a bit of scrimping. Now, though, if we must go on feeding all these king\u2019s men and queen\u2019s men and wildlings\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Mole\u2019s Town alone has a thousand useless mouths, and still they come. Three more turned up yesterday at the gates, a dozen the day before. It cannot go on. Settling them on the Gift, that\u2019s well and good, but it is too late to plant crops. We\u2019ll be down to turnips and pease porridge before the year is out. After that we\u2019ll be drinking the blood of our own horses.\u201d\n\u201cYum,\u201d declared Dolorous Edd. \u201cNothing beats a hot cup of horse blood on a cold night. I like mine with a pinch of cinnamon sprinkled on top.\u201d\nThe Lord Steward paid him no mind. \u201cThere will be sickness too,\u201d he went on, \u201cbleeding gums and loose teeth. Maester Aemon used to say that lime juice and fresh meat would remedy that, but our limes were gone a year ago and we do not have enough fodder to keep herds afoot for fresh meat. We should butcher all but a few breeding pairs. It\u2019s past time. In winters past, food could be brought up the kingsroad from the south, but with the war\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it is still autumn, I know, but I would advise we go on winter rations nonetheless, if it please my lord.\u201d\nThe men will love that. \u201cIf we must. We\u2019ll cut each man\u2019s portion by a quarter.\u201d If my brothers are complaining of me now, what will they say when they\u2019re eating snow and acorn paste?\n\u201cThat will help, my lord.\u201d The Lord Steward\u2019s tone made it plain that he did not think that it would help enough.\nDolorous Edd said, \u201cNow I understand why King Stannis let the wildlings through the Wall. He means for us to eat them.\u201d\nJon had to smile. \u201cIt will not come to that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Edd. \u201cThey look a stringy lot, and my teeth are not as sharp as when I was younger.\u201d\n\u201cIf we had sufficient coin, we could buy food from the south and bring it in by ship,\u201d the Lord Steward said.\nWe could, thought Jon, if we had the gold, and someone willing to sell us food. Both of those were lacking. Our best hope may be the Eyrie. The Vale of Arryn was famously fertile and had gone untouched during the fighting. Jon wondered how Lady Catelyn\u2019s sister would feel about feeding Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. As a boy, he often felt as if the lady grudged him every bite.\n\u201cWe can always hunt if need be,\u201d Wick Whittlestick put in. \u201cThere\u2019s still game in the woods.\u201d\n\u201cAnd wildlings, and darker things,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cI would not send out hunters, my lord. I would not.\u201d\nNo. You would close our gates forever and seal them up with stone and ice. Half of Castle Black agreed with the Lord Steward\u2019s views, he knew. The other half heaped scorn on them. \u201cSeal our gates and plant your fat black arses on the Wall, aye, and the free folk\u2019ll come swarming o\u2019er the Bridge o\u2019 Skulls or through some gate you thought you\u2019d sealed five hundred years ago,\u201d the old forester Dywen had declared loudly over supper, two nights past. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the men to watch a hundred leagues o\u2019 Wall. Tormund Giantsbutt and the bloody Weeper knows it too. Ever see a duck frozen in a pond, with his feet in the ice? It works the same for crows.\u201d Most rangers echoed Dywen, whilst the stewards and builders inclined toward Bowen Marsh.\nBut that was a quandary for another day. Here and now, the problem was food. \u201cWe cannot leave King Stannis and his men to starve, even if we wished to,\u201d Jon said. \u201cIf need be, he could simply take all this at swordpoint. We do not have the men to stop them. The wildlings must be fed as well.\u201d\n\u201cHow, my lord?\u201d asked Bowen Marsh.\nWould that I knew. \u201cWe will find a way.\u201d\nBy the time they returned to the surface, the shadows of the afternoon were growing long. Clouds streaked the sky like tattered banners, grey and white and torn. The yard outside the armory was empty, but inside Jon found the king\u2019s squire awaiting him. Devan was a skinny lad of some twelve years, brown of hair and eye. They found him frozen by the forge, hardly daring to move as Ghost sniffed him up and down. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Jon said, but the boy flinched at the sound of his voice, and that sudden motion made the direwolf bare his teeth. \u201cNo!\u201d Jon said. \u201cGhost, leave him be. Away.\u201d The wolf slunk back to his ox bone, silence on four feet.\nDevan looked as pale as Ghost, his face damp with perspiration. \u201cM-my lord. His Grace c-commands your presence.\u201d The boy was clad in Baratheon gold and black, with the flaming heart of a queen\u2019s man sewn above his own.\n\u201cYou mean requests,\u201d said Dolorous Edd. \u201cHis Grace requests the presence of the lord commander. That\u2019s how I\u2019d say it.\u201d\n\u201cLeave it be, Edd.\u201d Jon was in no mood for such squabbles.\n\u201cSir Richard and Ser Justin have returned,\u201d said Devan. \u201cWill you come, my lord?\u201d\nThe wrong-way rangers. Massey and Horpe had ridden south, not north. Whatever they had learned did not concern the Night\u2019s Watch, but Jon was curious all the same. \u201cIf it would please His Grace.\u201d He followed the young squire back across the yard. Ghost padded after them until Jon said, \u201cNo. Stay!\u201d Instead the direwolf ran off.\nIn the King\u2019s Tower, Jon was stripped of his weapons and admitted to the royal presence. The solar was hot and crowded. Stannis and his captains were gathered over the map of the north. The wrong-way rangers were amongst them. Sigorn was there as well, the young Magnar of Thenn, clad in a leather hauberk sewn with bronze scales. Rattleshirt sat scratching at the manacle on his wrist with a cracked yellow fingernail. Brown stubble covered his sunken cheeks and receding chin, and strands of dirty hair hung across his eyes. \u201cHere he comes,\u201d he said when he saw Jon, \u201cthe brave boy who slew Mance Rayder when he was caged and bound.\u201d The big square-cut gem that adorned his iron cuff glimmered redly. \u201cDo you like my ruby, Snow? A token o\u2019 love from Lady Red.\u201d\nJon ignored him and took a knee. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d announced the squire Devan, \u201cI\u2019ve brought Lord Snow.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that. Lord Commander. You know my knights and captains, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cI have that honor.\u201d He had made it a point to learn all he could of the men around the king. Queen\u2019s men, all. It struck Jon as odd that there were no king\u2019s men about the king, but that seemed to be the way of it. The king\u2019s men had incurred Stannis\u2019s ire on Dragonstone if the talk Jon heard was true.\n\u201cThere is wine. Or water boiled with lemons.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, but no.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish. I have a gift for you, Lord Snow.\u201d The king waved a hand at Rattleshirt. \u201cHim.\u201d\nLady Melisandre smiled. \u201cYou did say you wanted men, Lord Snow. I believe our Lord of Bones still qualifies.\u201d\nJon was aghast. \u201cYour Grace, this man cannot be trusted. If I keep him here, someone will slit his throat for him. If I send him ranging, he\u2019ll just go back over to the wildlings.\u201d\n\u201cNot me. I\u2019m done with those bloody fools.\u201d Rattleshirt tapped the ruby on his wrist. \u201cAsk your red witch, bastard.\u201d\nMelisandre spoke softly in a strange tongue. The ruby at her throat throbbed slowly, and Jon saw that the smaller stone on Rattleshirt\u2019s wrist was brightening and darkening as well. \u201cSo long as he wears the gem he is bound to me, blood and soul,\u201d the red priestess said. \u201cThis man will serve you faithfully. The flames do not lie, Lord Snow.\u201d\nPerhaps not, Jon thought, but you do.\n\u201cI\u2019ll range for you, bastard,\u201d Rattleshirt declared. \u201cI\u2019ll give you sage counsel or sing you pretty songs, as you prefer. I\u2019ll even fight for you. Just don\u2019t ask me to wear your cloak.\u201d\nYou are not worthy of one, Jon thought, but he held his tongue. No good would come of squabbling before the king.\nKing Stannis said, \u201cLord Snow, tell me of Mors Umber.\u201d\nThe Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, Jon thought, but another voice within him said, Words are not swords. \u201cThe elder of the Greatjon\u2019s uncles. Crowfood, they call him. A crow once took him for dead and pecked out his eye. He caught the bird in his fist and bit its head off. When Mors was young he was a fearsome fighter. His sons died on the Trident, his wife in childbed. His only daughter was carried off by wildlings thirty years ago.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he wants the head,\u201d said Harwood Fell.\n\u201cCan this man Mors be trusted?\u201d asked Stannis.\nHas Mors Umber bent the knee? \u201cYour Grace should have him swear an oath before his heart tree.\u201d\nGodry the Giantslayer guffawed. \u201cI had forgotten that you northmen worship trees.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of god lets himself be pissed upon by dogs?\u201d asked Farring\u2019s crony Clayton Suggs.\nJon chose to ignore them. \u201cYour Grace, might I know if the Umbers have declared for you?\u201d\n\u201cHalf of them, and only if I meet this Crowfood\u2019s price,\u201d said Stannis, in an irritated tone. \u201cHe wants Mance Rayder\u2019s skull for a drinking cup, and he wants a pardon for his brother, who has ridden south to join Bolton. Whoresbane, he\u2019s called.\u201d\nSer Godry was amused by that as well. \u201cWhat names these northmen have! Did this one bite the head off some whore?\u201d\nJon regarded him coolly. \u201cYou might say so. A whore who tried to rob him, fifty years ago in Oldtown.\u201d Odd as it might seem, old Hoarfrost Umber had once believed his youngest son had the makings of a maester. Mors loved to boast about the crow who took his eye, but Hother\u2019s tale was only told in whispers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0most like because the whore he\u2019d disemboweled had been a man. \u201cHave other lords declared for Bolton too?\u201d\nThe red priestess slid closer to the king. \u201cI saw a town with wooden walls and wooden streets, filled with men. Banners flew above its walls: a moose, a battle-axe, three pine trees, longaxes crossed beneath a crown, a horse\u2019s head with fiery eyes.\u201d\n\u201cHornwood, Cerwyn, Tallhart, Ryswell, and Dustin,\u201d supplied Ser Clayton Suggs. \u201cTraitors, all. Lapdogs of the Lannisters.\u201d\n\u201cThe Ryswells and Dustins are tied to House Bolton by marriage,\u201d Jon informed him. \u201cThese others have lost their lords in the fighting. I do not know who leads them now. Crowfood is no lapdog, though. Your Grace would do well to accept his terms.\u201d\nStannis ground his teeth. \u201cHe informs me that Umber will not fight Umber, for any cause.\u201d\nJon was not surprised. \u201cIf it comes to swords, see where Hother\u2019s banner flies and put Mors on the other end of the line.\u201d\nThe Giantslayer disagreed. \u201cYou would make His Grace look weak. I say, show our strength. Burn Last Hearth to the ground and ride to war with Crowfood\u2019s head mounted on a spear, as a lesson to the next lord who presumes to offer half his homage.\u201d\n\u201cA fine plan if what you want is every hand in the north raised against you. Half is more than none. The Umbers have no love for the Boltons. If Whoresbane has joined the Bastard, it can only be because the Lannisters hold the Greatjon captive.\u201d\n\u201cThat is his pretext, not his reason,\u201d declared Ser Godry. \u201cIf the nephew dies in chains, these uncles can claim his lands and lordship for themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThe Greatjon has sons and daughters both. In the north the children of a man\u2019s body still come before his uncles, ser.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they die. Dead children come last everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cSuggest that in the hearing of Mors Umber, Ser Godry, and you will learn more of death than you might wish.\u201d\n\u201cI have slain a giant, boy. Why should I fear some flea-ridden northman who paints one on his shield?\u201d\n\u201cThe giant was running away. Mors won\u2019t be.\u201d\nThe big knight flushed. \u201cYou have a bold tongue in the king\u2019s solar, boy. In the yard you sang a different song.\u201d\n\u201cOh, leave off, Godry,\u201d said Ser Justin Massey, a loose-limbed, fleshy knight with a ready smile and a mop of flaxen hair. Massey had been one of the wrong-way rangers. \u201cWe all know what a big giant sword you have, I\u2019m sure. No need for you to wave it in our faces yet again.\u201d\n\u201cThe only thing waving here is your tongue, Massey.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Stannis snapped. \u201cLord Snow, attend me. I have lingered here in the hopes that the wildlings would be fool enough to mount another attack upon the Wall. As they will not oblige me, it is time I dealt with my other foes.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Jon\u2019s tone was wary. What does he want of me? \u201cI have no love for Lord Bolton or his son, but the Night\u2019s Watch cannot take up arms against them. Our vows prohibit\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know all about your vows. Spare me your rectitude, Lord Snow, I have strength enough without you. I have a mind to march against the Dreadfort.\u201d When he saw the shock on Jon\u2019s face, he smiled. \u201cDoes that surprise you? Good. What surprises one Snow may yet surprise another. The Bastard of Bolton has gone south, taking Hother Umber with him. On that Mors Umber and Arnolf Karstark are agreed. That can only mean a strike at Moat Cailin, to open the way for his lord father to return to the north. The bastard must think I am too busy with the wildlings to trouble him. Well and good. The boy has shown me his throat. I mean to rip it out. Roose Bolton may regain the north, but when he does he will find that his castle, herds, and harvest all belong to me. If I take the Dreadfort unawares\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Jon blurted.\nIt was as if he whacked a wasps\u2019 nest with a stick. One of the queen\u2019s men laughed, one spat, one muttered a curse, and the rest all tried to talk at once. \u201cThe boy has milkwater in his veins,\u201d said Ser Godry the Giantslayer. And Lord Sweet huffed, \u201cThe craven sees an outlaw behind every blade of grass.\u201d\nStannis raised a hand for silence. \u201cExplain your meaning.\u201d\nWhere to begin? Jon moved to the map. Candles had been placed at its corners to keep the hide from rolling up. A finger of warm wax was puddling out across the Bay of Seals, slow as a glacier. \u201cTo reach the Dreadfort, Your Grace must travel down the kingsroad past the Last River, turn south by east and cross the Lonely Hills.\u201d He pointed. \u201cThose are Umber lands, where they know every tree and every rock. The kingsroad runs along their western marches for a hundred leagues. Mors will cut your host to pieces unless you meet his terms and win him to your cause.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Let us say I do that.\u201d\n\u201cThat will bring you to the Dreadfort,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut unless your host can outmarch a raven or a line of beacon fires, the castle will know of your approach. It will be an easy thing for Ramsay Bolton to cut off your retreat and leave you far from the Wall, without food or refuge, surrounded by your foes.\u201d\n\u201cOnly if he abandons his siege of Moat Cailin.\u201d\n\u201cMoat Cailin will fall before you ever reach the Dreadfort. Once Lord Roose has joined his strength to Ramsay\u2019s, they will have you outnumbered five to one.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother won battles at worse odds.\u201d\n\u201cYou assume Moat Cailin will fall quickly, Snow,\u201d objected Justin Massey, \u201cbut the ironmen are doughty fighters, and I\u2019ve heard it said that the Moat has never been taken.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the south. A small garrison in Moat Cailin can play havoc with any army coming up the causeway, but the ruins are vulnerable from the north and east.\u201d Jon turned back to Stannis. \u201cSire, this is a bold stroke, but the risk\u2014\u201d The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part. Baratheon or Bolton should be the same to me. \u201cIf Roose Bolton should catch you beneath his walls with his main strength, it will be the end for all of you.\u201d\n\u201cRisk is part of war,\u201d declared Ser Richard Horpe, a lean knight with a ravaged face whose quilted doublet showed three death\u2019s-head moths on a field of ash and bone. \u201cEvery battle is a gamble, Snow. The man who does nothing also takes a risk.\u201d\n\u201cThere are risks and risks, Ser Richard. This one\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it is too much, too soon, too far away. I know the Dreadfort. It is a strong castle, all of stone, with thick walls and massive towers. With winter coming you will find it well provisioned. Centuries ago, House Bolton rose up against the King in the North, and Harlon Stark laid siege to the Dreadfort. It took him two years to starve them out. To have any hope of taking the castle, Your Grace would need siege engines, towers, battering rams\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSiege towers can be raised if need be,\u201d Stannis said. \u201cTrees can be felled for rams if rams are required. Arnolf Karstark writes that fewer than fifty men remain at the Dreadfort, half of them servants. A strong castle weakly held is weak.\u201d\n\u201cFifty men inside a castle are worth five hundred outside.\u201d\n\u201cThat depends upon the men,\u201d said Richard Horpe. \u201cThese will be greybeards and green boys, the men this bastard did not deem fit for battle. Our own men were blooded and tested on the Blackwater, and they are led by knights.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw how we went through the wildlings.\u201d Ser Justin pushed back a lock of flaxen hair. \u201cThe Karstarks have sworn to join us at the Dreadfort, and we will have our wildlings as well. Three hundred men of fighting age. Lord Harwood made a count as they were passing through the gate. Their women fight as well.\u201d\nStannis gave him a sour look. \u201cNot for me, ser. I want no widows wailing in my wake. The women will remain here, with the old, the wounded, and the children. They will serve as hostages for the loyalty of their husbands and fathers. The wildling men will form my van. The Magnar will command them, with their own chiefs as serjeants. First, though, we must needs arm them.\u201d\nHe means to plunder our armory, Jon realized. Food and clothing, land and castles, now weapons. He draws me in deeper every day. Words might not be swords, but swords were swords. \u201cI could find three hundred spears,\u201d he said, reluctantly. \u201cHelms as well, if you\u2019ll take them old and dinted and red with rust.\u201d\n\u201cArmor?\u201d asked the Magnar. \u201cPlate? Mail?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Donal Noye died we lost our armorer.\u201d The rest Jon left unspoken. Give the wildlings mail and they\u2019ll be twice as great a danger to the realm.\n\u201cBoiled leather will suffice,\u201d said Ser Godry. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve tasted battle, the survivors can loot the dead.\u201d\nThe few who live that long. If Stannis placed the free folk in the van, most would perish quickly. \u201cDrinking from Mance Rayder\u2019s skull may give Mors Umber pleasure, but seeing wildlings cross his lands will not. The free folk have been raiding the Umbers since the Dawn of Days, crossing the Bay of Seals for gold and sheep and women. One of those carried off was Crowfood\u2019s daughter. Your Grace, leave the wildlings here. Taking them will only serve to turn my lord father\u2019s bannermen against you.\u201d\n\u201cYour father\u2019s bannermen seem to have no liking for my cause in any case. I must assume they see me as\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what was it that you called me, Lord Snow? Another doomed pretender?\u201d Stannis stared at the map. For a long moment the only sound was the king grinding his teeth. \u201cLeave me. All of you. Lord Snow, remain.\u201d\nThe brusque dismissal did not sit well with Justin Massey, but he had no choice but to smile and withdraw. Horpe followed him out, after giving Jon a measured look. Clayton Suggs drained his cup dry and muttered something to Harwood Fell that made the younger man laugh. Boy was part of it. Suggs was an upjumped hedge knight, as crude as he was strong. The last man to take his leave was Rattleshirt. At the door, he gave Jon a mocking bow, grinning through a mouthful of brown and broken teeth.\nAll of you did not seem to include Lady Melisandre. The king\u2019s red shadow. Stannis called to Devan for more lemon water. When his cup was filled the king drank, and said, \u201cHorpe and Massey aspire to your father\u2019s seat. Massey wants the wildling princess too. He once served my brother Robert as squire and acquired his appetite for female flesh. Horpe will take Val to wife if I command it, but it is battle he lusts for. As a squire he dreamed of a white cloak, but Cersei Lannister spoke against him and Robert passed him over. Perhaps rightly. Ser Richard is too fond of killing. Which would you have as Lord of Winterfell, Snow? The smiler or the slayer?\u201d\nJon said, \u201cWinterfell belongs to my sister Sansa.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard all I need to hear of Lady Lannister and her claim.\u201d The king set the cup aside. \u201cYou could bring the north to me. Your father\u2019s bannermen would rally to the son of Eddard Stark. Even Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse. White Harbor would give me a ready source of supply and a secure base to which I could retreat at need. It is not too late to amend your folly, Snow. Take a knee and swear that bastard sword to me, and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\u201d\nHow many times will he make me say it? \u201cMy sword is sworn to the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\nStannis looked disgusted. \u201cYour father was a stubborn man as well. Honor, he called it. Well, honor has its costs, as Lord Eddard learned to his sorrow. If it gives you any solace, Horpe and Massey are doomed to disappointment. I am more inclined to bestow Winterfell upon Arnolf Karstark. A good northman.\u201d\n\u201cA northman.\u201d Better a Karstark than a Bolton or a Greyjoy, Jon told himself, but the thought gave him little solace. \u201cThe Karstarks abandoned my brother amongst his enemies.\u201d\n\u201cAfter your brother took off Lord Rickard\u2019s head. Arnolf was a thousand leagues away. He has Stark blood in him. The blood of Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than half the other Houses of the north.\u201d\n\u201cThose other Houses have not declared for me.\u201d\n\u201cArnolf Karstark is an old man with a crooked back, and even in his youth he was never the fighter Lord Rickard was. The rigors of the campaign may well kill him.\u201d\n\u201cHe has heirs,\u201d Stannis snapped. \u201cTwo sons, six grandsons, some daughters. If Robert had fathered trueborn sons, many who are dead might still be living.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace would do better with Mors Crowfood.\u201d\n\u201cThe Dreadfort will be the proof of that.\u201d\n\u201cThen you mean to go ahead with this attack?\u201d\n\u201cDespite the counsel of the great Lord Snow? Aye. Horpe and Massey may be ambitious, but they are not wrong. I dare not sit idle whilst Roose Bolton\u2019s star waxes and mine wanes. I must strike and show the north that I am still a man to fear.\u201d\n\u201cThe merman of Manderly was not amongst those banners Lady Melisandre saw in her fires,\u201d Jon said. \u201cIf you had White Harbor and Lord Wyman\u2019s knights\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf is a word for fools. We have had no word from Davos. It may be he never reached White Harbor. Arnolf Karstark writes that the storms have been fierce upon the narrow sea. Be that as it may. I have no time to grieve, nor wait upon the whims of Lord Too-Fat. I must consider White Harbor lost to me. Without a son of Winterfell to stand beside me, I can only hope to win the north by battle. That requires stealing a leaf from my brother\u2019s book. Not that Robert ever read one. I must deal my foes a mortal blow before they know that I am on them.\u201d\nJon realized that his words were wasted. Stannis would take the Dreadfort or die in the attempt. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, a voice said, but another replied, Stannis fights for the realm, the ironmen for thralls and plunder. \u201cYour Grace, I know where you might find more men. Give me the wildlings, and I will gladly tell you where and how.\u201d\n\u201cI gave you Rattleshirt. Be content with him.\u201d\n\u201cI want them all.\u201d\n\u201cSome of your own Sworn Brothers would have me believe that you are half a wildling yourself. Is it true?\u201d\n\u201cTo you they are only arrow fodder. I can make better use of them upon the Wall. Give them to me to do with as I will, and I\u2019ll show you where to find your victory\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and men as well.\u201d\nStannis rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cYou haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Ned Stark father you on some fishwife? How many men?\u201d\n\u201cTwo thousand. Perhaps three.\u201d\n\u201cThree thousand? What manner of men are these?\u201d\n\u201cProud. Poor. Prickly where their honor is concerned but fierce fighters.\u201d\n\u201cThis had best not be some bastard\u2019s trick. Will I trade three hundred fighters for three thousand? Aye, I will. I am not an utter fool. If I leave the girl with you as well, do I have your word that you will keep our princess closely?\u201d\nShe is not a princess. \u201cAs you wish, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cDo I need to make you swear an oath before a tree?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Was that a jape? With Stannis, it was hard to tell.\n\u201cDone, then. Now, where are these men?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find them here.\u201d Jon spread his burned hand across the map, west of the kingsroad and south of the Gift.\n\u201cThose mountains?\u201d Stannis grew suspicious. \u201cI see no castles marked there. No roads, no towns, no villages.\u201d\n\u201cThe map is not the land, my father often said. Men have lived in the high valleys and mountain meadows for thousands of years, ruled by their clan chiefs. Petty lords, you would call them, though they do not use such titles amongst themselves. Clan champions fight with huge two-handed greatswords, while the common men sling stones and batter one another with staffs of mountain ash. A quarrelsome folk, it must be said. When they are not fighting one another, they tend their herds, fish the Bay of Ice, and breed the hardiest mounts you\u2019ll ever ride.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they will fight for me, you believe?\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I beg for what is owed me?\u201d\n\u201cAsk, I said, not beg.\u201d Jon pulled back his hand. \u201cIt is no good sending messages. Your Grace will need to go to them yourself. Eat their bread and salt, drink their ale, listen to their pipers, praise the beauty of their daughters and the courage of their sons, and you\u2019ll have their swords. The clans have not seen a king since Torrhen Stark bent his knee. Your coming does them honor. Command them to fight for you, and they will look at one another and say, \u2018Who is this man? He is no king of mine.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cHow many clans are you speaking of?\u201d\n\u201cTwo score, small and large. Flint, Wull, Norrey, Liddle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0win Old Flint and Big Bucket, the rest will follow.\u201d\n\u201cBig Bucket?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wull. He has the biggest belly in the mountains, and the most men. The Wulls fish the Bay of Ice and warn their little ones that ironmen will carry them off if they don\u2019t behave. To reach them Your Grace must pass through the Norrey\u2019s lands, however. They live the nearest to the Gift and have always been good friends to the Watch. I could give you guides.\u201d\n\u201cCould?\u201d Stannis missed little. \u201cOr will?\u201d\n\u201cWill. You\u2019ll need them. And some sure-footed garrons too. The paths up there are little more than goat tracks.\u201d\n\u201cGoat tracks?\u201d The king\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI speak of moving swiftly, and you waste my time with goat tracks?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the Young Dragon conquered Dorne, he used a goat track to bypass the Dornish watchtowers on the Boneway.\u201d\n\u201cI know that tale as well, but Daeron made too much of it in that vainglorious book of his. Ships won that war, not goat tracks. Oakenfist broke the Planky Town and swept halfway up the Greenblood whilst the main Dornish strength was engaged in the Prince\u2019s Pass.\u201d Stannis drummed his fingers on the map. \u201cThese mountain lords will not hinder my passage?\u201d\n\u201cOnly with feasts. Each will try to outdo the others with his hospitality. My lord father said he never ate half so well as when visiting the clans.\u201d\n\u201cFor three thousand men, I suppose I can endure some pipes and porridge,\u201d the king said, though his tone begrudged even that.\nJon turned to Melisandre. \u201cMy lady, fair warning. The old gods are strong in those mountains. The clansmen will not suffer insults to their heart trees.\u201d\nThat seemed to amuse her. \u201cHave no fear, Jon Snow, I will not trouble your mountain savages and their dark gods. My place is here with you and your brave brothers.\u201d\nThat was the last thing Jon Snow would have wanted, but before he could object, the king said, \u201cWhere would you have me lead these stalwarts if not against the Dreadfort?\u201d\nJon glanced down at the map. \u201cDeepwood Motte.\u201d He tapped it with a finger. \u201cIf Bolton means to fight the ironmen, so must you. Deepwood is a motte-and-bailey castle in the midst of thick forest, easy to creep up on unawares. A wooden castle, defended by an earthen dike and a palisade of logs. The going will be slower through the mountains, admittedly, but up there your host can move unseen, to emerge almost at the gates of Deepwood.\u201d\nStannis rubbed his jaw. \u201cWhen Balon Greyjoy rose the first time, I beat the ironmen at sea, where they are fiercest. On land, taken unawares\u00a0\u2026\u00a0aye. I have won a victory over the wildlings and their King-Beyond-the-Wall. If I can smash the ironmen as well, the north will know it has a king again.\u201d\nAnd I will have a thousand wildlings, thought Jon, and no way to feed even half that number.",

      "content": "TYRION\nThe Shy Maid moved through the fog like a blind man groping his way down an unfamiliar hall.\nSepta Lemore was praying. The mists muffled the sound of her voice, making it seem small and hushed. Griff paced the deck, mail clinking softly beneath his wolfskin cloak. From time to time he touched his sword, as if to make certain that it still hung at his side. Rolly Duckfield was pushing at the starboard pole, Yandry at the larboard. Ysilla had the tiller.\n\u201cI do not like this place,\u201d Haldon Halfmaester muttered.\n\u201cFrightened of a little fog?\u201d mocked Tyrion, though in truth there was quite a lot of fog. At the prow of the Shy Maid, Young Griff stood with the third pole, to push them away from hazards as they loomed up through the mists. The lanterns had been lit fore and aft, but the fog was so thick that all the dwarf could see from amidships was a light floating out ahead of him and another following behind. His own task was to tend the brazier and make certain that the fire did not go out.\n\u201cThis is no common fog, Hugor Hill,\u201d Ysilla insisted. \u201cIt stinks of sorcery, as you would know if you had a nose to smell it. Many a voyager has been lost here, poleboats and pirates and great river galleys too. They wander forlorn through the mists, searching for a sun they cannot find until madness or hunger claim their lives. There are restless spirits in the air here and tormented souls below the water.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s one now,\u201d said Tyrion. Off to starboard a hand large enough to crush the boat was reaching up from the murky depths. Only the tops of two fingers broke the river\u2019s surface, but as the Shy Maid eased on past he could see the rest of the hand rippling below the water and a pale face looking up. Though his tone was light, he was uneasy. This was a bad place, rank with despair and death. Ysilla is not wrong. This fog is not natural. Something foul grew in the waters here, and festered in the air. Small wonder the stone men go mad.\n\u201cYou should not make mock,\u201d warned Ysilla. \u201cThe whispering dead hate the warm and quick and ever seek for more damned souls to join them.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt they have a shroud my size.\u201d The dwarf stirred the coals with a poker.\n\u201cHatred does not stir the stone men half so much as hunger.\u201d Haldon Halfmaester had wrapped a yellow scarf around his mouth and nose, muffling his voice. \u201cNothing any sane man would want to eat grows in these fogs. Thrice each year the triarchs of Volantis send a galley upriver with provisions, but the mercy ships are oft late and sometimes bring more mouths than food.\u201d\nYoung Griff said, \u201cThere must be fish in the river.\u201d\n\u201cI would not eat any fish taken from these waters,\u201d said Ysilla. \u201cI would not.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d do well not to breathe the fog either,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cGarin\u2019s Curse is all about us.\u201d\nThe only way not to breathe the fog is not to breathe. \u201cGarin\u2019s Curse is only greyscale,\u201d said Tyrion. The curse was oft seen in children, especially in damp, cold climes. The afflicted flesh stiffened, calcified, and cracked, though the dwarf had read that greyscale\u2019s progress could be stayed by limes, mustard poultices, and scalding-hot baths (the maesters said) or by prayer, sacrifice, and fasting (the septons insisted). Then the disease passed, leaving its young victims disfigured but alive. Maesters and septons alike agreed that children marked by greyscale could never be touched by the rarer mortal form of the affliction, nor by its terrible swift cousin, the grey plague. \u201cDamp is said to be the culprit,\u201d he said. \u201cFoul humors in the air. Not curses.\u201d\n\u201cThe conquerors did not believe either, Hugor Hill,\u201d said Ysilla. \u201cThe men of Volantis and Valyria hung Garin in a golden cage and made mock as he called upon his Mother to destroy them. But in the night the waters rose and drowned them, and from that day to this they have not rested. They are down there still beneath the water, they who were once the lords of fire. Their cold breath rises from the murk to make these fogs, and their flesh has turned as stony as their hearts.\u201d\nThe stump of Tyrion\u2019s nose was itching fiercely. He gave it a scratch. The old woman may be right. This place is no good. I feel as if I am back in the privy again, watching my father die. He would go mad as well if he had to spend his days in this grey soup whilst his flesh and bones turned to stone.\nYoung Griff did not seem to share his misgivings. \u201cLet them try and trouble us, we\u2019ll show them what we\u2019re made of.\u201d\n\u201cWe are made of blood and bone, in the image of the Father and the Mother,\u201d said Septa Lemore. \u201cMake no vainglorious boasts, I beg you. Pride is a grievous sin. The stone men were proud as well, and the Shrouded Lord was proudest of them all.\u201d\nThe heat from the glowing coals brought a flush to Tyrion\u2019s face. \u201cIs there a Shrouded Lord? Or is he just some tale?\u201d\n\u201cThe Shrouded Lord has ruled these mists since Garin\u2019s day,\u201d said Yandry. \u201cSome say that he himself is Garin, risen from his watery grave.\u201d\n\u201cThe dead do not rise,\u201d insisted Haldon Halfmaester, \u201cand no man lives a thousand years. Yes, there is a Shrouded Lord. There have been a score of them. When one dies another takes his place. This one is a corsair from the Basilisk Islands who believed the Rhoyne would offer richer pickings than the Summer Sea.\u201d\n\u201cAye, I\u2019ve heard that too,\u201d said Duck, \u201cbut there\u2019s another tale I like better. The one that says he\u2019s not like t\u2019other stone men, that he started as a statue till a grey woman came out of the fog and kissed him with lips as cold as ice.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Griff. \u201cBe quiet, all of you.\u201d\nSepta Lemore sucked in her breath. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Tyrion saw nothing but the fog.\n\u201cSomething moved. I saw the water rippling.\u201d\n\u201cA turtle,\u201d the prince announced cheerfully. \u201cA big \u2019snapper, that\u2019s all it was.\u201d He thrust his pole out ahead of them and pushed them away from a towering green obelisk.\nThe fog clung to them, damp and chilly. A sunken temple loomed up out of the greyness as Yandry and Duck leaned upon their poles and paced slowly from prow to stern, pushing. They passed a marble stair that spiraled up from the mud and ended jaggedly in air. Beyond, half-seen, were other shapes: shattered spires, headless statues, trees with roots bigger than their boat.\n\u201cThis was the most beautiful city on the river, and the richest,\u201d said Yandry. \u201cChroyane, the festival city.\u201d\nToo rich, thought Tyrion, too beautiful. It is never wise to tempt the dragons. The drowned city was all around them. A half-seen shape flapped by overhead, pale leathery wings beating at the fog. The dwarf craned his head around to get a better look, but the thing was gone as suddenly as it had appeared.\nNot long after, another light floated into view. \u201cBoat,\u201d a voice called across the water, faintly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cShy Maid,\u201d Yandry shouted back.\n\u201cKingfisher. Up or down?\u201d\n\u201cDown. Hides and honey, ale and tallow.\u201d\n\u201cUp. Knives and needles, lace and linen, spice wine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat word from old Volantis?\u201d Yandry called.\n\u201cWar,\u201d the word came back.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Griff shouted. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the year turns,\u201d came the answer, \u201cNyessos and Malaquo go hand in hand, and the elephants show stripes.\u201d The voice faded as the other boat moved away from them. They watched its light dwindle and disappear.\n\u201cIs it wise to shout through the fog at boats we cannot see?\u201d asked Tyrion. \u201cWhat if they were pirates?\u201d They had been fortunate where the pirates were concerned, slipping down Dagger Lake by night, unseen and unmolested. Once Duck had caught a glimpse of a hull that he insisted belonged to Urho the Unwashed. The Shy Maid had been upwind, however, and Urho\u2014if Urho it had been\u2014had shown no interest in them.\n\u201cThe pirates will not sail into the Sorrows,\u201d said Yandry.\n\u201cElephants with stripes?\u201d Griff muttered. \u201cWhat is that about? Nyessos and Malaquo? Illyrio has paid Triarch Nyessos enough to own him eight times over.\u201d\n\u201cIn gold or cheese?\u201d quipped Tyrion.\nGriff rounded on him. \u201cUnless you can cut this fog with your next witticism, keep it to yourself.\u201d\nYes, Father, the dwarf almost said. I\u2019ll be quiet. Thank you. He did not know these Volantenes, yet it seemed to him that elephants and tigers might have good reason to make common cause when faced with dragons. Might be the cheesemonger has misjudged the situation. You can buy a man with gold, but only blood and steel will keep him true.\nThe little man stirred the coals again and blew on them to make them burn brighter. I hate this. I hate this fog, I hate this place, and I am less than fond of Griff. Tyrion still had the poison mushrooms he had plucked from the grounds of Illyrio\u2019s manse, and there were days when he was sore tempted to slip them into Griff\u2019s supper. The trouble was, Griff scarce seemed to eat.\nDuck and Yandry pushed against the poles. Ysilla turned the tiller. Young Griff pushed the Shy Maid away from a broken tower whose windows stared down like blind black eyes. Overhead her sail hung limp and heavy. The water deepened under her hull, until their poles could not touch bottom, but still the current pushed them downstream, until\u00a0\u2026\nAll Tyrion could see was something massive rising from the river, humped and ominous. He took it for a hill looming above a wooded island, or some colossal rock overgrown with moss and ferns and hidden by the fog. As the Shy Maid drew nearer, though, the shape of it came clearer. A wooden keep could be seen beside the water, rotted and overgrown. Slender spires took form above it, some of them snapped off like broken spears. Roofless towers appeared and disappeared, thrusting blindly upward. Halls and galleries drifted past: graceful buttresses, delicate arches, fluted columns, terraces and bowers.\nAll ruined, all desolate, all fallen.\nThe grey moss grew thickly here, covering the fallen stones in great mounds and bearding all the towers. Black vines crept in and out of windows, through doors and over archways, up the sides of high stone walls. The fog concealed three-quarters of the palace, but what they glimpsed was more than enough for Tyrion to know that this island fastness had been ten times the size of the Red Keep once and a hundred times more beautiful. He knew where he was. \u201cThe Palace of Love,\u201d he said softly.\n\u201cThat was the Rhoynar name,\u201d said Haldon Halfmaester, \u201cbut for a thousand years this has been the Palace of Sorrow.\u201d\nThe ruin was sad enough, but knowing what it had been made it even sadder. There was laughter here once, Tyrion thought. There were gardens bright with flowers and fountains sparkling golden in the sun. These steps once rang to the sound of lovers\u2019 footsteps, and beneath that broken dome marriages beyond count were sealed with a kiss. His thoughts turned to Tysha, who had so briefly been his lady wife. It was Jaime, he thought, despairing. He was my own blood, my big strong brother. When I was small he brought me toys, barrel hoops and blocks and a carved wooden lion. He gave me my first pony and taught me how to ride him. When he said that he had bought you for me, I never doubted him. Why would I? He was Jaime, and you were just some girl who\u2019d played a part. I had feared it from the start, from the moment you first smiled at me and let me touch your hand. My own father could not love me. Why would you if not for gold?\nThrough the long grey fingers of the fog, he heard again the deep shuddering thrum of a bowstring snapping taut, the grunt Lord Tywin made as the quarrel took him beneath the belly, the slap of cheeks on stone as he sat back down to die. \u201cWherever whores go,\u201d he said. And where is that? Tyrion wanted to ask him. Where did Tysha go, Father? \u201cHow much more of this fog must we endure?\u201d\n\u201cAnother hour should see us clear of the Sorrows,\u201d said Haldon Halfmaester. \u201cFrom there on, this should be a pleasure cruise. There\u2019s a village around every bend along the lower Rhoyne. Orchards and vineyards and fields of grain ripening in the sun, fisherfolk on the water, hot baths and sweet wines. Selhorys, Valysar, and Volon Therys are walled towns so large they would be cities in the Seven Kingdoms. I believe I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLight ahead,\u201d warned Young Griff.\nTyrion saw it too. Kingfisher, or another poleboat, he told himself, but somehow he knew that was not right. His nose itched. He scratched at it savagely. The light grew brighter as the Shy Maid approached it. A soft star in the distance, it glimmered faintly through the fog, beckoning them on. Shortly it became two lights, then three: a ragged row of beacons rising from the water.\n\u201cThe Bridge of Dream,\u201d Griff named it. \u201cThere will be stone men on the span. Some may start to wail at our approach, but they are not like to molest us. Most stone men are feeble creatures, clumsy, lumbering, witless. Near the end they all go mad, but that is when they are most dangerous. If need be, fend them off with the torches. On no account let them touch you.\u201d\n\u201cThey may not even see us,\u201d said Haldon Halfmaester. \u201cThe fog will hide us from them until we are almost at the bridge, and then we will be past before they know that we are here.\u201d\nStone eyes are blind eyes, thought Tyrion. The mortal form of greyscale began in the extremities, he knew: a tingling in a fingertip, a toenail turning black, a loss of feeling. As the numbness crept into the hand, or stole past the foot and up the leg, the flesh stiffened and grew cold and the victim\u2019s skin took on a greyish hue, resembling stone. He had heard it said that there were three good cures for greyscale: axe and sword and cleaver. Hacking off afflicted parts did sometimes stop the spread of the disease, Tyrion knew, but not always. Many a man had sacrificed one arm or foot, only to find the other going grey. Once that happened, hope was gone. Blindness was common when the stone reached the face. In the final stages the curse turned inward, to muscles, bones, and inner organs.\nAhead of them, the bridge grew larger. The Bridge of Dream, Griff called it, but this dream was smashed and broken. Pale stone arches marched off into the fog, reaching from the Palace of Sorrow to the river\u2019s western bank. Half of them had collapsed, pulled down by the weight of the grey moss that draped them and the thick black vines that snaked upward from the water. The broad wooden span of the bridge had rotted through, but some of the lamps that lined the way were still aglow. As the Shy Maid drew closer, Tyrion could see the shapes of stone men moving in the light, shuffling aimlessly around the lamps like slow grey moths. Some were naked, others clad in shrouds.\nGriff drew his longsword. \u201cYollo, light the torches. Lad, take Lemore back to her cabin and stay with her.\u201d\nYoung Griff gave his father a stubborn look. \u201cLemore knows where her cabin is. I want to stay.\u201d\n\u201cWe are sworn to protect you,\u201d Lemore said softly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be protected. I can use a sword as well as Duck. I\u2019m half a knight.\u201d\n\u201cAnd half a boy,\u201d said Griff. \u201cDo as you are told. Now.\u201d\nThe youth cursed under his breath and flung his pole down onto the deck. The sound echoed queerly in the fog, and for a moment it was as if poles were falling around them. \u201cWhy should I run and hide? Haldon is staying, and Ysilla. Even Hugor.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cbut I\u2019m small enough to hide behind a duck.\u201d He thrust half a dozen torches into the brazier\u2019s glowing coals and watched the oiled rags flare up. Don\u2019t stare at the fire, he told himself. The flames would leave him night blind.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dwarf,\u201d Young Griff said scornfully.\n\u201cMy secret is revealed,\u201d Tyrion agreed. \u201cAye, I\u2019m less than half of Haldon, and no one gives a mummer\u2019s fart whether I live or die.\u201d Least of all me. \u201cYou, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you are everything.\u201d\n\u201cDwarf,\u201d said Griff, \u201cI warned you\u2014\u201d\nA wail came shivering through the fog, faint and high.\nLemore whirled, trembling. \u201cSeven save us all.\u201d\nThe broken bridge was a bare five yards ahead. Around its piers, the water rippled white as the foam from a madman\u2019s mouth. Forty feet above, the stone men moaned and muttered beneath a flickering lamp. Most took no more notice of the Shy Maid than of a drifting log. Tyrion clutched his torch tighter and found that he was holding his breath. And then they were beneath the bridge, white walls heavy with curtains of grey fungus looming to either side, water foaming angrily around them. For a moment it looked as though they might crash into the right-hand pier, but Duck raised his pole and shoved off, back into the center of the channel, and a few heartbeats later they were clear.\nTyrion had no sooner exhaled than Young Griff grabbed hold of his arm. \u201cWhat do you mean? I am everything? What did you mean by that? Why am I everything?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cif the stone men had taken Yandry or Griff or our lovely Lemore, we would have grieved for them and gone on. Lose you, and this whole enterprise is undone, and all those years of feverish plotting by the cheesemonger and the eunuch will have been for naught\u00a0\u2026\u00a0isn\u2019t that so?\u201d\nThe boy looked to Griff. \u201cHe knows who I am.\u201d\nIf I did not know before, I would now. By then the Shy Maid was well downstream of the Bridge of Dream. All that remained was a dwindling light astern, and soon enough that would be gone as well. \u201cYou\u2019re Young Griff, son of Griff the sellsword,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cOr perhaps you are the Warrior in mortal guise. Let me take a closer look.\u201d He held up his torch, so that the light washed over Young Griff\u2019s face.\n\u201cLeave off,\u201d Griff commanded, \u201cor you will wish you had.\u201d\nThe dwarf ignored him. \u201cThe blue hair makes your eyes seem blue, that\u2019s good. And the tale of how you color it in honor of your dead Tyroshi mother was so touching it almost made me cry. Still, a curious man might wonder why some sellsword\u2019s whelp would need a soiled septa to instruct him in the Faith, or a chainless maester to tutor him in history and tongues. And a clever man might question why your father would engage a hedge knight to train you in arms instead of simply sending you off to apprentice with one of the free companies. It is almost as if someone wanted to keep you hidden whilst still preparing you for\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what? Now, there\u2019s a puzzlement, but I\u2019m sure that in time it will come to me. I must admit, you have noble features for a dead boy.\u201d\nThe boy flushed. \u201cI am not dead.\u201d\n\u201cHow not? My lord father wrapped your corpse in a crimson cloak and laid you down beside your sister at the foot of the Iron Throne, his gift to the new king. Those who had the stomach to lift the cloak said that half your head was gone.\u201d\nThe lad backed off a step, confused. \u201cYour\u2014?\u201d\n\u201c\u2014father, aye. Tywin of House Lannister. Perhaps you may have heard of him.\u201d\nYoung Griff hesitated. \u201cLannister? Your father\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is dead. At my hand. If it please Your Grace to call me Yollo or Hugor, so be it, but know that I was born Tyrion of House Lannister, trueborn son of Tywin and Joanna, both of whom I slew. Men will tell you that I am a kingslayer, a kinslayer, and a liar, and all of that is true\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but then, we are a company of liars, are we not? Take your feigned father. Griff, is it?\u201d The dwarf sniggered. \u201cYou should thank the gods that Varys the Spider is a part of this plot of yours. Griff would not have fooled the cockless wonder for an instant, no more than it did me. No lord, my lordship says, no knight. And I\u2019m no dwarf. Just saying a thing does not make it true. Who better to raise Prince Rhaegar\u2019s infant son than Prince Rhaegar\u2019s dear friend Jon Connington, once Lord of Griffin\u2019s Roost and Hand of the King?\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet.\u201d Griff\u2019s voice was uneasy.\nOn the larboard side of the boat, a huge stone hand was visible just below the water. Two fingers broke the surface. How many of those are there? Tyrion wondered. A trickle of moisture ran down his spine and made him shudder. The Sorrows drifted by them. Peering through the mists, he glimpsed a broken spire, a headless hero, an ancient tree torn from the ground and upended, its huge roots twisting through the roof and windows of a broken dome. Why does all of this seem so familiar?\nStraight on, a tilted stairway of pale marble rose up out of the dark water in a graceful spiral, ending abruptly ten feet above their heads. No, thought Tyrion, that is not possible.\n\u201cAhead.\u201d Lemore\u2019s voice was shivery. \u201cA light.\u201d\nAll of them looked. All of them saw it.\n\u201cKingfisher,\u201d said Griff. \u201cHer, or some other like her.\u201d But he drew his sword again.\nNo one said a word. The Shy Maid moved with the current. Her sail had not been raised since she first entered the Sorrows. She had no way to move but with the river. Duck stood squinting, clutching his pole with both hands. After a time even Yandry stopped pushing. Every eye was on the distant light. As they grew closer, it turned into two lights. Then three.\n\u201cThe Bridge of Dream,\u201d said Tyrion.\n\u201cInconceivable,\u201d said Haldon Halfmaester. \u201cWe\u2019ve left the bridge behind. Rivers only run one way.\u201d\n\u201cMother Rhoyne runs how she will,\u201d murmured Yandry.\n\u201cSeven save us,\u201d said Lemore.\nUp ahead, the stone men on the span began to wail. A few were pointing down at them. \u201cHaldon, get the prince below,\u201d commanded Griff.\nIt was too late. The current had them in its teeth. They drifted inexorably toward the bridge. Yandry stabbed out with his pole to keep them from smashing into a pier. The thrust shoved them sideways, through a curtain of pale grey moss. Tyrion felt tendrils brush against his face, soft as a whore\u2019s fingers. Then there was a crash behind him, and the deck tilted so suddenly that he almost lost his feet and went pitching over the side.\nA stone man crashed down into the boat.\nHe landed on the cabin roof, so heavily that the Shy Maid seemed to rock, and roared a word down at them in a tongue that Tyrion did not know. A second stone man followed, landing back beside the tiller. The weathered planks splintered beneath the impact, and Ysilla let out a shriek.\nDuck was closest to her. The big man did not waste time reaching for his sword. Instead he swung his pole, slamming it into the stone man\u2019s chest and knocking him off the boat into the river, where he sank at once without a sound.\nGriff was on the second man the instant he shambled down off the cabin roof. With a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left, he drove the creature backwards. As the current swept the Shy Maid beneath the bridge, their shifting shadows danced upon the mossy walls. When the stone man moved aft, Duck blocked his way, pole in hand. When he went forward, Haldon Halfmaester waved a second torch at him and drove him back. He had no choice but to come straight at Griff. The captain slid aside, his blade flashing. A spark flew where the steel bit into the stone man\u2019s calcified grey flesh, but his arm tumbled to the deck all the same. Griff kicked the limb aside. Yandry and Duck had come up with their poles. Together they forced the creature over the side and into the black waters of the Rhoyne.\nBy then the Shy Maid had drifted out from under the broken bridge. \u201cDid we get them all?\u201d asked Duck. \u201cHow many jumped?\u201d\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Tyrion, shivering.\n\u201cThree,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cBehind you.\u201d\nThe dwarf turned, and there he stood.\nThe leap had shattered one of his legs, and a jagged piece of pale bone jutted out through the rotted cloth of his breeches and the grey meat beneath. The broken bone was speckled with brown blood, but still he lurched forward, reaching for Young Griff. His hand was grey and stiff, but blood oozed between his knuckles as he tried to close his fingers to grasp. The boy stood staring, as still as if he too were made of stone. His hand was on his sword hilt, but he seemed to have forgotten why.\nTyrion kicked the lad\u2019s leg out from under him and leapt over him when he fell, thrusting his torch into the stone man\u2019s face to send him stumbling backwards on his shattered leg, flailing at the flames with stiff grey hands. The dwarf waddled after him, slashing with the torch, jabbing it at the stone man\u2019s eyes. A little farther. Back, one more step, another. They were at the edge of the deck when the creature rushed him, grabbed the torch, and ripped it from his hands. Bugger me, thought Tyrion.\nThe stone man flung the torch away. There was a soft hiss as the black waters quenched the flames. The stone man howled. He had been a Summer Islander, before; his jaw and half his cheek had turned to stone, but his skin was black as midnight where it was not grey. Where he had grasped the torch, his skin had cracked and split. Blood was seeping from his knuckles though he did not seem to feel it. That was some small mercy, Tyrion supposed. Though mortal, greyscale was supposedly not painful.\n\u201cStand aside!\u201d someone shouted, far away, and another voice said, \u201cThe prince! Protect the boy!\u201d The stone man staggered forward, his hands outstretched and grasping.\nTyrion drove a shoulder into him.\nIt felt like slamming into a castle wall, but this castle stood upon a shattered leg. The stone man went over backwards, grabbing hold of Tyrion as he fell. They hit the river with a towering splash, and Mother Rhoyne swallowed up the two of them.\nThe sudden cold hit Tyrion like a hammer. As he sank he felt a stone hand fumbling at his face. Another closed around his arm, dragging him down into darkness. Blind, his nose full of river, choking, sinking, he kicked and twisted and fought to pry the clutching fingers off his arm, but the stone fingers were unyielding. Air bubbled from his lips. The world was black and growing blacker. He could not breathe.\nThere are worse ways to die than drowning. And if truth be told, he had perished long ago, back in King\u2019s Landing. It was only his revenant who remained, the small vengeful ghost who throttled Shae and put a crossbow bolt through the great Lord Tywin\u2019s bowels. No man would mourn the thing that he\u2019d become. I\u2019ll haunt the Seven Kingdoms, he thought, sinking deeper. They would not love me living, so let them dread me dead.\nWhen he opened his mouth to curse them all, black water filled his lungs, and the dark closed in around him.",

      "content": "DAVOS\nHis lordship will hear you now, smuggler.\u201d\nThe knight wore silver armor, his greaves and gauntlet inlaid with niello to suggest flowing fronds of seaweed. The helm beneath his arm was the head of the merling king, with a crown of mother-of-pearl and a jutting beard of jet and jade. His own beard was as grey as the winter sea.\nDavos rose. \u201cMay I know your name, ser?\u201d\n\u201cSer Marlon Manderly.\u201d He was a head taller than Davos and three stones heavier, with slate-grey eyes and a haughty way of speaking. \u201cI have the honor to be Lord Wyman\u2019s cousin and commander of his garrison. Follow me.\u201d\nDavos had come to White Harbor as an envoy, but they had made him a captive. His chambers were large, airy, and handsomely furnished, but there were guards outside his doors. From his window he could see the streets of White Harbor beyond the castle walls, but he was not allowed to walk them. He could see the harbor too, and had watched Merry Midwife make her way down the firth. Casso Mogat had waited four days instead of three before departing. Another fortnight had passed since then.\nLord Manderly\u2019s household guard wore cloaks of blue-green wool and carried silver tridents in place of common spears. One went before him, one behind, and one to either side. They walked past the faded banners, broken shields, and rusted swords of a hundred ancient victories, and a score of wooden figures, cracked and worm-riddled, that could only have adorned the prows of ships.\nTwo marble mermen flanked his lordship\u2019s court, Fishfoot\u2019s smaller cousins. As the guards threw open the doors, a herald slammed the butt of his staff against an old plank floor. \u201cSer Davos of House Seaworth,\u201d he called in a ringing voice.\nAs many times as he had visited White Harbor, Davos had never set foot inside the New Castle, much less the Merman\u2019s Court. Its walls and floor and ceiling were made of wooden planks notched cunningly together and decorated with all the creatures of the sea. As they approached the dais, Davos trod on painted crabs and clams and starfish, half-hidden amongst twisting black fronds of seaweed and the bones of drowned sailors. On the walls to either side, pale sharks prowled painted blue-green depths, whilst eels and octopods slithered amongst rocks and sunken ships. Shoals of herring and great codfish swam between the tall arched windows. Higher up, near where the old fishing nets drooped down from the rafters, the surface of the sea had been depicted. To his right a war galley stroked serene against the rising sun; to his left, a battered old cog raced before a storm, her sails in rags. Behind the dais a kraken and grey leviathan were locked in battle beneath the painted waves.\nDavos had hoped to speak with Wyman Manderly alone, but he found a crowded court. Along the walls, the women outnumbered the men by five to one; what few males he did see had long grey beards or looked too young to shave. There were septons as well, and holy sisters in white robes and grey. Near the top of the hall stood a dozen men in the blue and silver-grey of House Frey. Their faces had a likeness a blind man could have seen; several wore the badge of the Twins, two towers connected by a bridge.\nDavos had learned to read men\u2019s faces long before Maester Pylos had taught him to read words on paper. These Freys would gladly see me dead, he realized at a glance.\nNor did he find any welcome in the pale blue eyes of Wyman Manderly. His lordship\u2019s cushioned throne was wide enough to accommodate three men of common girth, yet Manderly threatened to overflow it. His lordship sagged into his seat, his shoulders slumped, his legs splayed, his hands resting on the arms of his throne as if the weight of them were too much to bear. Gods be good, thought Davos, when he saw Lord Wyman\u2019s face, this man looks half a corpse. His skin was pallid, with an undertone of grey.\nKings and corpses always draw attendants, the old saying went. So it was with Manderly. Left of the high seat stood a maester nigh as fat as the lord he served, a rosy-cheeked man with thick lips and a head of golden curls. Ser Marlon claimed the place of honor at his lordship\u2019s right hand. On a cushioned stool at his feet perched a plump pink lady. Behind Lord Wyman stood two younger women, sisters by the look of them. The elder wore her brown hair bound in a long braid. The younger, no more than fifteen, had an even longer braid, dyed a garish green.\nNone chose to honor Davos with a name. The maester was the first to speak. \u201cYou stand before Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor and Warden of the White Knife, Shield of the Faith, Defender of the Dispossessed, Lord Marshal of the Mander, a Knight of the Order of the Green Hand,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Merman\u2019s Court, it is customary for vassals and petitioners to kneel.\u201d\nThe onion knight would have bent his knee, but a King\u2019s Hand could not; to do so would suggest that the king he served was less than this fat lord. \u201cI have not come as a petitioner,\u201d Davos replied. \u201cI have a string of titles too. Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, Hand of the King.\u201d\nThe plump woman on the stool rolled her eyes. \u201cAn admiral without ships, a hand without fingers, in service to a king without a throne. Is this a knight who comes before us, or the answer to a child\u2019s riddle?\u201d\n\u201cHe is a messenger, good-daughter,\u201d Lord Wyman said, \u201can onion of ill omen. Stannis did not like the answer his ravens brought him, so he has sent this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this smuggler.\u201d He squinted at Davos through eyes half-buried in rolls of fat. \u201cYou have visited our city before, I think, taking coin from our pockets and food off our table. How much did you steal from me, I wonder?\u201d\nNot enough that you ever missed a meal. \u201cI paid for my smuggling at Storm\u2019s End, my lord.\u201d Davos pulled off his glove and held up his left hand, with its four shortened fingers.\n\u201cFour fingertips, for a lifetime\u2019s worth of theft?\u201d said the woman on the stool. Her hair was yellow, her face round and pink and fleshy. \u201cYou got off cheaply, Onion Knight.\u201d\nDavos did not deny it. \u201cIf it please my lord, I would request a privy audience.\u201d\nIt did not please the lord. \u201cI keep no secrets from my kin, nor from my leal lords and knights, good friends all.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d said Davos, \u201cI would not want my words to be heard by His Grace\u2019s enemies\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or by your lordship\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cStannis may have enemies in this hall. I do not.\u201d\n\u201cNot even the men who slew your son?\u201d Davos pointed. \u201cThese Freys were amongst his hosts at the Red Wedding.\u201d\nOne of the Freys stepped forward, a knight long and lean of limb, clean-shaved but for a grey mustache as thin as a Myrish stiletto. \u201cThe Red Wedding was the Young Wolf\u2019s work. He changed into a beast before our eyes and tore out the throat of my cousin Jinglebell, a harmless simpleton. He would have slain my lord father too, if Ser Wendel had not put himself in the way.\u201d\nLord Wyman blinked back tears. \u201cWendel was always a brave boy. I was not surprised to learn he died a hero.\u201d\nThe enormity of the lie made Davos gasp. \u201cIs it your claim that Robb Stark killed Wendel Manderly?\u201d he asked the Frey.\n\u201cAnd many more. Mine own son Tytos was amongst them, and my daughter\u2019s husband. When Stark changed into a wolf, his northmen did the same. The mark of the beast was on them all. Wargs birth other wargs with a bite, it is well-known. It was all my brothers and I could do to put them down before they slew us all.\u201d\nThe man was smirking as he told the tale. Davos wanted to peel his lips off with a knife. \u201cSer, may I have your name?\u201d\n\u201cSer Jared, of House Frey.\u201d\n\u201cJared of House Frey, I name you liar.\u201d\nSer Jared seemed amused. \u201cSome men cry when slicing onions, but I have never had that weakness.\u201d Steel whispered against leather as he drew his sword. \u201cIf you are indeed a knight, ser, defend that slander with your body.\u201d\nLord Wyman\u2019s eyes fluttered open. \u201cI\u2019ll have no bloodshed in the Merman\u2019s Court. Put up your steel, Ser Jared, else I must ask you to leave my presence.\u201d\nSer Jared sheathed his sword. \u201cBeneath your lordship\u2019s roof, your lordship\u2019s word is law\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I shall want a reckoning with this onion lord before he leaves this city.\u201d\n\u201cBlood!\u201d howled the woman on the stool. \u201cThat\u2019s what this ill onion wants of us, my lord. See how he stirs up trouble? Send him away, I beg you. He wants the blood of your people, the blood of your brave sons. Send him away. Should the queen hear that you gave audience to this traitor, she may question our own loyalty. She might\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she could\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt will not come to that, good-daughter,\u201d Lord Wyman said. \u201cThe Iron Throne shall have no cause to doubt us.\u201d\nDavos misliked the sound of that, but he had not come all this way to hold his tongue. \u201cThe boy on the Iron Throne is a usurper,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am no traitor, but the Hand of Stannis Baratheon, the First of His Name, the trueborn King of Westeros.\u201d\nThe fat maester cleared his throat. \u201cStannis Baratheon was brother to our late King Robert, may the Father judge him justly. Tommen is the issue of Robert\u2019s body. The laws of succession are clear in such a case. A son must come before a brother.\u201d\n\u201cMaester Theomore speaks truly,\u201d said Lord Wyman. \u201cHe is wise in all such matters, and has always given me good counsel.\u201d\n\u201cA trueborn son comes before a brother,\u201d Davos agreed, \u201cbut Tommen-called-Baratheon is bastard-born, as his brother Joffrey was before him. They were sired by the Kingslayer, in defiance of all the laws of gods and men.\u201d\nAnother of the Freys spoke up. \u201cHe speaks treason with his own lips, my lord. Stannis took his thieving fingers. You should take his lying tongue.\u201d\n\u201cTake his head, rather,\u201d suggested Ser Jared. \u201cOr let him meet me on the field of honor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would a Frey know of honor?\u201d Davos threw back.\nFour of the Freys started forward until Lord Wyman halted them with an upraised hand. \u201cStep back, my friends. I will hear him out before I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0before I deal with him.\u201d\n\u201cCan you offer any proof of this incest, ser?\u201d Maester Theomore asked, folding his soft hands atop his belly.\nEdric Storm, thought Davos, but I sent him far away across the narrow sea, to keep him safe from Melisandre\u2019s fires. \u201cYou have the word of Stannis Baratheon that all I\u2019ve said is true.\u201d\n\u201cWords are wind,\u201d said the young woman behind Lord Wyman\u2019s high seat, the handsome one with the long brown braid. \u201cAnd men will lie to get their way, as any maid could tell you.\u201d\n\u201cProof requires more than some lord\u2019s unsupported word,\u201d declared Maester Theomore. \u201cStannis Baratheon would not be the first man who ever lied to win a throne.\u201d\nThe pink woman pointed a plump finger down at Davos. \u201cWe want no part of any treason, you. We are good people in White Harbor, lawful, loyal people. Pour no more poison in our ears, or my good-father will send you to the Wolf\u2019s Den.\u201d\nHow have I offended this one? \u201cMight I have the honor of my lady\u2019s name?\u201d\nThe pink woman gave an angry sniff and let the maester answer. \u201cThe Lady Leona is wife to Lord Wyman\u2019s son Ser Wylis, presently a captive of the Lannisters.\u201d\nShe speaks from fear. If White Harbor should declare for Stannis, her husband would answer with his life. How can I ask Lord Wyman to condemn his son to death? What would I do in his place if Devan were a hostage? \u201cMy lord,\u201d said Davos, \u201cI pray no harm will come to your son, or to any man of White Harbor.\u201d\n\u201cAnother lie,\u201d said Lady Leona from her stool.\nDavos thought it best to ignore her. \u201cWhen Robb Stark took up arms against the bastard Joffrey-called-Baratheon, White Harbor marched with him. Lord Stark has fallen, but his war goes on.\u201d\n\u201cRobb Stark was my liege lord,\u201d said Lord Wyman. \u201cWho is this man Stannis? Why does he trouble us? He never felt the need to journey north before, as best I can recall. Yet he turns up now, a beaten cur with his helm in his hand, begging for alms.\u201d\n\u201cHe came to save the realm, my lord,\u201d Davos insisted. \u201cTo defend your lands against the ironborn and the wildlings.\u201d\nNext to the high seat, Ser Marlon Manderly gave a snort of disdain. \u201cIt has been centuries since White Harbor has seen any wildlings, and the ironmen have never troubled this coast. Does Lord Stannis propose to defend us from snarks and dragons too?\u201d\nLaughter swept the Merman\u2019s Court, but at Lord Wyman\u2019s feet, Lady Leona began to sob. \u201cIronmen from the isles, wildlings from beyond the Wall\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and now this traitor lord with his outlaws, rebels, and sorcerers.\u201d She pointed a finger at Davos. \u201cWe have heard of your red witch, oh yes. She would turn us against the Seven to bow before a fire demon!\u201d\nDavos had no love for the red priestess, but he dare not let Lady Leona go unanswered. \u201cLady Melisandre is a priestess of the red god. Queen Selyse has adopted her faith, along with many others, but more of His Grace\u2019s followers still worship the Seven. Myself among them.\u201d He prayed no one would ask him to explain about the sept at Dragonstone or the godswood at Storm\u2019s End. If they ask, I must needs tell them. Stannis would not have me lie.\n\u201cThe Seven defend White Harbor,\u201d Lady Leona declared. \u201cWe do not fear your red queen or her god. Let her send what spells she will. The prayers of godly men will shield us against evil.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lord Wyman gave Lady Leona a pat on the shoulder. \u201cLord Davos, if you are a lord, I know what your so-called king would have of me. Steel and silver and a bended knee.\u201d He shifted his weight to lean upon an elbow. \u201cBefore he was slain, Lord Tywin offered White Harbor full pardon for our support of the Young Wolf. He promised that my son would be returned to me once I paid a ransom of three thousand dragons and proved my loyalty beyond a doubt. Roose Bolton, who is named our Warden of the North, requires that I give up my claim to Lord Hornwood\u2019s lands and castles but swears my other holdings shall remain untouched. Walder Frey, his good-father, offers one of his daughters to be my wife, and husbands for my son\u2019s daughters here behind me. These terms seem generous to me, a good basis for a fair and lasting peace. You would have me spurn them. So I ask you, Onion Knight\u2014what does Lord Stannis offer me in return for my allegiance?\u201d\nWar and woe and the screams of burning men, Davos might have said. \u201cThe chance to do your duty,\u201d he replied instead. That was the answer Stannis would have given Wyman Manderly. The Hand should speak with the king\u2019s voice.\nLord Wyman sagged back in his chair. \u201cDuty. I see.\u201d\n\u201cWhite Harbor is not strong enough to stand alone. You need His Grace as much as he needs you. Together you can defeat your common enemies.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d said Ser Marlon, in his ornate silver armor, \u201cwill you permit me to ask a few questions of Lord Davos?\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, cousin.\u201d Lord Wyman closed his eyes.\nSer Marlon turned to Davos. \u201cHow many northern lords have declared for Stannis? Tell us that.\u201d\n\u201cArnolf Karstark has vowed to join His Grace.\u201d\n\u201cArnolf is no true lord, only a castellan. What castles does Lord Stannis hold at present, pray?\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace has taken the Nightfort for his seat. In the south, he holds Storm\u2019s End and Dragonstone.\u201d\nMaester Theomore cleared his throat. \u201cOnly for the nonce. Storm\u2019s End and Dragonstone are lightly held and must soon fall. And the Nightfort is a haunted ruin, a drear and dreadful place.\u201d\nSer Marlon went on. \u201cHow many men can Stannis put into the field, can you tell us that? How many knights ride with him? How many bowmen, how many freeriders, how many men-at-arms?\u201d\nToo few, Davos knew. Stannis had come north with no more than fifteen hundred men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if he told them that, his mission here was doomed. He fumbled for words and found none.\n\u201cYour silence is all the answer I require, ser. Your king brings us only enemies.\u201d Ser Marlon turned to his lord cousin. \u201cYour lordship asked the onion knight what Stannis offers us. Let me answer. He offers us defeat and death. He would have you mount a horse of air and give battle with a sword of wind.\u201d\nThe fat lord opened his eyes slowly, as if the effort were almost too much for him. \u201cMy cousin cuts to the bone, as ever. Do you have any more to say to me, Onion Knight, or can we put an end to this mummer\u2019s farce? I grow weary of your face.\u201d\nDavos felt a stab of despair. His Grace should have sent another man, a lord or knight or maester, someone who could speak for him without tripping on his own tongue. \u201cDeath,\u201d he heard himself say, \u201cthere will be death, aye. Your lordship lost a son at the Red Wedding. I lost four upon the Blackwater. And why? Because the Lannisters stole the throne. Go to King\u2019s Landing and look on Tommen with your own eyes, if you doubt me. A blind man could see it. What does Stannis offer you? Vengeance. Vengeance for my sons and yours, for your husbands and your fathers and your brothers. Vengeance for your murdered lord, your murdered king, your butchered princes. Vengeance!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d piped a girl\u2019s voice, thin and high.\nIt belonged to the half-grown child with the blond eyebrows and the long green braid. \u201cThey killed Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn and King Robb,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was our king! He was brave and good, and the Freys murdered him. If Lord Stannis will avenge him, we should join Lord Stannis.\u201d\nManderly pulled her close. \u201cWylla, every time you open your mouth you make me want to send you to the silent sisters.\u201d\n\u201cI only said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe heard what you said,\u201d said the older girl, her sister. \u201cA child\u2019s foolishness. Speak no ill of our friends of Frey. One of them will be your lord and husband soon.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the girl declared, shaking her head. \u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t ever. They killed the king.\u201d\nLord Wyman flushed. \u201cYou will. When the appointed day arrives, you will speak your wedding vows, else you will join the silent sisters and never speak again.\u201d\nThe poor girl looked stricken. \u201cGrandfather, please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHush, child,\u201d said Lady Leona. \u201cYou heard your lord grandfather. Hush! You know nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI know about the promise,\u201d insisted the girl. \u201cMaester Theomore, tell them! A thousand years before the Conquest, a promise was made, and oaths were sworn in the Wolf\u2019s Den before the old gods and the new. When we were sore beset and friendless, hounded from our homes and in peril of our lives, the wolves took us in and nourished us and protected us against our enemies. The city is built upon the land they gave us. In return we swore that we should always be their men. Stark men!\u201d\nThe maester fingered the chain about his neck. \u201cSolemn oaths were sworn to the Starks of Winterfell, aye. But Winterfell has fallen and House Stark has been extinguished.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because they killed them all!\u201d\nAnother Frey spoke up. \u201cLord Wyman, if I may?\u201d\nWyman Manderly gave him a nod. \u201cRhaegar. We are always pleased to hear your noble counsel.\u201d\nRhaegar Frey acknowledged the compliment with a bow. He was thirty, or nigh unto, round-shouldered and kettle-bellied, but richly dressed in a doublet of soft grey lambswool trimmed in cloth-of-silver. His cloak was cloth-of-silver too, lined with vair and clasped at the collar with a brooch in the shape of the twin towers. \u201cLady Wylla,\u201d he said to the girl with the green braid, \u201cloyalty is a virtue. I hope you will be as loyal to Little Walder when you are joined in wedlock. As to the Starks, that House is extinguished only in the male line. Lord Eddard\u2019s sons are dead, but his daughters live, and the younger girl is coming north to wed brave Ramsay Bolton.\u201d\n\u201cRamsay Snow,\u201d Wylla Manderly threw back.\n\u201cHave it as you will. By any name, he shall soon be wed to Arya Stark. If you would keep faith with your promise, give him your allegiance, for he shall be your Lord of Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t ever be my lord! He made Lady Hornwood marry him, then shut her in a dungeon and made her eat her fingers.\u201d\nA murmur of assent swept the Merman\u2019s Court. \u201cThe maid tells it true,\u201d declared a stocky man in white and purple, whose cloak was fastened with a pair of crossed bronze keys. \u201cRoose Bolton\u2019s cold and cunning, aye, but a man can deal with Roose. We\u2019ve all known worse. But this bastard son of his\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they say he\u2019s mad and cruel, a monster.\u201d\n\u201cThey say?\u201d Rhaegar Frey sported a silky beard and a sardonic smile. \u201cHis enemies say, aye\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but it was the Young Wolf who was the monster. More beast than boy, that one, puffed up with pride and bloodlust. And he was faithless, as my lord grandfather learned to his sorrow.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cI do not fault White Harbor for supporting him. My grandsire made the same grievous mistake. In all the Young Wolf\u2019s battles, White Harbor and the Twins fought side by side beneath his banners. Robb Stark betrayed us all. He abandoned the north to the cruel mercies of the ironmen to carve out a fairer kingdom for himself along the Trident. Then he abandoned the riverlords who had risked much and more for him, breaking his marriage pact with my grandfather to wed the first western wench who caught his eye. The Young Wolf? He was a vile dog and died like one.\u201d\nThe Merman\u2019s Court had grown still. Davos could feel the chill in the air. Lord Wyman was looking down at Rhaegar as if he were a roach in need of a hard heel\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet then, abruptly, he gave a ponderous nod that set his chins to wobbling. \u201cA dog, aye. He brought us only grief and death. A vile dog indeed. Say on.\u201d\nRhaegar Frey went on. \u201cGrief and death, aye\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and this onion lord will bring you more with his talk of vengeance. Open your eyes, as my lord grandsire did. The War of the Five Kings is all but done. Tommen is our king, our only king. We must help him bind up the wounds of this sad war. As Robert\u2019s trueborn son, the heir of stag and lion, the Iron Throne is his by rights.\u201d\n\u201cWise words, and true,\u201d said Lord Wyman Manderly.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t.\u201d Wylla Manderly stamped her foot.\n\u201cBe quiet, wretched child,\u201d scolded Lady Leona. \u201cYoung girls should be an ornament to the eye, not an ache in the ear.\u201d She seized the girl by her braid and pulled her squealing from the hall. There went my only friend in this hall, thought Davos.\n\u201cWylla has always been a willful child,\u201d her sister said, by way of apology. \u201cI fear that she will make a willful wife.\u201d\nRhaegar shrugged. \u201cMarriage will soften her, I have no doubt. A firm hand and a quiet word.\u201d\n\u201cIf not, there are the silent sisters.\u201d Lord Wyman shifted in his seat. \u201cAs for you, Onion Knight, I have heard sufficient treason for one day. You would have me risk my city for a false king and a false god. You would have me sacrifice my only living son so Stannis Baratheon can plant his puckered arse upon a throne to which he has no right. I will not do it. Not for you. Not for your lord. Not for any man.\u201d The Lord of White Harbor pushed himself to his feet. The effort brought a red flush to his neck. \u201cYou are still a smuggler, ser, come to steal my gold and blood. You would take my son\u2019s head. I think I shall take yours instead. Guards! Seize this man!\u201d\nBefore Davos could even think to move, he was surrounded by silver tridents. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, \u201cI am an envoy.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? You came sneaking into my city like a smuggler. I say you are no lord, no knight, no envoy, only a thief and a spy, a peddler of lies and treasons. I should tear your tongue out with hot pincers and deliver you to the Dreadfort to be flayed. But the Mother is merciful, and so am I.\u201d He beckoned to Ser Marlon. \u201cCousin, take this creature to the Wolf\u2019s Den and cut off his head and hands. I want them brought to me before I sup. I shall not be able to eat a bite until I see this smuggler\u2019s head upon a spike, with an onion shoved between his lying teeth.\u201d",

      "content": "REEK\nThey gave him a horse and a banner, a soft woolen doublet and a warm fur cloak, and set him loose. For once, he did not stink. \u201cCome back with that castle,\u201d said Damon Dance-for-Me as he helped Reek climb shaking into the saddle, \u201cor keep going and see how far you get before we catch you. He\u2019d like that, he would.\u201d Grinning, Damon gave the horse a lick across the rump with his whip, and the old stot whinnied and lurched into motion.\nReek did not dare to look back, for fear that Damon and Yellow Dick and Grunt and the rest were coming after him, that all of this was just another of Lord Ramsay\u2019s japes, some cruel test to see what he would do if they gave him a horse and set him free. Do they think that I will run? The stot they had given him was a wretched thing, knock-kneed and half-starved; he could never hope to outdistance the fine horses Lord Ramsay and his hunters would be riding. And Ramsay loved nothing more than to set his girls baying on the trail of some fresh prey.\nBesides, where would he run to? Behind him were the camps, crowded with Dreadfort men and those the Ryswells had brought from the Rills, with the Barrowton host between them. South of Moat Cailin, another army was coming up the causeway, an army of Boltons and Freys marching beneath the banners of the Dreadfort. East of the road lay a bleak and barren shore and a cold salt sea, to the west the swamps and bogs of the Neck, infested with serpents, lizard lions, and bog devils with their poisoned arrows.\nHe would not run. He could not run.\nI will deliver him the castle. I will. I must.\nIt was a grey day, damp and misty. The wind was from the south, moist as a kiss. The ruins of Moat Cailin were visible in the distance, threaded through with wisps of morning mist. His horse moved toward them at a walk, her hooves making faint wet squelching sounds as they pulled free of the grey-green muck.\nI have come this way before. It was a dangerous thought, and he regretted it at once. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cno, that was some other man, that was before you knew your name.\u201d His name was Reek. He had to remember that. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with leek.\nWhen that other man had come this way, an army had followed close behind him, the great host of the north riding to war beneath the grey-and-white banners of House Stark. Reek rode alone, clutching a peace banner on a pinewood staff. When that other man had come this way, he had been mounted on a courser, swift and spirited. Reek rode a broken-down stot, all skin and bone and ribs, and he rode her slowly for fear he might fall off. The other man had been a good rider, but Reek was uneasy on horseback. It had been so long. He was no rider. He was not even a man. He was Lord Ramsay\u2019s creature, lower than a dog, a worm in human skin. \u201cYou will pretend to be a prince,\u201d Lord Ramsay told him last night, as Reek was soaking in a tub of scalding water, \u201cbut we know the truth. You\u2019re Reek. You\u2019ll always be Reek, no matter how sweet you smell. Your nose may lie to you. Remember your name. Remember who you are.\u201d\n\u201cReek,\u201d he said. \u201cYour Reek.\u201d\n\u201cDo this little thing for me, and you can be my dog and eat meat every day,\u201d Lord Ramsay promised. \u201cYou will be tempted to betray me. To run or fight or join our foes. No, quiet, I\u2019ll not hear you deny it. Lie to me, and I\u2019ll take your tongue. A man would turn against me in your place, but we know what you are, don\u2019t we? Betray me if you want, it makes no matter\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but count your fingers first and know the cost.\u201d\nReek knew the cost. Seven, he thought, seven fingers. A man can make do with seven fingers. Seven is a sacred number. He remembered how much it had hurt when Lord Ramsay had commanded Skinner to lay his ring finger bare.\nThe air was wet and heavy, and shallow pools of water dotted the ground. Reek picked his way between them carefully, following the remnants of the log-and-plank road that Robb Stark\u2019s vanguard had laid down across the soft ground to speed the passage of his host. Where once a mighty curtain wall had stood, only scattered stones remained, blocks of black basalt so large it must once have taken a hundred men to hoist them into place. Some had sunk so deep into the bog that only a corner showed; others lay strewn about like some god\u2019s abandoned toys, cracked and crumbling, spotted with lichen. Last night\u2019s rain had left the huge stones wet and glistening, and the morning sunlight made them look as if they were coated in some fine black oil.\nBeyond stood the towers.\nThe Drunkard\u2019s Tower leaned as if it were about to collapse, just as it had for half a thousand years. The Children\u2019s Tower thrust into the sky as straight as a spear, but its shattered top was open to the wind and rain. The Gatehouse Tower, squat and wide, was the largest of the three, slimy with moss, a gnarled tree growing sideways from the stones of its north side, fragments of broken wall still standing to the east and west. The Karstarks took the Drunkard\u2019s Tower and the Umbers the Children\u2019s Tower, he recalled. Robb claimed the Gatehouse Tower for his own.\nIf he closed his eyes, he could see the banners in his mind\u2019s eye, snapping bravely in a brisk north wind. All gone now, all fallen. The wind on his cheeks was blowing from the south, and the only banners flying above the remains of Moat Cailin displayed a golden kraken on a field of black.\nHe was being watched. He could feel the eyes. When he looked up, he caught a glimpse of pale faces peering from behind the battlements of the Gatehouse Tower and through the broken masonry that crowned the Children\u2019s Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called down the hammer of the waters to break the lands of Westeros in two.\nThe only dry road through the Neck was the causeway, and the towers of Moat Cailin plugged its northern end like a cork in a bottle. The road was narrow, the ruins so positioned that any enemy coming up from the south must pass beneath and between them. To assault any of the three towers, an attacker must expose his back to arrows from the other two, whilst climbing damp stone walls festooned with streamers of slimy white ghostskin. The swampy ground beyond the causeway was impassable, an endless morass of suckholes, quicksands, and glistening green swards that looked solid to the unwary eye but turned to water the instant you trod upon them, the whole of it infested with venomous serpents and poisonous flowers and monstrous lizard lions with teeth like daggers. Just as dangerous were its people, seldom seen but always lurking, the swamp-dwellers, the frog-eaters, the mud-men. Fenn and Reed, Peat and Boggs, Cray and Quagg, Greengood and Blackmyre, those were the sorts of names they gave themselves. The ironborn called them all bog devils.\nReek passed the rotted carcass of a horse, an arrow jutting from its neck. A long white snake slithered into its empty eye socket at his approach. Behind the horse he spied the rider, or what remained of him. The crows had stripped the flesh from the man\u2019s face, and a feral dog had burrowed beneath his mail to get at his entrails. Farther on, another corpse had sunk so deep into the muck that only his face and fingers showed.\nCloser to the towers, corpses littered the ground on every side. Blood-blooms had sprouted from their gaping wounds, pale flowers with petals plump and moist as a woman\u2019s lips.\nThe garrison will never know me. Some might recall the boy he\u2019d been before he learned his name, but Reek would be a stranger to them. It had been a long while since he last looked into a glass, but he knew how old he must appear. His hair had turned white; much of it had fallen out, and what was left was stiff and dry as straw. The dungeons had left him weak as an old woman and so thin a strong wind could knock him down.\nAnd his hands\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ramsay had given him gloves, fine gloves of black leather, soft and supple, stuffed with wool to conceal his missing fingers, but if anyone looked closely, he would see that three of his fingers did not bend.\n\u201cNo closer!\u201d a voice rang out. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cWords.\u201d He spurred the stot onward, waving the peace banner so they could not fail to see it. \u201cI come unarmed.\u201d\nThere was no reply. Inside the walls, he knew, the ironmen were discussing whether to admit him or fill his chest with arrows. It makes no matter. A quick death here would be a hundred times better than returning to Lord Ramsay as a failure.\nThen the gatehouse doors flung open. \u201cQuickly.\u201d Reek was turning toward the sound when the arrow struck. It came from somewhere to his right, where broken chunks of the curtain wall lay half-submerged beneath the bog. The shaft tore through the folds of his banner and hung spent, the point a bare foot from his face. It startled him so badly that he dropped the peace banner and tumbled from his saddle.\n\u201cInside,\u201d the voice shouted, \u201churry, fool, hurry!\u201d\nReek scrambled up the steps on hands and knees as another arrow fluttered over his head. Someone seized him and dragged him inside, and he heard the door crash shut behind him. He was pulled to his feet and shoved against a wall. Then a knife was at his throat, a bearded face so close to his that he could count the man\u2019s nose hairs. \u201cWho are you? What\u2019s your purpose here? Quick now, or I\u2019ll do you the same as him.\u201d The guard jerked his head toward a body rotting on the floor beside the door, its flesh green and crawling with maggots.\n\u201cI am ironborn,\u201d Reek answered, lying. The boy he\u2019d been before had been ironborn, true enough, but Reek had come into this world in the dungeons of the Dreadfort. \u201cLook at my face. I am Lord Balon\u2019s son. Your prince.\u201d He would have said the name, but somehow the words caught in his throat. Reek, I\u2019m Reek, it rhymes with squeak. He had to forget that for a little while, though. No man would ever yield to a creature such as Reek, no matter how desperate his situation. He must pretend to be a prince again.\nHis captor stared at his face, squinting, his mouth twisted in suspicion. His teeth were brown, and his breath stank of ale and onion. \u201cLord Balon\u2019s sons were killed.\u201d\n\u201cMy brothers. Not me. Lord Ramsay took me captive after Winterfell. He\u2019s sent me here to treat with you. Do you command here?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d The man lowered his knife and took a step backwards, almost stumbling over the corpse. \u201cNot me, m\u2019lord.\u201d His mail was rusted, his leathers rotting. On the back of one hand an open sore wept blood. \u201cRalf Kenning has the command. The captain said. I\u2019m on the door, is all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d Reek gave the corpse a kick.\nThe guard stared at the dead man as if seeing him for the first time. \u201cHim\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he drank the water. I had to cut his throat for him, to stop his screaming. Bad belly. You can\u2019t drink the water. That\u2019s why we got the ale.\u201d The guard rubbed his face, his eyes red and inflamed. \u201cWe used to drag the dead down into the cellars. All the vaults are flooded down there. No one wants to take the trouble now, so we just leave them where they fall.\u201d\n\u201cThe cellar is a better place for them. Give them to the water. To the Drowned God.\u201d\nThe man laughed. \u201cNo gods down there, m\u2019lord. Only rats and water snakes. White things, thick as your leg. Sometimes they slither up the steps and bite you in your sleep.\u201d\nReek remembered the dungeons underneath the Dreadfort, the rat squirming between his teeth, the taste of warm blood on his lips. If I fail, Ramsay will send me back to that, but first he\u2019ll flay the skin from another finger. \u201cHow many of the garrison are left?\u201d\n\u201cSome,\u201d said the ironman. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Fewer than we was before. Some in the Drunkard\u2019s Tower too, I think. Not the Children\u2019s Tower. Dagon Codd went over there a few days back. Only two men left alive, he said, and they was eating on the dead ones. He killed them both, if you can believe that.\u201d\nMoat Cailin has fallen, Reek realized then, only no one has seen fit to tell them. He rubbed his mouth to hide his broken teeth, and said, \u201cI need to speak with your commander.\u201d\n\u201cKenning?\u201d The guard seemed confused. \u201cHe don\u2019t have much to say these days. He\u2019s dying. Might be he\u2019s dead. I haven\u2019t seen him since\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t remember when\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he? Take me to him.\u201d\n\u201cWho will keep the door, then?\u201d\n\u201cHim.\u201d Reek gave the corpse a kick.\nThat made the man laugh. \u201cAye. Why not? Come with me, then.\u201d He pulled a torch down from a wall sconce and waved it till it blazed up bright and hot. \u201cThis way.\u201d The guard led him through a door and up a spiral stair, the torchlight glimmering off black stone walls as they climbed.\nThe chamber at the top of the steps was dark, smoky, and oppressively hot. A ragged skin had been hung across the narrow window to keep the damp out, and a slab of peat smoldered in a brazier. The smell in the room was foul, a miasma of mold and piss and nightsoil, of smoke and sickness. Soiled rushes covered the floor, whilst a heap of straw in the corner passed for a bed.\nRalf Kenning lay shivering beneath a mountain of furs. His arms were stacked beside him\u2014sword and axe, mail hauberk, iron warhelm. His shield bore the storm god\u2019s cloudy hand, lightning crackling from his fingers down to a raging sea, but the paint was discolored and peeling, the wood beneath starting to rot.\nRalf was rotting too. Beneath the furs he was naked and feverish, his pale puffy flesh covered with weeping sores and scabs. His head was misshapen, one cheek grotesquely swollen, his neck so engorged with blood that it threatened to swallow his face. The arm on that same side was big as a log and crawling with white worms. No one had bathed him or shaved him for many days, from the look of him. One eye wept pus, and his beard was crusty with dried vomit. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d asked Reek.\n\u201cHe was on the parapets and some bog devil loosed an arrow at him. It was only a graze, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they poison their shafts, smear the points with shit and worse things. We poured boiling wine into the wound, but it made no difference.\u201d\nI cannot treat with this thing. \u201cKill him,\u201d Reek told the guard. \u201cHis wits are gone. He\u2019s full of blood and worms.\u201d\nThe man gaped at him. \u201cThe captain put him in command.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d put a dying horse down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat horse? I never had no horse.\u201d\nI did. The memory came back in a rush. Smiler\u2019s screams had sounded almost human. His mane afire, he had reared up on his hind legs, blind with pain, lashing out with his hooves. No, no. Not mine, he was not mine, Reek never had a horse. \u201cI will kill him for you.\u201d Reek snatched up Ralf Kenning\u2019s sword where it leaned against his shield. He still had fingers enough to clasp the hilt. When he laid the edge of the blade against the swollen throat of the creature on the straw, the skin split open in a gout of black blood and yellow pus. Kenning jerked violently, then lay still. An awful stench filled the room. Reek bolted for the steps. The air was damp and cold there, but much cleaner by comparison. The ironman stumbled out after him, white-faced and struggling not to retch. Reek grasped him by the arm. \u201cWho was second-in-command? Where are the rest of the men?\u201d\n\u201cUp on the battlements, or in the hall. Sleeping, drinking. I\u2019ll take you if you like.\u201d\n\u201cDo it now.\u201d Ramsay had only given him a day.\nThe hall was dark stone, high ceilinged and drafty, full of drifting smoke, its stone walls spotted by huge patches of pale lichen. A peat fire burned low in a hearth blackened by the hotter blazes of years past. A massive table of carved stone filled the chamber, as it had for centuries. There was where I sat, the last time I was here, he remembered. Robb was at the head of the table, with the Greatjon to his right and Roose Bolton on his left. The Glovers sat next to Helman Tallhart. Karstark and his sons were across from them.\nTwo dozen ironborn sat drinking at the table. A few looked at him with dull, flat eyes when he entered. The rest ignored him. All the men were strangers to him. Several wore cloaks fastened by brooches in the shape of silver codfish. The Codds were not well regarded in the Iron Islands; the men were said to be thieves and cowards, the women wantons who bedded with their own fathers and brothers. It did not surprise him that his uncle had chosen to leave these men behind when the Iron Fleet went home. This will make my task that much easier. \u201cRalf Kenning is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cWho commands here?\u201d\nThe drinkers stared at him blankly. One laughed. Another spat. Finally one of the Codds said, \u201cWho asks?\u201d\n\u201cLord Balon\u2019s son.\u201d Reek, my name is Reek, it rhymes with cheek. \u201cI am here at the command of Ramsay Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood and heir to the Dreadfort, who captured me at Winterfell. His host is north of you, his father\u2019s to the south, but Lord Ramsay is prepared to be merciful if you yield Moat Cailin to him before the sun goes down.\u201d He drew out the letter that they\u2019d given him and tossed it on the table before the drinkers.\nOne of them picked it up and turned it over in his hands, picking at the pink wax that sealed it. After a moment he said, \u201cParchment. What good is that? It\u2019s cheese we need, and meat.\u201d\n\u201cSteel, you mean,\u201d said the man beside him, a greybeard whose left arm ended in a stump. \u201cSwords. Axes. Aye, and bows, a hundred more bows, and men to loose the arrows.\u201d\n\u201cIronborn do not surrender,\u201d said a third voice.\n\u201cTell that to my father. Lord Balon bent the knee when Robert broke his wall. Elsewise he would have died. As you will if you do not yield.\u201d He gestured at the parchment. \u201cBreak the seal. Read the words. That is a safe conduct, written in Lord Ramsay\u2019s own hand. Give up your swords and come with me, and his lordship will feed you and give you leave to march unmolested to the Stony Shore and find a ship for home. Elsewise you die.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d One of the Codds pushed to his feet. A big man, but pop-eyed and wide of mouth, with dead white flesh. He looked as if his father had sired him on a fish, but he still wore a longsword. \u201cDagon Codd yields to no man.\u201d\nNo, please, you have to listen. The thought of what Ramsay would do to him if he crept back to camp without the garrison\u2019s surrender was almost enough to make him piss his breeches. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with leak. \u201cIs that your answer?\u201d The words rang feebly in his ears. \u201cDoes this codfish speak for all of you?\u201d\nThe guard who had met him at the door seemed less certain. \u201cVictarion commanded us to hold, he did. I heard him with my own ears. Hold here till I return, he told Kenning.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said the one-armed man. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. The kingsmoot called, but he swore that he\u2019d be back, with a driftwood crown upon his head and a thousand men behind him.\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle is never coming back,\u201d Reek told them. \u201cThe kingswood crowned his brother Euron, and the Crow\u2019s Eye has other wars to fight. You think my uncle values you? He doesn\u2019t. You are the ones he left behind to die. He scraped you off the same way he scrapes mud off his boots when he wades ashore.\u201d\nThose words struck home. He could see it in their eyes, in the way they looked at one another or frowned above their cups. They all feared they\u2019d been abandoned, but it took me to turn fear into certainty. These were not the kin of famous captains nor the blood of the great Houses of the Iron Islands. These were the sons of thralls and salt wives.\n\u201cIf we yield, we walk away?\u201d said the one-armed man. \u201cIs that what it says on this here writing?\u201d He nudged the roll of parchment, its wax seal still unbroken.\n\u201cRead it for yourself,\u201d he answered, though he was almost certain that none of them could read. \u201cLord Ramsay treats his captives honorably so long as they keep faith with him.\u201d He has only taken toes and fingers and that other thing, when he might have had my tongue, or peeled the skin off my legs from heel to thigh. \u201cYield up your swords to him, and you will live.\u201d\n\u201cLiar.\u201d Dagon Codd drew his longsword. \u201cYou\u2019re the one they call Turncloak. Why should we believe your promises?\u201d\nHe is drunk, Reek realized. The ale is speaking. \u201cBelieve what you want. I have brought Lord Ramsay\u2019s message. Now I must return to him. We\u2019ll sup on wild boar and neeps, washed down with strong red wine. Those who come with me will be welcome at the feast. The rest of you will die within a day. The Lord of the Dreadfort will bring his knights up the causeway, whilst his son leads his own men down on you from the north. No quarter will be granted. The ones that die fighting will be the lucky ones. Those who live will be given to the bog devils.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d snarled Dagon Codd. \u201cYou think you can frighten ironborn with words? Begone. Run back to your master before I open your belly, pull your entrails out, and make you eat them.\u201d\nHe might have said more, but suddenly his eyes gaped wide. A throwing axe sprouted from the center of his forehead with a solid thunk. Codd\u2019s sword fell from his fingers. He jerked like a fish on a hook, then crashed face-first onto the table.\nIt was the one-armed man who\u2019d flung the axe. As he rose to his feet he had another in his hand. \u201cWho else wants to die?\u201d he asked the other drinkers. \u201cSpeak up, I\u2019ll see you do.\u201d Thin red streams were spreading out across the stone from the pool of blood where Dagon Codd\u2019s head had come to rest. \u201cMe, I mean to live, and that don\u2019t mean staying here to rot.\u201d\nOne man took a swallow of ale. Another turned his cup over to wash away a finger of blood before it reached the place where he was seated. No one spoke. When the one-armed man slid the throwing axe back through his belt, Reek knew he had won. He almost felt a man again. Lord Ramsay will be pleased with me.\nHe pulled down the kraken banner with his own two hands, fumbling some because of his missing fingers but thankful for the fingers that Lord Ramsay had allowed him to keep. It took the better part of the afternoon before the ironborn were ready to depart. There were more of them than he would have guessed\u2014forty-seven in the Gatehouse Tower and another eighteen in the Drunkard\u2019s Tower. Two of those were so close to dead there was no hope for them, another five too weak to walk. That still left fifty-eight who were fit enough to fight. Weak as they were, they would have taken three times their own number with them if Lord Ramsay had stormed the ruins. He did well to send me, Reek told himself as he climbed back onto his stot to lead his ragged column back across the boggy ground to where the northmen were encamped. \u201cLeave your weapons here,\u201d he told the prisoners. \u201cSwords, bows, daggers. Armed men will be slain on sight.\u201d\nIt took them thrice as long to cover the distance as it had taken Reek alone. Crude litters had been patched together for four of the men who could not walk; the fifth was carried by his son, upon his back. It made for slow going, and all the ironborn were well aware of how exposed they were, well within bowshot of the bog devils and their poisoned arrows. If I die, I die. Reek only prayed the archer knew his business, so death would be quick and clean. A man\u2019s death, not the end Ralf Kenning suffered.\nThe one-armed man walked at the head of the procession, limping heavily. His name, he said, was Adrack Humble, and he had a rock wife and three salt wives back on Great Wyk. \u201cThree of the four had big bellies when we sailed,\u201d he boasted, \u201cand Humbles run to twins. First thing I\u2019ll need to do when I get back is count up my new sons. Might be I\u2019ll even name one after you, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nAye, name him Reek, he thought, and when he\u2019s bad you can cut his toes off and give him rats to eat. He turned his head and spat, and wondered if Ralf Kenning hadn\u2019t been the lucky one.\nA light rain had begun to piss down out of the slate-grey sky by the time Lord Ramsay\u2019s camp appeared in front of them. A sentry watched them pass in silence. The air was full of drifting smoke from the cookfires drowning in the rain. A column of riders came wheeling up behind them, led by a lordling with a horsehead on his shield. One of Lord Ryswell\u2019s sons, Reek knew. Roger, or maybe Rickard. He could not tell the two of them apart. \u201cIs this all of them?\u201d the rider asked from atop a chestnut stallion.\n\u201cAll who weren\u2019t dead, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI thought there would be more. We came at them three times, and three times they threw us back.\u201d\nWe are ironborn, he thought, with a sudden flash of pride, and for half a heartbeat he was a prince again, Lord Balon\u2019s son, the blood of Pyke. Even thinking was dangerous, though. He had to remember his name. Reek, my name is Reek, it rhymes with weak.\nThey were just outside the camp when the baying of a pack of hounds told of Lord Ramsay\u2019s approach. Whoresbane was with him, along with half a dozen of his favorites, Skinner and Sour Alyn and Damon Dance-for-Me, and the Walders Big and Little too. The dogs swarmed around them, snapping and snarling at the strangers. The Bastard\u2019s girls, Reek thought, before he remembered that one must never, never, never use that word in Ramsay\u2019s presence.\nReek swung down from his saddle and took a knee. \u201cMy lord, Moat Cailin is yours. Here are its last defenders.\u201d\n\u201cSo few. I had hoped for more. They were such stubborn foes.\u201d Lord Ramsay\u2019s pale eyes shone. \u201cYou must be starved. Damon, Alyn, see to them. Wine and ale, and all the food that they can eat. Skinner, show their wounded to our maesters.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d\nA few of the ironborn muttered thanks before they shambled off toward the cookfires in the center of the camp. One of the Codds even tried to kiss Lord Ramsay\u2019s ring, but the hounds drove him back before he could get close, and Alison took a chunk of his ear. Even as the blood streamed down his neck, the man bobbed and bowed and praised his lordship\u2019s mercy.\nWhen the last of them were gone, Ramsay Bolton turned his smile on Reek. He clasped him by the back of the head, pulled his face close, kissed him on his cheek, and whispered, \u201cMy old friend Reek. Did they really take you for their prince? What bloody fools, these ironmen. The gods are laughing.\u201d\n\u201cAll they want is to go home, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you want, my sweet Reek?\u201d Ramsay murmured, as softly as a lover. His breath smelled of mulled wine and cloves, so sweet. \u201cSuch valiant service deserves a reward. I cannot give you back your fingers or your toes, but surely there is something you would have of me. Shall I free you instead? Release you from my service? Do you want to go with them, return to your bleak isles in the cold grey sea, be a prince again? Or would you sooner stay my leal serving man?\u201d\nA cold knife scraped along his spine. Be careful, he told himself, be very, very careful. He did not like his lordship\u2019s smile, the way his eyes were shining, the spittle glistening at the corner of his mouth. He had seen such signs before. You are no prince. You\u2019re Reek, just Reek, it rhymes with freak. Give him the answer that he wants.\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, \u201cmy place is here, with you. I\u2019m your Reek. I only want to serve you. All I ask\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a skin of wine, that would be reward enough for me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0red wine, the strongest that you have, all the wine a man can drink\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nLord Ramsay laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a man, Reek. You\u2019re just my creature. You\u2019ll have your wine, though. Walder, see to it. And fear not, I won\u2019t return you to the dungeons, you have my word as a Bolton. We\u2019ll make a dog of you instead. Meat every day, and I\u2019ll even leave you teeth enough to eat it. You can sleep beside my girls. Ben, do you have a collar for him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have one made, m\u2019lord,\u201d said old Ben Bones.\nThe old man did better than that. That night, besides the collar, there was a ragged blanket too, and half a chicken. Reek had to fight the dogs for the meat, but it was the best meal he\u2019d had since Winterfell.\nAnd the wine\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the wine was dark and sour, but strong. Squatting amongst the hounds, Reek drank until his head swam, retched, wiped his mouth, and drank some more. Afterward he lay back and closed his eyes. When he woke a dog was licking vomit from his beard, and dark clouds were scuttling across the face of a sickle moon. Somewhere in the night, men were screaming. He shoved the dog aside, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\nThe next morning Lord Ramsay dispatched three riders down the causeway to take word to his lord father that the way was clear. The flayed man of House Bolton was hoisted above the Gatehouse Tower, where Reek had hauled down the golden kraken of Pyke. Along the rotting-plank road, wooden stakes were driven deep into the boggy ground; there the corpses festered, red and dripping. Sixty-three, he knew, there are sixty-three of them. One was short half an arm. Another had a parchment shoved between its teeth, its wax seal still unbroken.\nThree days later, the vanguard of Roose Bolton\u2019s host threaded its way through the ruins and past the row of grisly sentinels\u2014four hundred mounted Freys clad in blue and grey, their spearpoints glittering whenever the sun broke through the clouds. Two of old Lord Walder\u2019s sons led the van. One was brawny, with a massive jut of jaw and arms thick with muscle. The other had hungry eyes close-set above a pointed nose, a thin brown beard that did not quite conceal the weak chin beneath it, a bald head. Hosteen and Aenys. He remembered them from before he knew his name. Hosteen was a bull, slow to anger but implacable once roused, and by repute the fiercest fighter of Lord Walder\u2019s get. Aenys was older, crueler, and more clever\u2014a commander, not a swordsman. Both were seasoned soldiers.\nThe northmen followed hard behind the van, their tattered banners streaming in the wind. Reek watched them pass. Most were afoot, and there were so few of them. He remembered the great host that marched south with Young Wolf, beneath the direwolf of Winterfell. Twenty thousand swords and spears had gone off to war with Robb, or near enough to make no matter, but only two in ten were coming back, and most of those were Dreadfort men.\nBack where the press was thickest at the center of the column rode a man armored in dark grey plate over a quilted tunic of blood-red leather. His rondels were wrought in the shape of human heads, with open mouths that shrieked in agony. From his shoulders streamed a pink woolen cloak embroidered with droplets of blood. Long streamers of red silk fluttered from the top of his closed helm. No crannogman will slay Roose Bolton with a poisoned arrow, Reek thought when he first saw him. An enclosed wagon groaned along behind him, drawn by six heavy draft horses and defended by crossbowmen, front and rear. Curtains of dark blue velvet concealed the wagon\u2019s occupants from watching eyes.\nFarther back came the baggage train\u2014lumbering wayns laden with provisions and loot taken in the war, and carts crowded with wounded men and cripples. And at the rear, more Freys. At least a thousand, maybe more: bowmen, spearmen, peasants armed with scythes and sharpened sticks, freeriders and mounted archers, and another hundred knights to stiffen them.\nCollared and chained and back in rags again, Reek followed with the other dogs at Lord Ramsay\u2019s heels when his lordship strode forth to greet his father. When the rider in the dark armor removed his helm, however, the face beneath was not one that Reek knew. Ramsay\u2019s smile curdled at the sight, and anger flashed across his face. \u201cWhat is this, some mockery?\u201d\n\u201cJust caution,\u201d whispered Roose Bolton, as he emerged from behind the curtains of the enclosed wagon.\nThe Lord of the Dreadfort did not have a strong likeness to his bastard son. His face was clean-shaved, smooth-skinned, ordinary, not handsome but not quite plain. Though Roose had been in battles, he bore no scars. Though well past forty, he was as yet unwrinkled, with scarce a line to tell of the passage of time. His lips were so thin that when he pressed them together they seemed to vanish altogether. There was an agelessness about him, a stillness; on Roose Bolton\u2019s face, rage and joy looked much the same. All he and Ramsay had in common were their eyes. His eyes are ice. Reek wondered if Roose Bolton ever cried. If so, do the tears feel cold upon his cheeks?\nOnce, a boy called Theon Greyjoy had enjoyed tweaking Bolton as they sat at council with Robb Stark, mocking his soft voice and making japes about leeches. He must have been mad. This is no man to jape with. You had only to look at Bolton to know that he had more cruelty in his pinky toe than all the Freys combined.\n\u201cFather.\u201d Lord Ramsay knelt before his sire.\nLord Roose studied him for a moment. \u201cYou may rise.\u201d He turned to help two young women down from inside the wagon.\nThe first was short and very fat, with a round red face and three chins wobbling beneath a sable hood. \u201cMy new wife,\u201d Roose Bolton said. \u201cLady Walda, this is my natural son. Kiss your stepmother\u2019s hand, Ramsay.\u201d He did. \u201cAnd I am sure you will recall the Lady Arya. Your betrothed.\u201d\nThe girl was slim, and taller than he remembered, but that was only to be expected. Girls grow fast at that age. Her dress was grey wool bordered with white satin; over it she wore an ermine cloak clasped with a silver wolf\u2019s head. Dark brown hair fell halfway down her back. And her eyes\u00a0\u2026\nThat is not Lord Eddard\u2019s daughter.\nArya had her father\u2019s eyes, the grey eyes of the Starks. A girl her age might let her hair grow long, add inches to her height, see her chest fill out, but she could not change the color of her eyes. That\u2019s Sansa\u2019s little friend, the steward\u2019s girl. Jeyne, that was her name. Jeyne Poole.\n\u201cLord Ramsay.\u201d The girl dipped down before him. That was wrong as well. The real Arya Stark would have spat into his face. \u201cI pray that I will make you a good wife and give you strong sons to follow after you.\u201d\n\u201cThat you will,\u201d promised Ramsay, \u201cand soon.\u201d",

      "content": "JON\nHis candle had guttered out in a pool of wax, but morning light was shining through the shutters of his window. Jon had fallen asleep over his work again. Books covered his table, tall stacks of them. He\u2019d fetched them up himself, after spending half the night searching through dusty vaults by lantern light. Sam was right, the books desperately needed to be sorted, listed, and put in order, but that was no task for stewards who could neither read nor write. It would need to wait for Sam\u2019s return.\nIf he does return. Jon feared for Sam and Maester Aemon. Cotter Pyke had written from Eastwatch to report that the Storm Crow had sighted the wreckage of a galley along the coast of Skagos. Whether the broken ship was Blackbird, one of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s sellsails, or some passing trader, the crew of the Storm Crow had not been able to discern. I meant to send Gilly and the babe to safety. Did I send them to their graves instead?\nLast night\u2019s supper had congealed beside his elbow, scarce touched. Dolorous Edd had filled his trencher almost to overflowing to allow Three-Finger Hobb\u2019s infamous three-meat stew to soften the stale bread. The jest among the brothers was that the three meats were mutton, mutton, and mutton, but carrot, onion, and turnip would have been closer to the mark. A film of cold grease glistened atop the remains of the stew.\nBowen Marsh had urged him to move into the Old Bear\u2019s former chambers in the King\u2019s Tower after Stannis vacated them, but Jon had declined. Moving into the king\u2019s chambers could too easily be taken to mean he did not expect the king to return.\nA strange listlessness had settled over Castle Black since Stannis had marched south, as if the free folk and the black brothers alike were holding their breath, waiting to see what would come. The yards and dining hall were empty more oft than not, the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower was a shell, the old common hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin\u2019s Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over. The only sound of life that Jon could hear was the faint clash of swords coming from the yard outside the armory. Iron Emmett was shouting at Hop-Robin to keep his shield up. We had all best keep our shields up.\nJon washed and dressed and left the armory, stopping in the yard outside just long enough to say a few words of encouragement to Hop-Robin and Emmett\u2019s other charges. He declined Ty\u2019s offer of a tail, as usual. He would have men enough about him; if it came to blood, two more would hardly matter. He did take Longclaw, though, and Ghost followed at his heels.\nBy the time he reached the stable, Dolorous Edd had the lord commander\u2019s palfrey saddled and bridled and waiting for him. The wayns were forming up beneath Bowen Marsh\u2019s watchful eye. The Lord Steward was trotting down the column, pointing and fussing, his cheeks red from the cold. When he spied Jon, they reddened even more. \u201cLord Commander. Are you still intent on this\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0folly?\u201d finished Jon. \u201cPlease tell me you were not about to say folly, my lord. Yes, I am. We have been over this. Eastwatch wants more men. The Shadow Tower wants more men. Greyguard and Icemark as well, I have no doubt, and we have fourteen other castles still sitting empty, long leagues of Wall that remain unwatched and undefended.\u201d\nMarsh pursed his lips. \u201cLord Commander Mormont\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is dead. And not at wildling hands, but at the hands of his own Sworn Brothers, men he trusted. Neither you nor I can know what he would or would not have done in my place.\u201d Jon wheeled his horse around. \u201cEnough talk. Away.\u201d\nDolorous Edd had heard the entire exchange. As Bowen Marsh trotted off, he nodded toward his back and said, \u201cPomegranates. All those seeds. A man could choke to death. I\u2019d sooner have a turnip. Never knew a turnip to do a man any harm.\u201d\nIt was at times like this that Jon missed Maester Aemon the most. Clydas tended to the ravens well enough, but he had not a tenth of Aemon Targaryen\u2019s knowledge or experience, and even less of his wisdom. Bowen was a good man in his way, but the wound he had taken at the Bridge of Skulls had hardened his attitudes, and the only song he ever sang now was his familiar refrain about sealing the gates. Othell Yarwyck was as stolid and unimaginative as he was taciturn, and the First Rangers seemed to die as quick as they were named. The Night\u2019s Watch has lost too many of its best men, Jon reflected, as the wagons began to move. The Old Bear, Qhorin Halfhand, Donal Noye, Jarmen Buckwell, my uncle\u00a0\u2026\nA light snow began to fall as the column made its way south along the kingsroad, the long line of wagons wending past fields and streams and wooded hillsides, with a dozen spearmen and a dozen archers riding escort. The last few trips had seen some ugliness at Mole\u2019s Town, a little pushing and shoving, some muttered curses, a lot of sullen looks. Bowen Marsh felt it best not to take chances, and for once he and Jon were agreed.\nThe Lord Steward led the way. Jon rode a few yards back, Dolorous Edd Tollett at his side. Half a mile south of Castle Black, Edd urged his garron close to Jon\u2019s and said, \u201cM\u2019lord? Look up there. The big drunkard on the hill.\u201d\nThe drunkard was an ash tree, twisted sideways by centuries of wind. And now it had a face. A solemn mouth, a broken branch for a nose, two eyes carved deep into the trunk, gazing north up the kingsroad, toward the castle and the Wall.\nThe wildlings brought their gods with them after all. Jon was not surprised. Men do not give up their gods so easily. The whole pageant that Lady Melisandre had orchestrated beyond the Wall suddenly seemed as empty as a mummer\u2019s farce. \u201cLooks a bit like you, Edd,\u201d he said, trying to make light of it.\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord. I don\u2019t have leaves growing out my nose, but elsewise\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Lady Melisandre won\u2019t be happy.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not like to see it. See that no one tells her.\u201d\n\u201cShe sees things in those fires, though.\u201d\n\u201cSmoke and cinders.\u201d\n\u201cAnd people burning. Me, most like. With leaves up my nose. I always feared I\u2019d burn, but I was hoping to die first.\u201d\nJon glanced back at the face, wondering who had carved it. He had posted guards around Mole\u2019s Town, both to keep his crows away from the wildling women and to keep the free folk from slipping off southward to raid. Whoever had carved up the ash had eluded his sentries, plainly. And if one man could slip through the cordon, others could as well. I could double the guard again, he thought sourly. Waste twice as many men, men who might otherwise be walking the Wall.\nThe wagons continued on their slow way south through frozen mud and blowing snow. A mile farther on, they came upon a second face, carved into a chestnut tree that grew beside an icy stream, where its eyes could watch the old plank bridge that spanned its flow. \u201cTwice as much trouble,\u201d announced Dolorous Edd.\nThe chestnut was leafless and skeletal, but its bare brown limbs were not empty. On a low branch overhanging the stream a raven sat hunched, its feathers ruffled up against the cold. When it spied Jon it spread its wings and gave a scream. When he raised his fist and whistled, the big black bird came flapping down, crying, \u201cCorn, corn, corn.\u201d\n\u201cCorn for the free folk,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cNone for you.\u201d He wondered if they would all be reduced to eating ravens before the coming winter had run its course.\nThe brothers on the wagons had seen this face as well, Jon did not doubt. No one spoke of it, but the message was plain to read for any man with eyes. Jon had once heard Mance Rayder say that most kneelers were sheep. \u201cNow, a dog can herd a flock of sheep,\u201d the King-Beyond-the-Wall had said, \u201cbut free folk, well, some are shadowcats and some are stones. One kind prowls where they please and will tear your dogs to pieces. The other will not move at all unless you kick them.\u201d Neither shadowcats nor stones were like to give up the gods they had worshiped all their lives to bow down before one they hardly knew.\nJust north of Mole\u2019s Town they came upon the third watcher, carved into the huge oak that marked the village perimeter, its deep eyes fixed upon the kingsroad. That is not a friendly face, Jon Snow reflected. The faces that the First Men and the children of the forest had carved into the weirwoods in eons past had stern or savage visages more oft than not, but the great oak looked especially angry, as if it were about to tear its roots from the earth and come roaring after them. Its wounds are as fresh as the wounds of the men who carved it.\nMole\u2019s Town had always been larger than it seemed; most of it was underground, sheltered from the cold and snow. That was more true than ever now. The Magnar of Thenn had put the empty village to the torch when he passed through on his way to attack Castle Black, and only heaps of blackened beams and old scorched stones remained above-ground\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but down beneath the frozen earth, the vaults and tunnels and deep cellars still endured, and that was where the free folk had taken refuge, huddled together in the dark like the moles from which the village took its name.\nThe wagons drew up in a crescent in front of what had once been the village smithy. Nearby a swarm of red-faced children were building a snow fort, but they scattered at the sight of the black-cloaked brothers, vanishing down one hole or another. A few moments later the adults began to emerge from the earth. A stench came with them, the smell of unwashed bodies and soiled clothing, of nightsoil and urine. Jon saw one of his men wrinkle his nose and say something to the man beside him. Some jape about the smell of freedom, he guessed. Too many of his brothers were making japes about the stench of the savages in Mole\u2019s Town.\nPig ignorance, Jon thought. The free folk were no different than the men of the Night\u2019s Watch; some were clean, some dirty, but most were clean at times and dirty at other times. This stink was just the smell of a thousand people jammed into cellars and tunnels that had been dug to shelter no more than a hundred.\nThe wildlings had done this dance before. Wordless, they formed up in lines behind the wagons. There were three women for every man, many with children\u2014pale skinny things clutching at their skirts. Jon saw very few babes in arms. The babes in arms died during the march, he realized, and those who survived the battle died in the king\u2019s stockade.\nThe fighters had fared better. Three hundred men of fighting age, Justin Massey had claimed in council. Lord Harwood Fell had counted them. There will be spearwives too. Fifty, sixty, maybe as many as a hundred. Fell\u2019s count had included men who had suffered wounds, Jon knew. He saw a score of those\u2014men on crude crutches, men with empty sleeves and missing hands, men with one eye or half a face, a legless man carried between two friends. And every one grey-faced and gaunt. Broken men, he thought. The wights are not the only sort of living dead.\nNot all the fighting men were broken, though. Half a dozen Thenns in bronze scale armor stood clustered round one cellar stair, watching sullenly and making no attempt to join the others. In the ruins of the old village smithy Jon spied a big bald slab of a man he recognized as Halleck, the brother of Harma Dogshead. Harma\u2019s pigs were gone, though. Eaten, no doubt. Those two in furs were Hornfoot men, as savage as they were scrawny, barefoot even in the snow. There are wolves amongst these sheep, still.\nVal had reminded him of that, on his last visit with her. \u201cFree folk and kneelers are more alike than not, Jon Snow. Men are men and women women, no matter which side of the Wall we were born on. Good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we have plenty, as do you.\u201d\nShe was not wrong. The trick was telling one from the other, parting the sheep from the goats.\nThe black brothers began to pass out food. They\u2019d brought slabs of hard salt beef, dried cod, dried beans, turnips, carrots, sacks of barley meal and wheaten flour, pickled eggs, barrels of onions and apples. \u201cYou can have an onion or an apple,\u201d Jon heard Hairy Hal tell one woman, \u201cbut not both. You got to pick.\u201d\nThe woman did not seem to understand. \u201cI need two of each. One o\u2019 each for me, t\u2019others for my boy. He\u2019s sick, but an apple will set him right.\u201d\nHal shook his head. \u201cHe has to come get his own apple. Or his onion. Not both. Same as you. Now, is it an apple or an onion? Be quick about it, now, there\u2019s more behind you.\u201d\n\u201cAn apple,\u201d she said, and he gave her one, an old dried thing, small and withered.\n\u201cMove along, woman,\u201d shouted a man three places back. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here.\u201d\nThe woman paid the shout no mind. \u201cAnother apple,\u201d she said to Hairy Hal. \u201cFor my son. Please. This one is so little.\u201d\nHal looked to Jon. Jon shook his head. They would be out of apples soon enough. If they started giving two to everyone who wanted two, the latecomers would get none.\n\u201cOut of the way,\u201d a girl behind the woman said. Then she shoved her in the back. The woman staggered, lost her apple, and fell. The other foodstuffs in her arms went flying. Beans scattered, a turnip rolled into a mud puddle, a sack of flour split and spilled its precious contents in the snow.\nAngry voices rose, in the Old Tongue and the Common. More shoving broke out at another wagon. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d an old man snarled. \u201cYou bloody crows are starving us to death.\u201d The woman who\u2019d been knocked down was scrabbling on her knees after her food. Jon saw the flash of naked steel a few yards away. His own bowmen nocked arrows to their strings.\nHe turned in his saddle. \u201cRory. Quiet them.\u201d\nRory lifted his great horn to his lips and blew.\nAA\u200bAA\u200bho\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo.\nThe tumult and the shoving died. Heads turned. A child began to cry. Mormont\u2019s raven walked from Jon\u2019s left shoulder to his right, bobbing its head and muttering, \u201cSnow, snow, snow.\u201d\nJon waited until the last echoes had faded, then spurred his palfrey forward where everyone could see him. \u201cWe\u2019re feeding you as best we can, as much as we can spare. Apples, onions, neeps, carrots\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there\u2019s a long winter ahead for all of us, and our stores are not inexhaustible.\u201d\n\u201cYou crows eat good enough.\u201d Halleck shoved forward.\nFor now. \u201cWe hold the Wall. The Wall protects the realm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and you now. You know the foe we face. You know what\u2019s coming down on us. Some of you have faced them before. Wights and white walkers, dead things with blue eyes and black hands. I\u2019ve seen them too, fought them, sent one to hell. They kill, then they send your dead against you. The giants were not able to stand against them, nor you Thenns, the ice-river clans, the Hornfoots, the free folk\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and as the days grow shorter and the nights colder, they are growing stronger. You left your homes and came south in your hundreds and your thousands\u00a0\u2026\u00a0why, but to escape them? To be safe. Well, it\u2019s the Wall that keeps you safe. It\u2019s us that keeps you safe, the black crows you despise.\u201d\n\u201cSafe and starved,\u201d said a squat woman with a windburned face, a spearwife by the look of her.\n\u201cYou want more food?\u201d asked Jon. \u201cThe food\u2019s for fighters. Help us hold the Wall, and you\u2019ll eat as well as any crow.\u201d Or as poorly, when the food runs short.\nA silence fell. The wildlings exchanged wary looks. \u201cEat,\u201d the raven muttered. \u201cCorn, corn.\u201d\n\u201cFight for you?\u201d This voice was thickly accented. Sigorn, the young Magnar of Thenn, spoke the Common Tongue haltingly at best. \u201cNot fight for you. Kill you better. Kill all you.\u201d\nThe raven flapped its wings. \u201cKill, kill.\u201d\nSigorn\u2019s father, the old Magnar, had been crushed beneath the falling stair during his attack on Castle Black. I would feel the same if someone asked me to make common cause with the Lannisters, Jon told himself. \u201cYour father tried to kill us all,\u201d he reminded Sigorn. \u201cThe Magnar was a brave man, yet he failed. And if he had succeeded\u00a0\u2026\u00a0who would hold the Wall?\u201d He turned away from the Thenns. \u201cWinterfell\u2019s walls were strong as well, but Winterfell stands in ruins today, burned and broken. A wall is only as good as the men defending it.\u201d\nAn old man with a turnip cradled against his chest said, \u201cYou kill us, you starve us, now you want t\u2019 make us slaves.\u201d\nA chunky red-faced man shouted assent. \u201cI\u2019d sooner go naked than wear one o\u2019 them black rags on my back.\u201d\nOne of the spearwives laughed. \u201cEven your wife don\u2019t want to see you naked, Butts.\u201d\nA dozen voices all began to speak at once. The Thenns were shouting in the Old Tongue. A little boy began to cry. Jon Snow waited until all of it had died down, then turned to Hairy Hal and said, \u201cHal, what was it that you told this woman?\u201d\nHal looked confused. \u201cAbout the food, you mean? An apple or an onion? That\u2019s all I said. They got to pick.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to pick,\u201d Jon Snow repeated. \u201cAll of you. No one is asking you to take our vows, and I do not care what gods you worship. My own gods are the old gods, the gods of the North, but you can keep the red god, or the Seven, or any other god who hears your prayers. It\u2019s spears we need. Bows. Eyes along the Wall.\n\u201cI will take any boy above the age of twelve who knows how to hold a spear or string a bow. I will take your old men, your wounded, and your cripples, even those who can no longer fight. There are other tasks they may be able to perform. Fletching arrows, milking goats, gathering firewood, mucking out our stables\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the work is endless. And yes, I will take your women too. I have no need of blushing maidens looking to be protected, but I will take as many spearwives as will come.\u201d\n\u201cAnd girls?\u201d a girl asked. She looked as young as Arya had, the last time Jon had seen her.\n\u201cSixteen and older.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking boys as young as twelve.\u201d\nDown in the Seven Kingdoms boys of twelve were often pages or squires; many had been training at arms for years. Girls of twelve were children. These are wildlings, though. \u201cAs you will. Boys and girls as young as twelve. But only those who know how to obey an order. That goes for all of you. I will never ask you to kneel to me, but I will set captains over you, and serjeants who will tell you when to rise and when to sleep, where to eat, when to drink, what to wear, when to draw your swords and loose your arrows. The men of the Night\u2019s Watch serve for life. I will not ask that of you, but so long as you are on the Wall you will be under my command. Disobey an order, and I\u2019ll have your head off. Ask my brothers if I won\u2019t. They\u2019ve seen me do it.\u201d\n\u201cOff,\u201d screamed the Old Bear\u2019s raven. \u201cOff, off, off.\u201d\n\u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d Jon Snow told them. \u201cThose who want to help us hold the Wall, return to Castle Black with me and I\u2019ll see you armed and fed. The rest of you, get your turnips and your onions and crawl back inside your holes.\u201d\nThe girl was the first to come forward. \u201cI can fight. My mother was a spearwife.\u201d Jon nodded. She may not even be twelve, he thought, as she squirmed between a pair of old men, but he was not about to turn away his only recruit.\nA pair of striplings followed her, boys no older than fourteen. Next a scarred man with a missing eye. \u201cI seen them too, the dead ones. Even crows are better\u2019n that.\u201d A tall spearwife, an old man on crutches, a moonfaced boy with a withered arm, a young man whose red hair reminded Jon of Ygritte.\nAnd then Halleck. \u201cI don\u2019t like you, crow,\u201d he growled, \u201cbut I never liked the Mance neither, no more\u2019n my sister did. Still, we fought for him. Why not fight for you?\u201d\nThe dam broke then. Halleck was a man of note. Mance was not wrong. \u201cFree folk don\u2019t follow names, or little cloth animals sewn on a tunic,\u201d the King-Beyond-the-Wall had told him. \u201cThey won\u2019t dance for coins, they don\u2019t care how you style yourself or what that chain of office means or who your grandsire was. They follow strength. They follow the man.\u201d\nHalleck\u2019s cousins followed Halleck, then one of Harma\u2019s banner-bearers, then men who\u2019d fought with her, then others who had heard tales of their prowess. Greybeards and green boys, fighting men in their prime, wounded men and cripples, a good score of spearwives, even three Hornfoot men.\nBut no Thenns. The Magnar turned and vanished back into the tunnels, and his bronze-clad minions followed hard at his heels.\nBy the time the last withered apple had been handed out, the wagons were crowded with wildlings, and they were sixty-three stronger than when the column had set out from Castle Black that morning. \u201cWhat will you do with them?\u201d Bowen Marsh asked Jon on the ride back up the kingsroad.\n\u201cTrain them, arm then, and split them up. Send them where they\u2019re needed. Eastwatch, the Shadow Tower, Icemark, Greyguard. I mean to open three more forts as well.\u201d\nThe Lord Steward glanced back. \u201cWomen too? Our brothers are not accustomed to having women amongst them, my lord. Their vows\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there will be fights, rapes\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThese women have knives and know how to use them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the first time one of these spearwives slits the throat of one of our brothers, what then?\u201d\n\u201cWe will have lost a man,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut we have just gained sixty-three. You\u2019re good at counting, my lord. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but my reckoning leaves us sixty-two ahead.\u201d\nMarsh was unconvinced. \u201cYou\u2019ve added sixty-three more mouths, my lord\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but how many are fighters, and whose side will they fight on? If it\u2019s the Others at the gates, most like they\u2019ll stand with us, I grant you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if it\u2019s Tormund Giantsbane or the Weeping Man come calling with ten thousand howling killers, what then?\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll know. So let us hope it never comes to that.\u201d",

      "content": "TYRION\nHe dreamt of his lord father and the Shrouded Lord. He dreamt that they were one and the same, and when his father wrapped stone arms around him and bent to give him his grey kiss, he woke with his mouth dry and rusty with the taste of blood and his heart hammering in his chest.\n\u201cOur dead dwarf has returned to us,\u201d Haldon said.\nTyrion shook his head to clear away the webs of dream. The Sorrows. I was lost in the Sorrows. \u201cI am not dead.\u201d\n\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d The Halfmaester stood over him. \u201cDuck, be a fine fowl and boil some broth for our little friend here. He must be famished.\u201d\nHe was on the Shy Maid, Tyrion saw, under a scratchy blanket that smelled of vinegar. The Sorrows are behind us. It was just a dream I dreamed as I was drowning. \u201cWhy do I stink of vinegar?\u201d\n\u201cLemore has been washing you with it. Some say it helps prevent the greyscale. I am inclined to doubt that, but there was no harm in trying. It was Lemore who forced the water from your lungs after Griff had pulled you up. You were as cold as ice, and your lips were blue. Yandry said we ought to throw you back, but the lad forbade it.\u201d\nThe prince. Memory came rushing back: the stone man reaching out with cracked grey hands, the blood seeping from his knuckles. He was heavy as a boulder, pulling me under. \u201cGriff brought me up?\u201d He must hate me, or he would have let me die. \u201cHow long have I been sleeping? What place is this?\u201d\n\u201cSelhorys.\u201d Haldon produced a small knife from his sleeve. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, tossing it underhand at Tyrion.\nThe dwarf flinched. The knife landed between his feet and stood quivering in the deck. He plucked it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cTake off your boots. Prick each of your toes and fingers.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds\u00a0\u2026\u00a0painful.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so. Do it.\u201d\nTyrion yanked off one boot and then the other, peeled down his hose, squinted at his toes. It seemed to him they looked no better or worse than usual. He poked gingerly at one big toe.\n\u201cHarder,\u201d urged Haldon Halfmaester.\n\u201cDo you want me to draw blood?\u201d\n\u201cIf need be.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a scab on every toe.\u201d\n\u201cThe purpose of the exercise is not to count your toes. I want to see you wince. So long as the pricks hurt, you are safe. It is only when you cannot feel the blade that you will have cause to fear.\u201d\nGreyscale. Tyrion grimaced. He stabbed another toe, cursed as a bead of blood welled up around the knife\u2019s point. \u201cThat hurt. Are you happy?\u201d\n\u201cDancing with joy.\u201d\n\u201cYour feet smell worse than mine, Yollo.\u201d Duck had a cup of broth. \u201cGriff warned you not to lay hands upon the stone men.\u201d\n\u201cAye, but he forgot to warn the stone men not to lay their hands upon me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you prick, look for patches of dead grey skin, for nails beginning to turn black,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cIf you see such signs, do not hesitate. Better to lose a toe than a foot. Better to lose an arm than spend your days wailing on the Bridge of Dream. Now the other foot, if you please. Then your fingers.\u201d\nThe dwarf recrossed his stunted legs and began to prick the other set of toes. \u201cShall I prick my prick as well?\u201d\n\u201cIt would not hurt.\u201d\n\u201cIt would not hurt you is what you mean. Though I had as well slice it off for all the use I make of it.\u201d\n\u201cFeel free. We will have it tanned and stuffed and sell it for a fortune. A dwarf\u2019s cock has magical powers.\u201d\n\u201cI have been telling all the women that for years.\u201d Tyrion drove the dagger\u2019s point into the ball of his thumb, watched the blood bead up, sucked it away. \u201cHow long must I continue to torture myself? When will we be certain that I\u2019m clean?\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d said the Halfmaester. \u201cNever. You swallowed half the river. You may be going grey even now, turning to stone from inside out, starting with your heart and lungs. If so, pricking your toes and bathing in vinegar will not save you. When you\u2019re done, come have some broth.\u201d\nThe broth was good, though Tyrion noted that the Halfmaester kept the table between them as he ate. The Shy Maid was moored to a weathered pier on the east bank of the Rhoyne. Two piers down, a Volantene river galley was discharging soldiers. Shops and stalls and storehouses huddled beneath a sandstone wall. The towers and domes of the city were visible beyond it, reddened by the light of the setting sun.\nNo, not a city. Selhorys was still accounted a mere town, and was ruled from Old Volantis. This was not Westeros.\nLemore emerged on deck with the prince in tow. When she saw Tyrion, she rushed across the deck to hug him. \u201cThe Mother is merciful. We have prayed for you, Hugor.\u201d\nYou did, at least. \u201cI won\u2019t hold that against you.\u201d\nYoung Griff\u2019s greeting was less effusive. The princeling was in a sullen mood, angry that he had been forced to remain on the Shy Maid instead of going ashore with Yandry and Ysilla. \u201cWe only want to keep you safe,\u201d Lemore told him. \u201cThese are unsettled times.\u201d\nHaldon Halfmaester explained. \u201cOn the way down from the Sorrows to Selhorys, we thrice glimpsed riders moving south along the river\u2019s eastern shore. Dothraki. Once they were so close we could hear the bells tinkling in their braids, and sometimes at night their fires could be seen beyond the eastern hills. We passed warships as well, Volantene river galleys crammed with slave soldiers. The triarchs fear an attack upon Selhorys, plainly.\u201d\nTyrion understood that quick enough. Alone amongst the major river towns, Selhorys stood upon the eastern bank of the Rhoyne, making it much more vulnerable to the horselords than its sister towns across the river. Even so, it is a small prize. If I were khal, I would feint at Selhorys, let the Volantenes rush to defend it, then swing south and ride hard for Volantis itself.\n\u201cI know how to use a sword,\u201d Young Griff was insisting.\n\u201cEven the bravest of your forebears kept his Kingsguard close about him in times of peril.\u201d Lemore had changed out of her septa\u2019s robes into garb more befitting the wife or daughter of a prosperous merchant. Tyrion watched her closely. He had sniffed out the truth beneath the dyed blue hair of Griff and Young Griff easily enough, and Yandry and Ysilla seemed to be no more than they claimed to be, whilst Duck was somewhat less. Lemore, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Who is she, really? Why is she here? Not for gold, I\u2019d judge. What is this prince to her? Was she ever a true septa?\nHaldon took note of her change of garb as well. \u201cWhat are we to make of this sudden loss of faith? I preferred you in your septa\u2019s robes, Lemore.\u201d\n\u201cI preferred her naked,\u201d said Tyrion.\nLemore gave him a reproachful look. \u201cThat is because you have a wicked soul. Septa\u2019s robes scream of Westeros and might draw unwelcome eyes onto us.\u201d She turned back to Prince Aegon. \u201cYou are not the only one who must needs hide.\u201d\nThe lad did not seem appeased. The perfect prince but still half a boy for all that, with little and less experience of the world and all its woes. \u201cPrince Aegon,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201csince we\u2019re both stuck aboard this boat, perhaps you will honor me with a game of cyvasse to while away the hours?\u201d\nThe prince gave him a wary look. \u201cI am sick of cyvasse.\u201d\n\u201cSick of losing to a dwarf, you mean?\u201d\nThat pricked the lad\u2019s pride, just as Tyrion had known it would. \u201cGo fetch the board and pieces. This time I mean to smash you.\u201d\nThey played on deck, sitting cross-legged behind the cabin. Young Griff arrayed his army for attack, with dragon, elephants, and heavy horse up front. A young man\u2019s formation, as bold as it is foolish. He risks all for the quick kill. He let the prince have first move. Haldon stood behind them, watching the play.\nWhen the prince reached for his dragon, Tyrion cleared his throat. \u201cI would not do that if I were you. It is a mistake to bring your dragon out too soon.\u201d He smiled innocently. \u201cYour father knew the dangers of being overbold.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know my true father?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I saw him twice or thrice, but I was only ten when Robert killed him, and mine own sire had me hidden underneath a rock. No, I cannot claim I knew Prince Rhaegar. Not as your false father did. Lord Connington was the prince\u2019s dearest friend, was he not?\u201d\nYoung Griff pushed a lock of blue hair out of his eyes. \u201cThey were squires together at King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\n\u201cA true friend, our Lord Connington. He must be, to remain so fiercely loyal to the grandson of the king who took his lands and titles and sent him into exile. A pity about that. Elsewise Prince Rhaegar\u2019s friend might have been on hand when my father sacked King\u2019s Landing, to save Prince Rhaegar\u2019s precious little son from getting his royal brains dashed out against a wall.\u201d\nThe lad flushed. \u201cThat was not me. I told you. That was some tanner\u2019s son from Pisswater Bend whose mother died birthing him. His father sold him to Lord Varys for a jug of Arbor gold. He had other sons but had never tasted Arbor gold. Varys gave the Pisswater boy to my lady mother and carried me away.\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d Tyrion moved his elephants. \u201cAnd when the pisswater prince was safely dead, the eunuch smuggled you across the narrow sea to his fat friend the cheesemonger, who hid you on a poleboat and found an exile lord willing to call himself your father. It does make for a splendid story, and the singers will make much of your escape once you take the Iron Throne\u00a0\u2026\u00a0assuming that our fair Daenerys takes you for her consort.\u201d\n\u201cShe will. She must.\u201d\n\u201cMust?\u201d Tyrion made a tsking sound. \u201cThat is not a word queens like to hear. You are her perfect prince, agreed, bright and bold and comely as any maid could wish. Daenerys Targaryen is no maid, however. She is the widow of a Dothraki khal, a mother of dragons and sacker of cities, Aegon the Conqueror with teats. She may not prove as willing as you wish.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be willing.\u201d Prince Aegon sounded shocked. It was plain that he had never before considered the possibility that his bride-to-be might refuse him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d He picked up his heavy horse and put it down with a thump.\nThe dwarf shrugged. \u201cI know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, \u2018Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I\u2019ve been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I\u2019ve washed the blue dye from my hair and I\u2019d like a dragon, please\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nAegon\u2019s mouth twisted in fury. \u201cI will not come to my aunt a beggar. I will come to her a kinsman, with an army.\u201d\n\u201cA small army.\u201d There, that\u2019s made him good and angry. The dwarf could not help but think of Joffrey. I have a gift for angering princes. \u201cQueen Daenerys has a large one, and no thanks to you.\u201d Tyrion moved his crossbows.\n\u201cSay what you want. She will be my bride, Lord Connington will see to it. I trust him as much as if he were my own blood.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you should be the fool instead of me. Trust no one, my prince. Not your chainless maester, not your false father, not the gallant Duck nor the lovely Lemore nor these other fine friends who grew you from a bean. Above all, trust not the cheesemonger, nor the Spider, nor this little dragon queen you mean to marry. All that mistrust will sour your stomach and keep you awake by night, \u2019tis true, but better that than the long sleep that does not end.\u201d The dwarf pushed his black dragon across a range of mountains. \u201cBut what do I know? Your false father is a great lord, and I am just some twisted little monkey man. Still, I\u2019d do things differently.\u201d\nThat got the boy\u2019s attention. \u201cHow differently?\u201d\n\u201cIf I were you? I would go west instead of east. Land in Dorne and raise my banners. The Seven Kingdoms will never be more ripe for conquest than they are right now. A boy king sits the Iron Throne. The north is in chaos, the riverlands a devastation, a rebel holds Storm\u2019s End and Dragonstone. When winter comes, the realm will starve. And who remains to deal with all of this, who rules the little king who rules the Seven Kingdoms? Why, my own sweet sister. There is no one else. My brother, Jaime, thirsts for battle, not for power. He\u2019s run from every chance he\u2019s had to rule. My uncle Kevan would make a passably good regent if someone pressed the duty on him, but he will never reach for it. The gods shaped him to be a follower, not a leader.\u201d Well, the gods and my lord father. \u201cMace Tyrell would grasp the sceptre gladly, but mine own kin are not like to step aside and give it to him. And everyone hates Stannis. Who does that leave? Why, only Cersei.\n\u201cWesteros is torn and bleeding, and I do not doubt that even now my sweet sister is binding up the wounds\u00a0\u2026\u00a0with salt. Cersei is as gentle as King Maegor, as selfless as Aegon the Unworthy, as wise as Mad Aerys. She never forgets a slight, real or imagined. She takes caution for cowardice and dissent for defiance. And she is greedy. Greedy for power, for honor, for love. Tommen\u2019s rule is bolstered by all of the alliances that my lord father built so carefully, but soon enough she will destroy them, every one. Land and raise your banners, and men will flock to your cause. Lords great and small, and smallfolk too. But do not wait too long, my prince. The moment will not last. The tide that lifts you now will soon recede. Be certain you reach Westeros before my sister falls and someone more competent takes her place.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Prince Aegon said, \u201cwithout Daenerys and her dragons, how could we hope to win?\u201d\n\u201cYou do not need to win,\u201d Tyrion told him. \u201cAll you need to do is raise your banners, rally your supporters, and hold, until Daenerys arrives to join her strength to yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou said she might not have me.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I overstated. She may take pity on you when you come begging for her hand.\u201d The dwarf shrugged. \u201cDo you want to wager your throne upon a woman\u2019s whim? Go to Westeros, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ah, then you are a rebel, not a beggar. Bold, reckless, a true scion of House Targaryen, walking in the footsteps of Aegon the Conqueror. A dragon.\n\u201cI told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar\u2019s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and she will fly to your side as fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this Breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother\u2019s son in his hour of peril. And when she reaches Westeros, and meets you for the first time, you will meet as equals, man and woman, not queen and supplicant. How can she help but love you then, I ask you?\u201d Smiling, he seized his dragon, flew it across the board. \u201cI hope Your Grace will pardon me. Your king is trapped. Death in four.\u201d\nThe prince stared at the playing board. \u201cMy dragon\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is too far away to save you. You should have moved her to the center of the battle.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI lied. Trust no one. And keep your dragon close.\u201d\nYoung Griff jerked to his feet and kicked over the board. Cyvasse pieces flew in all directions, bouncing and rolling across the deck of the Shy Maid. \u201cPick those up,\u201d the boy commanded.\nHe may well be a Targaryen after all. \u201cIf it please Your Grace.\u201d Tyrion got down on his hands and knees and began to crawl about the deck, gathering up pieces.\nIt was close to dusk when Yandry and Ysilla returned to the Shy Maid. A porter trotted at their heels, pushing a wheelbarrow heaped high with provisions: salt and flour, fresh-churned butter, slabs of bacon wrapped in linen, sacks of oranges, apples, and pears. Yandry had a wine cask on one shoulder, while Ysilla had slung a pike over hers. The fish was as large as Tyrion.\nWhen she saw the dwarf standing at the end of the gangplank, Ysilla stopped so suddenly that Yandry blundered into her, and the pike almost slid off her back into the river. Duck helped her rescue it. Ysilla glared at Tyrion and made a peculiar stabbing gesture with three of her fingers. A sign to ward off evil. \u201cLet me help you with that fish,\u201d he said to Duck.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ysilla snapped. \u201cStay away. Touch no food besides the food you eat yourself.\u201d\nThe dwarf raised both hands. \u201cAs you command.\u201d\nYandry thumped the wine cask down onto the desk. \u201cWhere\u2019s Griff?\u201d he demanded of Haldon.\n\u201cAsleep.\u201d\n\u201cThen rouse him. We have tidings he\u2019d best hear. The queen\u2019s name is on every tongue in Selhorys. They say she still sits in Meereen, sore beset. If the talk in the markets can be believed, Old Volantis will soon join the war against her.\u201d\nHaldon pursed his lips. \u201cThe gossip of fishmongers is not to be relied on. Still, I suppose Griff will want to hear. You know how he is.\u201d The Halfmaester went below.\nThe girl never started for the west. No doubt she had good reasons. Between Meereen and Volantis lay five hundred leagues of deserts, mountains, swamps, and ruins, plus Mantarys with its sinister repute. A city of monsters, they say, but if she marches overland, where else is she to turn for food and water? The sea would be swifter, but if she does not have the ships\u00a0\u2026\nBy the time Griff appeared on deck, the pike was spitting and sizzling over the brazier whilst Ysilla hovered over it with a lemon, squeezing. The sellsword wore his mail and wolfskin cloak, soft leather gloves, dark woolen breeches. If he was surprised to see Tyrion awake, he gave no sign beyond his customary scowl. He took Yandry back to the tiller, where they spoke in low voices, too quietly for the dwarf to hear.\nFinally Griff beckoned to Haldon. \u201cWe need to know the truth of these rumors. Go ashore and learn what you can. Qavo will know, if you can find him. Try the Riverman and the Painted Turtle. You know his other places.\u201d\n\u201cAye. I\u2019ll take the dwarf as well. Four ears hear more than two. And you know how Qavo is about his cyvasse.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish. Be back before the sun comes up. If for any reason you\u2019re delayed, make your way to the Golden Company.\u201d\nSpoken like a lord. Tyrion kept the thought to himself.\nHaldon donned a hooded cloak, and Tyrion shed his homemade motley for something drab and grey. Griff allowed them each a purse of silver from Illyrio\u2019s chests. \u201cTo loosen tongues.\u201d\nDusk was giving way to darkness as they made their way along the riverfront. Some of the ships they passed appeared deserted, their gangplanks drawn up. Others crawled with armed men who eyed them with suspicion. Under the town walls, parchment lanterns had been lit above the stalls, throwing pools of colored light upon the cobbled path. Tyrion watched as Haldon\u2019s face turned green, then red, then purple. Under the cacophony of foreign tongues, he heard queer music playing from somewhere up ahead, a thin high fluting accompanied by drums. A dog was barking too, behind them.\nAnd the whores were out. River or sea, a port was a port, and wherever you found sailors, you\u2019d find whores. Is that what my father meant? Is that where whores go, to the sea?\nThe whores of Lannisport and King\u2019s Landing were free women. Their sisters of Selhorys were slaves, their bondage indicated by the tears tattooed beneath their right eyes. Old as sin and twice as ugly, the lot of them. It was almost enough to put a man off whoring. Tyrion felt their eyes upon them as he waddled by, and heard them whispering to one another and giggling behind their hands. You would think they had never seen a dwarf before.\nA squad of Volantene spearmen stood guard at the river gate. Torchlight gleamed off the steel claws that jutted from their gauntlets. Their helms were tiger\u2019s masks, the faces beneath marked by green stripes tattooed across both cheeks. The slave soldiers of Volantis were fiercely proud of their tiger stripes, Tyrion knew. Do they yearn for freedom? he wondered. What would they do if this child queen bestowed it on them? What are they, if not tigers? What am I, if not a lion?\nOne of the tigers spied the dwarf and said something that made the others laugh. As they reached the gate, he pulled off his clawed gauntlet and the sweaty glove beneath, locked one arm around the dwarf\u2019s neck, and roughly rubbed his head. Tyrion was too startled to resist. It was all over in a heartbeat. \u201cWas there some reason for that?\u201d he demanded of the Halfmaester.\n\u201cHe says that it is good luck to rub the head of a dwarf,\u201d Haldon said after an exchange with the guard in his own tongue.\nTyrion forced himself to smile at the man. \u201cTell him that it is even better luck to suck on a dwarf\u2019s cock.\u201d\n\u201cBest not. Tigers have been known to have sharp teeth.\u201d\nA different guard motioned them through the gate, waving a torch at them impatiently. Haldon Halfmaester led the way into Selhorys proper, with Tyrion waddling warily at his heels.\nA great square opened up before them. Even at this hour, it was crowded and noisy and ablaze with light. Lanterns swung from iron chains above the doors of inns and pleasure houses, but within the gates, they were made of colored glass, not parchment. To their right a nightfire burned outside a temple of red stone. A priest in scarlet robes stood on the temple balcony, haranguing the small crowd that had gathered around the flames. Elsewhere, travelers sat playing cyvasse in front of an inn, drunken soldiers wandered in and out of what was obviously a brothel, a woman beat a mule outside a stable. A two-wheeled cart went rumbling past them, pulled by a white dwarf elephant. This is another world, thought Tyrion, but not so different from the world I know.\nThe square was dominated by a white marble statue of a headless man in impossibly ornate armor, astride a warhorse similarly arrayed. \u201cWho might that be?\u201d wondered Tyrion.\n\u201cTriarch Horonno. A Volantene hero from the Century of Blood. He was returned as triarch every year for forty years, until he wearied of elections and declared himself triarch for life. The Volantenes were not amused. He was put to death soon after. Tied between two elephants and torn in half.\u201d\n\u201cHis statue seems to lack a head.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a tiger. When the elephants came to power, their followers went on a rampage, knocking the heads from the statues of those they blamed for all the wars and deaths.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat was another age. Come, we\u2019d best hear what that priest is going on about. I swear I heard the name Daenerys.\u201d\nAcross the square they joined the growing throng outside the red temple. With the locals towering above him on every hand, the little man found it hard to see much beyond their arses. He could hear most every word the priest was saying, but that was not to say he understood them. \u201cDo you understand what he is saying?\u201d he asked Haldon in the Common Tongue.\n\u201cI would if I did not have a dwarf piping in my ear.\u201d\n\u201cI do not pipe.\u201d Tyrion crossed his arms and looked behind him, studying the faces of the men and women who had stopped to listen. Everywhere he turned, he saw tattoos. Slaves. Four of every five of them are slaves.\n\u201cThe priest is calling on the Volantenes to go to war,\u201d the Halfmaester told him, \u201cbut on the side of right, as soldiers of the Lord of Light, R\u2019hllor who made the sun and stars and fights eternally against the darkness. Nyessos and Malaquo have turned away from the light, he says, their hearts darkened by the yellow harpies from the east. He says\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDragons. I understood that word. He said dragons.\u201d\n\u201cAye. The dragons have come to carry her to glory.\u201d\n\u201cHer. Daenerys?\u201d\nHaldon nodded. \u201cBenerro has sent forth the word from Volantis. Her coming is the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. From smoke and salt was she born to make the world anew. She is Azor Ahai returned\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and her triumph over darkness will bring a summer that will never end\u00a0\u2026\u00a0death itself will bend its knee, and all those who die fighting in her cause shall be reborn\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo I have to be reborn in this same body?\u201d asked Tyrion. The crowd was growing thicker. He could feel them pressing in around them. \u201cWho is Benerro?\u201d\nHaldon raised an eyebrow. \u201cHigh Priest of the red temple in Volantis. Flame of Truth, Light of Wisdom, First Servant of the Lord of Light, Slave of R\u2019hllor.\u201d\nThe only red priest Tyrion had ever known was Thoros of Myr, the portly, genial, wine-stained roisterer who had loitered about Robert\u2019s court swilling the king\u2019s finest vintages and setting his sword on fire for m\u00eal\u00e9es. \u201cGive me priests who are fat and corrupt and cynical,\u201d he told Haldon, \u201cthe sort who like to sit on soft satin cushions, nibble sweetmeats, and diddle little boys. It\u2019s the ones who believe in gods who make the trouble.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be that we can use this trouble to our advantage. I know where we may find answers.\u201d Haldon led them past the headless hero to where a big stone inn fronted on the square. The ridged shell of some immense turtle hung above its door, painted in garish colors. Inside a hundred dim red candles burned like distant stars. The air was fragrant with the smell of roasted meat and spices, and a slave girl with a turtle on one cheek was pouring pale green wine.\nHaldon paused in the doorway. \u201cThere. Those two.\u201d\nIn the alcove two men sat over a carved stone cyvasse table, squinting at their pieces by the light of a red candle. One was gaunt and sallow, with thinning black hair and a blade of a nose. The other was wide of shoulder and round of belly, with corkscrew ringlets tumbling past his collar. Neither deigned to look up from their game until Haldon drew up a chair between them and said, \u201cMy dwarf plays better cyvasse than both of you combined.\u201d\nThe bigger man raised his eyes to gaze at the intruders in distaste and said something in the tongue of Old Volantis, too fast for Tyrion to hope to follow. The thinner one leaned back in his chair. \u201cIs he for sale?\u201d he asked in the Common Tongue of Westeros. \u201cThe triarch\u2019s grotesquerie is in need of a cyvasse-playing dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cYollo is no slave.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d The thin man shifted an onyx elephant.\nAcross the cyvasse table, the man behind the alabaster army pursed his lips in disapproval. He moved his heavy horse.\n\u201cA blunder,\u201d said Tyrion. He had as well play his part.\n\u201cJust so,\u201d the thin man said. He answered with his own heavy horse. A flurry of quick moves followed, until finally the thin man smiled and said, \u201cDeath, my friend.\u201d\nThe big man glowered at the board, then rose and growled something in his own tongue. His opponent laughed. \u201cCome now. The dwarf does not stink as bad as that.\u201d He beckoned Tyrion toward the empty chair. \u201cUp with you, little man. Put your silver on the table, and we will see how well you play the game.\u201d\nWhich game? Tyrion might have asked. He climbed onto the chair. \u201cI play better with a full belly and a cup of wine to hand.\u201d The thin man turned obligingly and called for the slave girl to fetch them food and drink.\nHaldon said, \u201cThe noble Qavo Nogarys is the customs officer here in Selhorys. I have never once defeated him at cyvasse.\u201d\nTyrion understood. \u201cPerhaps I will be more fortunate.\u201d He opened his purse and stacked silver coins beside the board, one atop another until finally Qavo smiled.\nAs each of them was setting up his pieces behind the cyvasse screen, Haldon said, \u201cWhat news from downriver? Will it be war?\u201d\nQavo shrugged. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i would have it so. They style themselves the Wise Masters. Of their wisdom I cannot speak, but they do not lack for cunning. Their envoy came to us with chests of gold and gems and two hundred slaves, nubile girls and smooth-skinned boys trained in the way of the seven sighs. I am told his feasts are memorable and his bribes lavish.\u201d\n\u201cThe Yunkishmen have bought your triarchs?\u201d\n\u201cOnly Nyessos.\u201d Qavo removed the screen and studied the placement of Tyrion\u2019s army. \u201cMalaquo may be old and toothless, but he is a tiger still, and Doniphos will not be returned as triarch. The city thirsts for war.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d wondered Tyrion. \u201cMeereen is long leagues across the sea. How has this sweet child queen offended Old Volantis?\u201d\n\u201cSweet?\u201d Qavo laughed. \u201cIf even half the stories coming back from Slaver\u2019s Bay are true, this child is a monster. They say that she is bloodthirsty, that those who speak against her are impaled on spikes to die lingering deaths. They say she is a sorceress who feeds her dragons on the flesh of newborn babes, an oathbreaker who mocks the gods, breaks truces, threatens envoys, and turns on those who have served her loyally. They say her lust cannot be sated, that she mates with men, women, eunuchs, even dogs and children, and woe betide the lover who fails to satisfy her. She gives her body to men to take their souls in thrall.\u201d\nOh, good, thought Tyrion. If she gives her body to me, she is welcome to my soul, small and stunted though it is.\n\u201cThey say,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cBy they, you mean the slavers, the exiles she drove from Astapor and Meereen. Mere calumnies.\u201d\n\u201cThe best calumnies are spiced with truth,\u201d suggested Qavo, \u201cbut the girl\u2019s true sin cannot be denied. This arrogant child has taken it upon herself to smash the slave trade, but that traffic was never confined to Slaver\u2019s Bay. It was part of the sea of trade that spanned the world, and the dragon queen has clouded the water. Behind the Black Wall, lords of ancient blood sleep poorly, listening as their kitchen slaves sharpen their long knives. Slaves grow our food, clean our streets, teach our young. They guard our walls, row our galleys, fight our battles. And now when they look east, they see this young queen shining from afar, this breaker of chains. The Old Blood cannot suffer that. Poor men hate her too. Even the vilest beggar stands higher than a slave. This dragon queen would rob him of that consolation.\u201d\nTyrion advanced his spearmen. Qavo replied with his light horse. Tyrion moved his crossbowmen up a square and said, \u201cThe red priest outside seemed to think Volantis should fight for this silver queen, not against her.\u201d\n\u201cThe red priests would be wise to hold their tongues,\u201d said Qavo Nogarys. \u201cAlready there has been fighting between their followers and those who worship other gods. Benerro\u2019s rantings will only serve to bring a savage wrath down upon his head.\u201d\n\u201cWhat rantings?\u201d the dwarf asked, toying with his rabble.\nThe Volantene waved a hand. \u201cIn Volantis, thousands of slaves and freedmen crowd the temple plaza every night to hear Benerro shriek of bleeding stars and a sword of fire that will cleanse the world. He has been preaching that Volantis will surely burn if the triarchs take up arms against the silver queen.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a prophecy even I could make. Ah, supper.\u201d\nSupper was a plate of roasted goat served on a bed of sliced onions. The meat was spiced and fragrant, charred outside and red and juicy within. Tyrion plucked at a piece. It was so hot it burned his fingers, but so good he could not help but reach for another chunk. He washed it down with the pale green Volantene liquor, the closest thing he\u2019d had to wine for ages. \u201cVery good,\u201d he said, plucking up his dragon. \u201cThe most powerful piece in the game,\u201d he announced, as he removed one of Qavo\u2019s elephants. \u201cAnd Daenerys Targaryen has three, it\u2019s said.\u201d\n\u201cThree,\u201d Qavo allowed, \u201cagainst thrice three thousand enemies. Grazdan mo Eraz was not the only envoy sent out from the Yellow City. When the Wise Masters move against Meereen, the legions of New Ghis will fight beside them. Tolosi. Elyrians. Even the Dothraki.\u201d\n\u201cYou have Dothraki outside your own gates,\u201d Haldon said.\n\u201cKhal Pono.\u201d Qavo waved a pale hand in dismissal. \u201cThe horselords come, we give them gifts, the horselords go.\u201d He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion\u2019s alabaster dragon, removed it from the board.\nThe rest was slaughter, though the dwarf held on another dozen moves. \u201cThe time has come for bitter tears,\u201d Qavo said at last, scooping up the pile of silver. \u201cAnother game?\u201d\n\u201cNo need,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cMy dwarf has had his lesson in humility. I think it is best we get back to our boat.\u201d\nOutside in the square, the nightfire was still burning, but the priest was gone and the crowd was long dispersed. The glow of candles glimmered from the windows of the brothel. From inside came the sound of women\u2019s laughter. \u201cThe night is still young,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cQavo may not have told us everything. And whores hear much and more from the men they service.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need a woman so badly, Yollo?\u201d\n\u201cA man grows weary of having no lovers but his fingers.\u201d Selhorys may be where whores go. Tysha might be in there even now, with tears tattooed upon her cheek. \u201cI almost drowned. A man needs a woman after that. Besides, I need to make sure my prick hasn\u2019t turned to stone.\u201d\nThe Halfmaester laughed. \u201cI will wait for you in the tavern by the gate. Do not be too long about your business.\u201d\n\u201cOh, have no fear on that count. Most women prefer to be done with me as quickly as they can.\u201d\nThe brothel was a modest one compared to those the dwarf had been wont to frequent in Lannisport and King\u2019s Landing. The proprietor did not seem to speak any tongue but that of Volantis, but he understood the clank of silver well enough and led Tyrion through an archway into a long room that smelled of incense, where four bored slave girls were lounging about in various states of undress. Two had seen at least forty namedays come and go, he guessed; the youngest was perhaps fifteen or sixteen. None was as hideous as the whores he\u2019d seen working the docks, though they fell well short of beauty. One was plainly pregnant. Another was just fat, and sported iron rings in both her nipples. All four had tears tattooed beneath one eye.\n\u201cDo you have a girl who speaks the tongue of Westeros?\u201d asked Tyrion. The proprietor squinted, uncomprehending, so he repeated the question in High Valyrian. This time the man seemed to grasp a word or three and replied in Volantene. \u201cSunset girl\u201d was all the dwarf could get out of his answer. He took that to mean a girl from the Sunset Kingdoms.\nThere was only one such in the house, and she was not Tysha. She had freckled cheeks and tight red curls upon her head, which gave promise of freckled breasts and red hair between her legs. \u201cShe\u2019ll do,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cand I\u2019ll have a flagon too. Red wine with red flesh.\u201d The whore was looking at his noseless face with revulsion in her eyes. \u201cDo I offend you, sweetling? I am an offensive creature, as my father would be glad to tell you if he were not dead and rotting.\u201d\nThough she did look Westerosi, the girl spoke not a word of the Common Tongue. Perhaps she was captured by some slaver as a child. Her bedchamber was small, but there was a Myrish carpet on the floor and a mattress stuffed with feathers in place of straw. I have seen worse. \u201cWill you give me your name?\u201d he asked, as he took a cup of wine from her. \u201cNo?\u201d The wine was strong and sour and required no translation. \u201cI suppose I shall settle for your cunt.\u201d He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cHave you ever bedded a monster before? Now\u2019s as good a time as any. Out of your clothes and onto your back, if it please you. Or not.\u201d\nShe looked at him uncomprehending, until he took the flagon from her hands and lifted her skirts up over her head. After that she understood what was required of her, though she did not prove the liveliest of partners. Tyrion had been so long without a woman that he spent himself inside her on the third thrust.\nHe rolled off feeling more ashamed than sated. This was a mistake. What a wretched creature I\u2019ve become. \u201cDo you know a woman by the name of Tysha?\u201d he asked, as he watched his seed dribble out of her onto the bed. The whore did not respond. \u201cDo you know where whores go?\u201d She did not answer that one either. Her back was crisscrossed by ridges of scar tissue. This girl is as good as dead. I have just fucked a corpse. Even her eyes looked dead. She does not even have the strength to loathe me.\nHe needed wine. A lot of wine. He seized the flagon with both hands and raised it to his lips. The wine ran red. Down his throat, down his chin. It dripped from his beard and soaked the feather bed. In the candlelight it looked as dark as the wine that had poisoned Joffrey. When he was done he tossed the empty flagon aside and half-rolled and half-staggered to the floor, groping for a chamber pot. There was none to be found. His stomach heaved, and he found himself on his knees, retching on the carpet, that wonderful thick Myrish carpet, as comforting as lies.\nThe whore cried out in distress. They will blame her for this, he realized, ashamed. \u201cCut off my head and take it to King\u2019s Landing,\u201d Tyrion urged her. \u201cMy sister will make a lady of you, and no one will ever whip you again.\u201d She did not understand that either, so he shoved her legs apart, crawled between them, and took her once more. That much she could comprehend, at least.\nAfterward the wine was done and so was he, so he wadded up the girl\u2019s clothing and tossed it at the door. She took the hint and fled, leaving him alone in the darkness, sinking deeper into his feather bed. I am stinking drunk. He dare not close his eyes, for fear of sleep. Beyond the veil of dream, the Sorrows were waiting for him. Stone steps ascending endlessly, steep and slick and treacherous, and somewhere at the top, the Shrouded Lord. I do not want to meet the Shrouded Lord. Tyrion fumbled back into his clothes again and groped his way to the stair. Griff will flay me. Well, why not? If ever a dwarf deserved a skinning, I\u2019m him.\nHalfway down the steps, he lost his footing. Somehow he managed to break his tumble with his hands and turn it into a clumsy thumping cartwheel. The whores in the room below looked up in astonishment when he landed at the foot of the steps. Tyrion rolled onto his feet and gave them a bow. \u201cI am more agile when I\u2019m drunk.\u201d He turned to the proprietor. \u201cI fear I ruined your carpet. The girl\u2019s not to blame. Let me pay.\u201d He pulled out a fistful of coins and tossed them at the man.\n\u201cImp,\u201d a deep voice said, behind him.\nIn the corner of the room, a man sat in a pool of shadow, with a whore squirming on his lap. I never saw that girl. If I had, I would have taken her upstairs instead of freckles. She was younger than the others, slim and pretty, with long silvery hair. Lyseni, at a guess\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the man whose lap she filled was from the Seven Kingdoms. Burly and broad-shouldered, forty if he was a day, and maybe older. Half his head was bald, but coarse stubble covered his cheeks and chin, and hair grew thickly down his arms, sprouting even from his knuckles.\nTyrion did not like the look of him. He liked the big black bear on his surcoat even less. Wool. He\u2019s wearing wool, in this heat. Who else but a knight would be so fucking mad? \u201cHow pleasant to hear the Common Tongue so far from home,\u201d he made himself say, \u201cbut I fear you have mistaken me. My name is Hugor Hill. May I buy you a cup of wine, my friend?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve drunk enough.\u201d The knight shoved his whore aside and got to his feet. His sword belt hung on a peg beside him. He took it down and drew his blade. Steel whispered against leather. The whores were watching avidly, candlelight shining in their eyes. The proprietor had vanished. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Hugor.\u201d\nTyrion could no more outrun him than outfight him. Drunk as he was, he could not even hope to outwit him. He spread his hands. \u201cAnd what do you mean to do with me?\u201d\n\u201cDeliver you,\u201d the knight said, \u201cto the queen.\u201d",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nGalazza Galare arrived at the Great Pyramid attended by a dozen White Graces, girls of noble birth who were still too young to have served their year in the temple\u2019s pleasure gardens. They made for a pretty portrait, the proud old woman all in green surrounded by the little girls robed and veiled in white, armored in their innocence.\nThe queen welcomed them warmly, then summoned Missandei to see that the girls were fed and entertained whilst she shared a private supper with the Green Grace.\nHer cooks had prepared them a magnificent meal of honeyed lamb, fragrant with crushed mint and served with the small green figs she liked so much. Two of Dany\u2019s favorite hostages served the food and kept the cups filled\u2014a doe-eyed little girl called Qezza and a skinny boy named Grazhar. They were brother and sister, and cousins of the Green Grace, who greeted them with kisses when she swept in, and asked them if they had been good.\n\u201cThey are very sweet, the both of them,\u201d Dany assured her. \u201cQezza sings for me sometimes. She has a lovely voice. And Ser Barristan has been instructing Grazhar and the other boys in the ways of western chivalry.\u201d\n\u201cThey are of my blood,\u201d the Green Grace said, as Qezza filled her cup with a dark red wine. \u201cIt is good to know they have pleased Your Radiance. I hope I may do likewise.\u201d The old woman\u2019s hair was white and her skin was parchment thin, but the years had not dimmed her eyes. They were as green as her robes; sad eyes, full of wisdom. \u201cIf you will forgive my saying so, Your Radiance looks\u00a0\u2026\u00a0weary. Are you sleeping?\u201d\nIt was all Dany could do not to laugh. \u201cNot well. Last night three Qartheen galleys sailed up the Skahazadhan under the cover of darkness. The Mother\u2019s Men loosed flights of fire arrows at their sails and flung pots of burning pitch onto their decks, but the galleys slipped by quickly and suffered no lasting harm. The Qartheen mean to close the river to us, as they have closed the bay. And they are no longer alone. Three galleys from New Ghis have joined them, and a carrack out of Tolos.\u201d The Tolosi had replied to her request for an alliance by proclaiming her a whore and demanding that she return Meereen to its Great Masters. Even that was preferable to the answer of Mantarys, which came by way of caravan in a cedar chest. Inside she had found the heads of her three envoys, pickled. \u201cPerhaps your gods can help us. Ask them to send a gale and sweep the galleys from the bay.\u201d\n\u201cI shall pray and make sacrifice. Mayhaps the gods of Ghis will hear me.\u201d Galazza Galare sipped her wine, but her eyes did not leave Dany. \u201cStorms rage within the walls as well as without. More freedmen died last night, or so I have been told.\u201d\n\u201cThree.\u201d Saying it left a bitter taste in her mouth. \u201cThe cowards broke in on some weavers, freedwomen who had done no harm to anyone. All they did was make beautiful things. I have a tapestry they gave me hanging over my bed. The Sons of the Harpy broke their loom and raped them before slitting their throats.\u201d\n\u201cThis we have heard. And yet Your Radiance has found the courage to answer butchery with mercy. You have not harmed any of the noble children you hold as hostage.\u201d\n\u201cNot as yet, no.\u201d Dany had grown fond of her young charges. Some were shy and some were bold, some sweet and some sullen, but all were innocent. \u201cIf I kill my cupbearers, who will pour my wine and serve my supper?\u201d she said, trying to make light of it.\nThe priestess did not smile. \u201cThe Shavepate would feed them to your dragons, it is said. A life for a life. For every Brazen Beast cut down, he would have a child die.\u201d\nDany pushed her food about her plate. She dare not glance over to where Grazhar and Qezza stood, for fear that she might cry. The Shavepate has a harder heart than mine. They had fought about the hostages half a dozen times. \u201cThe Sons of the Harpy are laughing in their pyramids,\u201d Skahaz said, just this morning. \u201cWhat good are hostages if you will not take their heads?\u201d In his eyes, she was only a weak woman. Hazzea was enough. What good is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children? \u201cThese murders are not their doing,\u201d Dany told the Green Grace, feebly. \u201cI am no butcher queen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for that Meereen gives thanks,\u201d said Galazza Galare. \u201cWe have heard that the Butcher King of Astapor is dead.\u201d\n\u201cSlain by his own soldiers when he commanded them to march out and attack the Yunkai\u2019i.\u201d The words were bitter in her mouth. \u201cHe was hardly cold before another took his place, calling himself Cleon the Second. That one lasted eight days before his throat was opened. Then his killer claimed the crown. So did the first Cleon\u2019s concubine. King Cutthroat and Queen Whore, the Astapori call them. Their followers are fighting battles in the streets, while the Yunkai\u2019i and their sellswords wait outside the walls.\u201d\n\u201cThese are grievous times. Your Radiance, might I presume to offer you my counsel?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how much I value your wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cThen heed me now and marry.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Dany had been expecting this.\n\u201cOftimes I have heard you say that you are only a young girl. To look at you, you still seem half a child, too young and frail to face such trials by yourself. You need a king beside you to help you bear these burdens.\u201d\nDany speared a chunk of lamb, took a bite from it, chewed slowly. \u201cTell me, can this king puff his cheeks up and blow Xaro\u2019s galleys back to Qarth? Can he clap his hands and break the siege of Astapor? Can he put food in the bellies of my children and bring peace back to my streets?\u201d\n\u201cCan you?\u201d the Green Grace asked. \u201cA king is not a god, but there is still much that a strong man might do. When my people look at you, they see a conqueror from across the seas, come to murder us and make slaves of our children. A king could change that. A highborn king of pure Ghiscari blood could reconcile the city to your rule. Elsewise, I fear, your reign must end as it began, in blood and fire.\u201d\nDany pushed her food about her plate. \u201cAnd who would the gods of Ghis have me take as my king and consort?\u201d\n\u201cHizdahr zo Loraq,\u201d Galazza Galare said firmly.\nDany did not trouble to feign surprise. \u201cWhy Hizdahr? Skahaz is noble born as well.\u201d\n\u201cSkahaz is Kandaq, Hizdahr Loraq. Your Radiance will forgive me, but only one who is not herself Ghiscari would not understand the difference. Oft have I heard that yours is the blood of Aegon the Conqueror, Jaehaerys the Wise, and Daeron the Dragon. The noble Hizdahr is of the blood of Mazdhan the Magnificent, Hazrak the Handsome, and Zharaq the Liberator.\u201d\n\u201cHis forebears are as dead as mine. Will Hizdahr raise their shades to defend Meereen against its enemies? I need a man with ships and swords. You offer me ancestors.\u201d\n\u201cWe are an old people. Ancestors are important to us. Wed Hizdahr zo Loraq and make a son with him, a son whose father is the harpy, whose mother is the dragon. In him the prophecies shall be fulfilled, and your enemies will melt away like snow.\u201d\nHe shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. They were made of words, and words were wind. There would be no son for Loraq, no heir to unite dragon and harpy. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. Only then would her womb quicken once again\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Daenerys Targaryen had other children, tens of thousands who had hailed her as their mother when she broke their chains. She thought of Stalwart Shield, of Missandei\u2019s brother, of the woman Rylona Rhee, who had played the harp so beautifully. No marriage would ever bring them back to life, but if a husband could help end the slaughter, then she owed it to her dead to marry.\nIf I wed Hizdahr, will that turn Skahaz against me? She trusted Skahaz more than she trusted Hizdahr, but the Shavepate would be a disaster as a king. He was too quick to anger, too slow to forgive. She saw no gain in wedding a man as hated as herself. Hizdahr was well respected, so far as she could see. \u201cWhat does my prospective husband think of this?\u201d she asked the Green Grace. What does he think of me?\n\u201cYour Grace need only ask him. The noble Hizdahr awaits below. Send down to him if that is your pleasure.\u201d\nYou presume too much, priestess, the queen thought, but she swallowed her anger and made herself smile. \u201cWhy not?\u201d She sent for Ser Barristan and told the old knight to bring Hizdahr to her. \u201cIt is a long climb. Have the Unsullied help him up.\u201d\nBy the time the nobleman had made the ascent, the Green Grace had finished eating. \u201cIf it please Your Magnificence, I will take my leave. You and the noble Hizdahr will have many things to discuss, I do not doubt.\u201d The old woman dabbed a smear of honey off her lips, gave Qezza and Grazhar each a parting kiss upon the brow, and fastened her silken veil across her face. \u201cI shall return to the Temple of the Graces and pray for the gods to show my queen the course of wisdom.\u201d\nWhen she was gone, Dany let Qezza fill her cup again, dismissed the children, and commanded that Hizdahr zo Loraq be admitted to her presence. And if he dares say one word about his precious fighting pits, I may have him thrown off the terrace.\nHizdahr wore a plain green robe beneath a quilted vest. He bowed low when he entered, his face solemn. \u201cHave you no smile for me?\u201d Dany asked him. \u201cAm I as fearful as all that?\u201d\n\u201cI always grow solemn in the presence of such beauty.\u201d\nIt was a good start. \u201cDrink with me.\u201d Dany filled his cup herself. \u201cYou know why you are here. The Green Grace seems to feel that if I take you for my husband, all my woes will vanish.\u201d\n\u201cI would never make so bold a claim. Men are born to strive and suffer. Our woes only vanish when we die. I can be of help to you, however. I have gold and friends and influence, and the blood of Old Ghis flows in my veins. Though I have never wed, I have two natural children, a boy and a girl, so I can give you heirs. I can reconcile the city to your rule and put an end to this nightly slaughter in the streets.\u201d\n\u201cCan you?\u201d Dany studied his eyes. \u201cWhy should the Sons of the Harpy lay down their knives for you? Are you one of them?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWould you tell me if you were?\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThe Shavepate has ways of finding the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI do not doubt that Skahaz would soon have me confessing. A day with him, and I will be one of the Harpy\u2019s Sons. Two days, and I will be the Harpy. Three, and it will turn out I slew your father too, back in the Sunset Kingdoms when I was yet a boy. Then he will impale me on a stake and you can watch me die\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but afterward the killings will go on.\u201d Hizdahr leaned closer. \u201cOr you can marry me and let me try to stop them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you want to help me? For the crown?\u201d\n\u201cA crown would suit me well, I will not deny that. It is more than that, however. Is it so strange that I would want to protect my own people, as you protect your freedmen? Meereen cannot endure another war, Your Radiance.\u201d\nThat was a good answer, and an honest one. \u201cI have never wanted war. I defeated the Yunkai\u2019i once and spared their city when I might have sacked it. I refused to join King Cleon when he marched against them. Even now, with Astapor besieged, I stay my hand. And Qarth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have never done the Qartheen any harm\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot by intent, no, but Qarth is a city of merchants, and they love the clink of silver coins, the gleam of yellow gold. When you smashed the slave trade, the blow was felt from Westeros to Asshai. Qarth depends upon its slaves. So too Tolos, New Ghis, Lys, Tyrosh, Volantis\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the list is long, my queen.\u201d\n\u201cLet them come. In me they shall find a sterner foe than Cleon. I would sooner perish fighting than return my children to bondage.\u201d\n\u201cThere may be another choice. The Yunkai\u2019i can be persuaded to allow all your freedmen to remain free, I believe, if Your Worship will agree that the Yellow City may trade and train slaves unmolested from this day forth. No more blood need flow.\u201d\n\u201cSave for the blood of those slaves that the Yunkai\u2019i will trade and train,\u201d Dany said, but she recognized the truth in his words even so. It may be that is the best end we can hope for. \u201cYou have not said you love me.\u201d\n\u201cI will, if it would please Your Radiance.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the answer of a man in love.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is love? Desire? No man with all his parts could ever look on you and not desire you, Daenerys. That is not why I would marry you, however. Before you came Meereen was dying. Our rulers were old men with withered cocks and crones whose puckered cunts were dry as dust. They sat atop their pyramids sipping apricot wine and talking of the glories of the Old Empire whilst the centuries slipped by and the very bricks of the city crumbled all around them. Custom and caution had an iron grip upon us till you awakened us with fire and blood. A new time has come, and new things are possible. Marry me.\u201d\nHe is not hard to look at, Dany told herself, and he has a king\u2019s tongue. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she commanded.\nHe took her hand again, and kissed her fingers.\n\u201cNot that way. Kiss me as if I were your wife.\u201d\nHizdahr took her by the shoulders as tenderly as if she were a baby bird. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips to hers. His kiss was light and dry and quick. Dany felt no stirrings.\n\u201cShall I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0kiss you again?\u201d he asked when it was over.\n\u201cNo.\u201d On her terrace, in her bathing pool, the little fish would nibble at her legs as she soaked. Even they kissed with more fervor than Hizdahr zo Loraq. \u201cI do not love you.\u201d\nHizdahr shrugged. \u201cThat may come, in time. It has been known to happen that way.\u201d\nNot with us, she thought. Not whilst Daario is so close. It\u2019s him I want, not you. \u201cOne day I will want to return to Westeros, to claim the Seven Kingdoms that were my father\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOne day all men must die, but it serves no good to dwell on death. I prefer to take each day as it comes.\u201d\nDany folded her hands together. \u201cWords are wind, even words like love and peace. I put more trust in deeds. In my Seven Kingdoms, knights go on quests to prove themselves worthy of the maiden that they love. They seek for magic swords, for chests of gold, for crowns stolen from a dragon\u2019s hoard.\u201d\nHizdahr arched an eyebrow. \u201cThe only dragons that I know are yours, and magic swords are even scarcer. I will gladly bring you rings and crowns and chests of gold if that is your desire.\u201d\n\u201cPeace is my desire. You say that you can help me end the nightly slaughter in my streets. I say do it. Put an end to this shadow war, my lord. That is your quest. Give me ninety days and ninety nights without a murder, and I will know that you are worthy of a throne. Can you do that?\u201d\nHizdahr looked thoughtful. \u201cNinety days and ninety nights without a corpse, and on the ninety-first we wed?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Dany, with a coy look. \u201cThough young girls have been known to be fickle. I may still want a magic sword.\u201d\nHizdahr laughed. \u201cThen you shall have that too, Radiance. Your wish is my command. Best tell your seneschal to begin making preparations for our wedding.\u201d\n\u201cNothing would please the noble Reznak more.\u201d If Meereen knew that a wedding was in the offing, that alone might buy her a few nights\u2019 respite, even if Hizdahr\u2019s efforts came to naught. The Shavepate will not be happy with me, but Reznak mo Reznak will dance for joy. Dany did not know which of those concerned her more. She needed Skahaz and the Brazen Beasts, and she had come to mistrust all of Reznak\u2019s counsel. Beware the perfumed seneschal. Has Reznak made common cause with Hizdahr and the Green Grace and set some trap to snare me?\nNo sooner had Hizdahr zo Loraq taken his leave of her than Ser Barristan appeared behind her in his long white cloak. Years of service in the Kingsguard had taught the white knight how to remain unobtrusive when she was entertaining, but he was never far. He knows, she saw at once, and he disapproves. The lines around his mouth had deepened. \u201cSo,\u201d she said to him, \u201cit seems that I may wed again. Are you happy for me, ser?\u201d\n\u201cIf that is your command, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cHizdahr is not the husband you would have chosen for me.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not my place to choose your husband.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut it is important to me that you should understand. My people are bleeding. Dying. A queen belongs not to herself, but to the realm. Marriage or carnage, those are my choices. A wedding or a war.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace, may I speak frankly?\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a third choice.\u201d\n\u201cWesteros?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cI am sworn to serve Your Grace, and to keep you safe from harm wherever you may go. My place is by your side, whether here or in King\u2019s Landing\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but your place is back in Westeros, upon the Iron Throne that was your father\u2019s. The Seven Kingdoms will never accept Hizdahr zo Loraq as king.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than Meereen will accept Daenerys Targaryen as queen. The Green Grace has the right of that. I need a king beside me, a king of old Ghiscari blood. Elsewise they will always see me as the uncouth barbarian who smashed through their gates, impaled their kin on spikes, and stole their wealth.\u201d\n\u201cIn Westeros you will be the lost child who returns to gladden her father\u2019s heart. Your people will cheer when you ride by, and all good men will love you.\u201d\n\u201cWesteros is far away.\u201d\n\u201cLingering here will never bring it any closer. The sooner we take our leave of this place\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know. I do.\u201d Dany did not know how to make him see. She wanted Westeros as much as he did, but first she must heal Meereen. \u201cNinety days is a long time. Hizdahr may fail. And if he does, the trying buys me time. Time to make alliances, to strengthen my defenses, to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he does not fail? What will Your Grace do then?\u201d\n\u201cHer duty.\u201d The word felt cold upon her tongue. \u201cYou saw my brother Rhaegar wed. Tell me, did he wed for love or duty?\u201d\nThe old knight hesitated. \u201cPrincess Elia was a good woman, Your Grace. She was kind and clever, with a gentle heart and a sweet wit. I know the prince was very fond of her.\u201d\nFond, thought Dany. The word spoke volumes. I could become fond of Hizdahr zo Loraq, in time. Perhaps.\nSer Barristan went on. \u201cI saw your father and your mother wed as well. Forgive me, but there was no fondness there, and the realm paid dearly for that, my queen.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did they wed if they did not love each other?\u201d\n\u201cYour grandsire commanded it. A woods witch had told him that the prince was promised would be born of their line.\u201d\n\u201cA woods witch?\u201d Dany was astonished.\n\u201cShe came to court with Jenny of Oldstones. A stunted thing, grotesque to look upon. A dwarf, most people said, though dear to Lady Jenny, who always claimed that she was one of the children of the forest.\u201d\n\u201cWhat became of her?\u201d\n\u201cSummerhall.\u201d The word was fraught with doom.\nDany sighed. \u201cLeave me now. I am very weary.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d Ser Barristan bowed and turned to go. But at the door, he stopped. \u201cForgive me. Your Grace has a visitor. Shall I tell him to return upon the morrow?\u201d\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\u201cNaharis. The Stormcrows have returned to the city.\u201d\nDaario. Her heart gave a flutter in her chest. \u201cHow long has\u00a0\u2026\u00a0when did he \u2026?\u201d She could not seem to get the words out.\nSer Barristan seemed to understand. \u201cYour Grace was with the priestess when he arrived. I knew you would not want to be disturbed. The captain\u2019s news can wait until the morrow.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d How could I ever hope to sleep, knowing that my captain so close? \u201cSend him up at once. And\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will have no more need of you this evening. I shall be safe with Daario. Oh, and send Irri and Jhiqui, if you would be so good. And Missandei.\u201d I need to change, to make myself beautiful.\nShe said as much to her handmaids when they came. \u201cWhat does Your Grace wish to wear?\u201d asked Missandei.\nStarlight and seafoam, Dany thought, a wisp of silk that leaves my left breast bare for Daario\u2019s delight. Oh, and flowers for my hair. When first they met, the captain brought her flowers every day, all the way from Yunkai to Meereen. \u201cBring the grey linen gown with the pearls on the bodice. Oh, and my white lion\u2019s pelt.\u201d She always felt safer wrapped in Drogo\u2019s lionskin.\nDaenerys received the captain on her terrace, seated on a carved stone bench beneath a pear tree. A half-moon floated in the sky above the city, attended by a thousand stars. Daario Naharis entered swaggering. He swaggers even when he is standing still. The captain wore striped pantaloons tucked into high boots of purple leather, a white silk shirt, a vest of golden rings. His trident beard was purple, his flamboyant mustachios gold, his long curls equal parts of both. On one hip he wore a stiletto, on the other a Dothraki arakh. \u201cBright queen,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have grown more beautiful in my absence. How is this thing possible?\u201d\nThe queen was accustomed to such praise, yet somehow the compliment meant more coming from Daario than from the likes of Reznak, Xaro, or Hizdahr. \u201cCaptain. They tell us you did us good service in Lhazar.\u201d I have missed you so much.\n\u201cYour captain lives to serve his cruel queen.\u201d\n\u201cCruel?\u201d\nMoonlight glimmered in his eyes. \u201cHe raced ahead of all his men to see her face the sooner, only to be left languishing whilst she ate lamb and figs with some dried-up old woman.\u201d\nThey never told me you were here, Dany thought, or I might have played the fool and sent for you at once. \u201cI was supping with the Green Grace.\u201d It seemed best not to mention Hizdahr. \u201cI had urgent need of her wise counsel.\u201d\n\u201cI have only one urgent need: Daenerys.\u201d\n\u201cShall I send for food? You must be hungry.\u201d\n\u201cI have not eaten in two days, but now that I am here, it is enough for me to feast upon your beauty.\u201d\n\u201cMy beauty will not fill up your belly.\u201d She plucked down a pear and tossed it at him. \u201cEat this.\u201d\n\u201cIf my queen commands it.\u201d He took a bite of the pear, his gold tooth gleaming. Juice ran down into his purple beard.\nThe girl in her wanted to kiss him so much it hurt. His kisses would be hard and cruel, she told herself, and he would not care if I cried out or commanded him to stop. But the queen in her knew that would be folly. \u201cTell me of your journey.\u201d\nHe gave a careless shrug. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i sent some hired swords to close the Khyzai Pass. The Long Lances, they name themselves. We descended on them in the night and sent a few to hell. In Lhazar I slew two of my own serjeants for plotting to steal the gems and gold plate my queen had entrusted to me as gifts for the Lamb Men. Elsewise, all went as I had promised.\u201d\n\u201cHow many men did you lose in the fighting?\u201d\n\u201cNine,\u201d said Daario, \u201cbut a dozen of the Long Lances decided they would sooner be Stormcrows than corpses, so we came out three ahead. I told them they would live longer fighting with your dragons than against them, and they saw the wisdom in my words.\u201d\nThat made her wary. \u201cThey might be spying for Yunkai.\u201d\n\u201cThey are too stupid to be spies. You do not know them.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do you. Do you trust them?\u201d\n\u201cI trust all my men. Just as far as I can spit.\u201d He spat out a seed and smiled at her suspicions. \u201cShall I bring their heads to you? I will, if you command it. One is bald and two have braids and one dyes his beard four different colors. What spy would wear such a beard, I ask you? The slinger can put a stone through a gnat\u2019s eye at forty paces, and the ugly one has a way with horses, but if my queen says that they must die\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI did not say that. I only\u00a0\u2026\u00a0see that you keep your eye on them, that\u2019s all.\u201d She felt foolish saying it. She always felt a little foolish when she was with Daario. Gawky and girlish and slow-witted. What must he think of me? She changed the subject. \u201cWill the Lamb Men send us food?\u201d\n\u201cGrain will come down the Skahazadhan by barge, my queen, and other goods by caravan over the Khyzai.\u201d\n\u201cNot the Skahazadhan. The river has been closed to us. The seas as well. You will have seen the ships out in the bay. The Qartheen have driven off a third of our fishing fleet and seized another third. The others are too frightened to leave port. What little trade we still had has been cut off.\u201d\nDaario tossed away the pear stem. \u201cQartheen have milk in their veins. Let them see your dragons, and they\u2019ll run.\u201d\nDany did not want to talk about the dragons. Farmers still came to her court with burned bones, complaining of missing sheep, though Drogon had not returned to the city. Some reported seeing him north of the river, above the grass of the Dothraki sea. Down in the pit, Viserion had snapped one of his chains; he and Rhaegal grew more savage every day. Once the iron doors had glowed red-hot, her Unsullied told her, and no one dared to touch them for a day. \u201cAstapor is under siege as well.\u201d\n\u201cThis I knew. One of the Long Lances lived long enough to tell us that men were eating one another in the Red City. He said Meereen\u2019s turn would come soon, so I cut his tongue out and fed it to a yellow dog. No dog will eat a liar\u2019s tongue. When the yellow dog ate his, I knew he spoke the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI have war inside the city too.\u201d She told him of the Harpy\u2019s Sons and the Brazen Beasts, of blood upon the bricks. \u201cMy enemies are all around me, within the city and without.\u201d\n\u201cAttack,\u201d he said at once. \u201cA man surrounded by foes cannot defend himself. Try, and the axe will take you in the back whilst you are parrying the sword. No. When faced with many enemies, choose the weakest, kill him, ride over him, and escape.\u201d\n\u201cWhere should I escape to?\u201d\n\u201cInto my bed. Into my arms. Into my heart.\u201d The hilts of Daario\u2019s arakh and stiletto were wrought in the shape of golden women, naked and wanton. He brushed his thumbs across them in a way that was remarkably obscene and smiled a wicked smile.\nDany felt blood rushing to her face. It was almost as if he were caressing her. Would he think me wanton too if I pulled him into bed? He made her want to be his wanton. I should never see him alone. He is too dangerous to have near me. \u201cThe Green Grace says that I must take a Ghiscari king,\u201d she said, flustered. \u201cShe urges me to wed the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq.\u201d\n\u201cThat one?\u201d Daario chuckled. \u201cWhy not Grey Worm, if you want a eunuch in your bed? Do you want a king?\u201d\nI want you. \u201cI want peace. I gave Hizdahr ninety days to end the killings. If he does, I will take him for a husband.\u201d\n\u201cTake me for your husband. I will do it in nine.\u201d\nYou know I cannot do that, she almost said.\n\u201cYou are fighting shadows when you should be fighting the men who cast them,\u201d Daario went on. \u201cKill them all and take their treasures, I say. Whisper the command, and your Daario will make you a pile of their heads taller than this pyramid.\u201d\n\u201cIf I knew who they were\u2014\u201d\n\u201cZhak and Pahl and Merreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?\u201d\nHe is as bold as he is bloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. Would you have me slaughter my own subjects?\u201d\n\u201cYour own subjects would gladly slaughter you.\u201d\nHe had been so long away, Dany had almost forgotten what he was. Sellswords were treacherous by nature, she reminded herself. Fickle, faithless, brutal. He will never be more than he is. He will never be the stuff of kings. \u201cThe pyramids are strong,\u201d she explained to him. \u201cWe could take them only at great cost. The moment we attack one the others will rise against us.\u201d\n\u201cThen winkle them out of their pyramids on some pretext. A wedding might serve. Why not? Promise your hand to Hizdahr and all the Great Masters will come to see you married. When they gather in the Temple of the Graces, turn us loose upon them.\u201d\nDany was appalled. He is a monster. A gallant monster, but a monster still. \u201cDo you take me for the Butcher King?\u201d\n\u201cBetter the butcher than the meat. All kings are butchers. Are queens so different?\u201d\n\u201cThis queen is.\u201d\nDaario shrugged. \u201cMost queens have no purpose but to warm some king\u2019s bed and pop out sons for him. If that\u2019s the sort of queen you mean to be, best marry Hizdahr.\u201d\nHer anger flashed. \u201cHave you forgotten who I am?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d\nViserys would have his head off for that insolence. \u201cI am the blood of the dragon. Do not presume to teach me lessons.\u201d When Dany stood, the lion pelt slipped from her shoulders and tumbled to the ground. \u201cLeave me.\u201d\nDaario gave her a sweeping bow. \u201cI live to obey.\u201d\nWhen he was gone, Daenerys called Ser Barristan back. \u201cI want the Stormcrows back in the field.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace? They have only now returned\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI want them gone. Let them scout the Yunkish hinterlands and give protection to any caravans coming over the Khyzai Pass. Henceforth Daario shall make his reports to you. Give him every honor that is due him and see that his men are well paid, but on no account admit him to my presence.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Your Grace.\u201d\nThat night she could not sleep but turned and twisted restlessly in her bed. She even went so far as to summon Irri, hoping her caresses might help ease her way to rest, but after a short while she pushed the Dothraki girl away. Irri was sweet and soft and willing, but she was not Daario.\nWhat have I done? she thought, huddled in her empty bed. I have waited so long for him to come back, and I send him away. \u201cHe would make a monster of me,\u201d she whispered, \u201ca butcher queen.\u201d But then she thought of Drogon far away, and the dragons in the pit. There is blood on my hands too, and on my heart. We are not so different, Daario and I. We are both monsters.",

      "content": "THE LOST LORD\nIt should not have taken this long, Griff told himself as he paced the deck of the Shy Maid. Had they lost Haldon as they had Tyrion Lannister? Could the Volantenes have taken him? I should have sent Duckfield with him. Haldon alone could not be trusted; he had proved that in Selhorys when he let the dwarf escape.\nThe Shy Maid was tied up in one of the meaner sections of the long, chaotic riverfront, between a listing poleboat that had not left the pier in years and the gaily painted mummers\u2019 barge. The mummers were a loud and lively lot, always quoting speeches at each other and drunk more oft than not.\nThe day was hot and sticky, as all the days had been since they left the Sorrows. A ferocious southern sun beat down upon the crowded riverfront of Volon Therys, but heat was the last and least of Griff\u2019s concerns. The Golden Company was encamped three miles south of town, well north of where he had expected them, and Triarch Malaquo had come north with five thousand foot and a thousand horse to cut them off from the delta road. Daenerys Targaryen remained a world away, and Tyrion Lannister\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, he could be most anywhere. If the gods were good, Lannister\u2019s severed head was halfway back to King\u2019s Landing by now, but more like the dwarf was hale and whole and somewhere close, stinking drunk and plotting some new infamy.\n\u201cWhere in the seven hells is Haldon?\u201d Griff complained to Lady Lemore. \u201cHow long should it take to buy three horses?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cMy lord, wouldn\u2019t it be safer to leave the boy here aboard the boat?\u201d\n\u201cSafer, yes. Wiser, no. He is a man grown now, and this is the road that he was born to walk.\u201d Griff had no patience for this quibbling. He was sick of hiding, sick of waiting, sick of caution. I do not have time enough for caution.\n\u201cWe have gone to great lengths to keep Prince Aegon hidden all these years,\u201d Lemore reminded him. \u201cThe time will come for him to wash his hair and declare himself, I know, but that time is not now. Not to a camp of sellswords.\u201d\n\u201cIf Harry Strickland means him ill, hiding him on the Shy Maid will not protect him. Strickland has ten thousand swords at his command. We have Duck. Aegon is all that could be wanted in a prince. They need to see that, Strickland and the rest. These are his own men.\u201d\n\u201cHis because they\u2019re bought and paid for. Ten thousand armed strangers, plus hangers-on and camp followers. All it takes is one to bring us all to ruin. If Hugor\u2019s head was worth a lord\u2019s honors, how much will Cersei Lannister pay for the rightful heir to the Iron Throne? You do not know these men, my lord. It has been a dozen years since you last rode with the Golden Company, and your old friend is dead.\u201d\nBlackheart. Myles Toyne had been so full of life the last time Griff had left him, it was hard to accept that he was gone. A golden skull atop a pole, and Homeless Harry Strickland in his place. Lemore was not wrong, he knew. Whatever their sires or their grandsires might have been back in Westeros before their exile, the men of the Golden Company were sellswords now, and no sellsword could be trusted. Even so\u00a0\u2026\nLast night he\u2019d dreamt of Stoney Sept again. Alone, with sword in hand, he ran from house to house, smashing down doors, racing up stairs, leaping from roof to roof, as his ears rang to the sound of distant bells. Deep bronze booms and silver chiming pounded through his skull, a maddening cacophony of noise that grew ever louder until it seemed as if his head would explode.\nSeventeen years had come and gone since the Battle of the Bells, yet the sound of bells ringing still tied a knot in his guts. Others might claim that the realm was lost when Prince Rhaegar fell to Robert\u2019s warhammer on the Trident, but the Battle of the Trident would never have been fought if the griffin had only slain the stag there in Stoney Sept. The bells tolled for all of us that day. For Aerys and his queen, for Elia of Dorne and her little daughter, for every true man and honest woman in the Seven Kingdoms. And for my silver prince.\n\u201cThe plan was to reveal Prince Aegon only when we reached Queen Daenerys,\u201d Lemore was saying.\n\u201cThat was when we believed the girl was coming west. Our dragon queen has burned that plan to ash, and thanks to that fat fool in Pentos, we have grasped the she-dragon by the tail and burned our fingers to the bone.\u201d\n\u201cIllyrio could not have been expected to know that the girl would choose to remain at Slaver\u2019s Bay.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than he knew that the Beggar King would die young, or that Khal Drogo would follow him into the grave. Very little of what the fat man has anticipated has come to pass.\u201d Griff slapped the hilt of his longsword with a gloved hand. \u201cI have danced to the fat man\u2019s pipes for years, Lemore. What has it availed us? The prince is a man grown. His time is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGriff,\u201d Yandry called loudly, above the clanging of the mummers\u2019 bell. \u201cIt\u2019s Haldon.\u201d\nSo it was. The Halfmaester looked hot and bedraggled as he made his way along the waterfront to the foot of the pier. Sweat had left dark rings beneath the arms of his light linen robes, and he had the same sour look on his long face as at Selhorys, when he returned to the Shy Maid to confess that the dwarf was gone. He was leading three horses, however, and that was all that mattered.\n\u201cBring the boy,\u201d Griff told Lemore. \u201cSee that he\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say,\u201d she answered, unhappily.\nSo be it. He had grown fond of Lemore, but that did not mean he required her approval. Her task had been to instruct the prince in the doctrines of the Faith, and she had done that. No amount of prayer would put him on the Iron Throne, however. That was Griff\u2019s task. He had failed Prince Rhaegar once. He would not fail his son, not whilst life remained in his body.\nHaldon\u2019s horses did not please him. \u201cWere these the best that you could find?\u201d he complained to the Halfmaester.\n\u201cThey were,\u201d said Haldon, in an irritated tone, \u201cand you had best not ask what they cost us. With Dothraki across the river, half the populace of Volon Therys has decided they would sooner be elsewhere, so horseflesh grows more expensive every day.\u201d\nI should have gone myself. After Selhorys, he had found it difficult to put the same trust in Haldon as previously. He let the dwarf beguile him with that glib tongue of his. Let him wander off into a whorehouse alone while he lingered like a mooncalf in the square. The brothel keeper had insisted that the little man had been carried off at swordpoint, but Griff was still not sure he believed that. The Imp was clever enough to have conspired in his own escape. This drunken captor that the whores spoke of could have been some henchman in his hire. I share the blame. After the dwarf put himself between Aegon and the stone man, I let down my guard. I should have slit his throat the first time I laid eyes on him.\n\u201cThey will do well enough, I suppose,\u201d he told Haldon. \u201cThe camp is only three miles south.\u201d The Shy Maid would have gotten them there more quickly, but he preferred to keep Harry Strickland ignorant of where he and the prince had been. Nor did he relish the prospect of splashing through the shallows to climb some muddy riverbank. That sort of entrance might serve for a sellsword and his son, but not for a great lord and his prince.\nWhen the lad emerged from the cabin with Lemore by his side, Griff looked him over carefully from head to heel. The prince wore sword and dagger, black boots polished to a high sheen, a black cloak lined with blood-red silk. With his hair washed and cut and freshly dyed a deep, dark blue, his eyes looked blue as well. At his throat he wore three huge square-cut rubies on a chain of black iron, a gift from Magister Illyrio. Red and black. Dragon colors. That was good. \u201cYou look a proper prince,\u201d he told the boy. \u201cYour father would be proud if he could see you.\u201d\nYoung Griff ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI am sick of this blue dye. We should have washed it out.\u201d\n\u201cSoon enough.\u201d Griff would be glad to go back to his own true colors too, though his once red hair had gone to grey. He clapped the lad on the shoulder. \u201cShall we go? Your army awaits your coming.\u201d\n\u201cI like the sound of that. My army.\u201d A smile flashed across his face, then vanished. \u201cAre they, though? They\u2019re sellswords. Yollo warned me to trust no one.\u201d\n\u201cThere is wisdom in that,\u201d Griff admitted. It might have been different if Blackheart still commanded, but Myles Toyne was four years dead, and Homeless Harry Strickland was a different sort of man. He would not say that to the boy, however. That dwarf had already planted enough doubts in his young head. \u201cNot every man is what he seems, and a prince especially has good cause to be wary\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but go too far down that road, and the mistrust can poison you, make you sour and fearful.\u201d King Aerys was one such. By the end, even Rhaegar saw that plain enough. \u201cYou would do best to walk a middle course. Let men earn your trust with leal service\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but when they do, be generous and openhearted.\u201d\nThe boy nodded. \u201cI will remember.\u201d\nThey gave the prince the best of the three horses, a big grey gelding so pale that he was almost white. Griff and Haldon rode beside him on lesser mounts. The road ran south beneath the high white walls of Volon Therys for a good half mile. Then they left the town behind, following the winding course of the Rhoyne through willow groves and poppy fields and past a tall wooden windmill whose blades creaked like old bones as they turned.\nThey found the Golden Company beside the river as the sun was lowering in the west. It was a camp that even Arthur Dayne might have approved of\u2014compact, orderly, defensible. A deep ditch had been dug around it, with sharpened stakes inside. The tents stood in rows, with broad avenues between them. The latrines had been placed beside the river, so the current would wash away the wastes. The horse lines were to the north, and beyond them, two dozen elephants grazed beside the water, pulling up reeds with their trunks. Griff glanced at the great grey beasts with approval. There is not a warhorse in all of Westeros that will stand against them.\nTall battle standards of cloth-of-gold flapped atop lofty poles along the perimeters of the camp. Beneath them, armed and armored sentries walked their rounds with spears and crossbows, watching every approach. Griff had feared that the company might have grown lax under Harry Strickland, who had always seemed more concerned with making friends than enforcing discipline; but it would seem his worries had been misplaced.\nAt the gate, Haldon said something to the serjeant of guards, and a runner was sent off to find a captain. When he turned up, he was just as ugly as the last time Griff laid eyes on him. A big-bellied, shambling hulk of a man, the sellsword had a seamed face crisscrossed with old scars. His right ear looked as if a dog had chewed on it and his left was missing. \u201cHave they made you a captain, Flowers?\u201d Griff said. \u201cI thought the Golden Company had standards.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than that, you bugger,\u201d said Franklyn Flowers. \u201cThey knighted me as well.\u201d He clasped Griff by the forearm, pulled him into a bone-crushing hug. \u201cYou look awful, even for a man\u2019s been dead a dozen years. Blue hair, is it? When Harry said you\u2019d be turning up, I almost shit myself. And Haldon, you icy cunt, good to see you too. Still have that stick up your arse?\u201d He turned to Young Griff. \u201cAnd this would be\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy squire. Lad, this is Franklyn Flowers.\u201d\nThe prince acknowledged him with a nod. \u201cFlowers is a bastard name. You\u2019re from the Reach.\u201d\n\u201cAye. My mother was a washerwoman at Cider Hall till one of milord\u2019s sons raped her. Makes me a sort o\u2019 brown apple Fossoway, the way I see it.\u201d Flowers waved them through the gate. \u201cCome with me. Strickland\u2019s called all the officers to his tent. War council. The bloody Volantenes are rattling their spears and demanding to know our intentions.\u201d\nThe men of the Golden Company were outside their tents, dicing, drinking, and swatting away flies. Griff wondered how many of them knew who he was. Few enough. Twelve years is a long time. Even the men who\u2019d ridden with him might not recognize the exile lord Jon Connington of the fiery red beard in the lined, clean-shaved face and dyed blue hair of the sellsword Griff. So far as most of them were concerned, Connington had drunk himself to death in Lys after being driven from the company in disgrace for stealing from the war chest. The shame of the lie still stuck in his craw, but Varys had insisted it was necessary. \u201cWe want no songs about the gallant exile,\u201d the eunuch had tittered, in that mincing voice of his. \u201cThose who die heroic deaths are long remembered, thieves and drunks and cravens soon forgotten.\u201d\nWhat does a eunuch know of a man\u2019s honor? Griff had gone along with the Spider\u2019s scheme for the boy\u2019s sake, but that did not mean he liked it any better. Let me live long enough to see the boy sit the Iron Throne, and Varys will pay for that slight and so much more. Then we\u2019ll see who\u2019s soon forgotten.\nThe captain-general\u2019s tent was made of cloth-of-gold and surrounded by a ring of pikes topped with gilded skulls. One skull was larger than the rest, grotesquely malformed. Below it was a second, no larger than a child\u2019s fist. Maelys the Monstrous and his nameless brother. The other skulls had a sameness to them, though several had been cracked and splintered by the blows that had slain them, and one had filed, pointed teeth. \u201cWhich one is Myles?\u201d Griff found himself asking.\n\u201cThere. On the end.\u201d Flowers pointed. \u201cWait. I\u2019ll go announce you.\u201d He slipped inside the tent, leaving Griff to contemplate the gilded skull of his old friend. In life, Ser Myles Toyne had been ugly as sin. His famous forebear, the dark and dashing Terrence Toyne of whom the singers sang, had been so fair of face that even the king\u2019s mistress could not resist him; but Myles had been possessed of jug ears, a crooked jaw, and the biggest nose that Jon Connington had ever seen. When he smiled at you, though, none of that mattered. Blackheart, his men had named him, for the sigil on his shield. Myles had loved the name and all it hinted at. \u201cA captain-general should be feared, by friend and foe alike,\u201d he had once confessed. \u201cIf men think me cruel, so much the better.\u201d The truth was otherwise. Soldier to the bone, Toyne was fierce but always fair, a father to his men and always generous to the exile lord Jon Connington.\nDeath had robbed him of his ears, his nose, and all his warmth. The smile remained, transformed into a glittering golden grin. All the skulls were grinning, even Bittersteel\u2019s on the tall pike in the center. What does he have to grin about? He died defeated and alone, a broken man in an alien land. On his deathbed, Ser Aegor Rivers had famously commanded his men to boil the flesh from his skull, dip it in gold, and carry it before them when they crossed the sea to retake Westeros. His successors had followed his example.\nJon Connington might have been one of those successors if his exile had gone otherwise. He had spent five years with the company, rising from the ranks to a place of honor at Toyne\u2019s right hand. Had he stayed, it might well have been him the men turned to after Myles died, instead of Harry Strickland. But Griff did not regret the path he\u2019d chosen. When I return to Westeros, it will not be as a skull atop a pole.\nFlowers stepped out of the tent. \u201cGo on in.\u201d\nThe high officers of the Golden Company rose from stools and camp chairs as they entered. Old friends greeted Griff with smiles and embraces, the new men more formally. Not all of them are as glad to see us as they would have me believe. He sensed knives behind some of the smiles. Until quite recently, most of them had believed that Lord Jon Connington was safely in his grave, and no doubt many felt that was a fine place for him, a man who would steal from his brothers-in-arms. Griff might have felt the same way in their place.\nSer Franklyn did the introductions. Some of the sellsword captains bore bastard names, as Flowers did: Rivers, Hill, Stone. Others claimed names that had once loomed large in the histories of the Seven Kingdoms; Griff counted two Strongs, three Peakes, a Mudd, a Mandrake, a Lothston, a pair of Coles. Not all were genuine, he knew. In the free companies, a man could call himself whatever he chose. By any name, the sellswords displayed a rude splendor. Like many in their trade, they kept their worldly wealth upon their persons: jeweled swords, inlaid armor, heavy torcs, and fine silks were much in evidence, and every man there wore a lord\u2019s ransom in golden arm rings. Each ring signified one year\u2019s service with the Golden Company. Marq Mandrake, whose pox-scarred face had a hole in one cheek where a slave\u2019s mark had been burned away, wore a chain of golden skulls as well.\nNot every captain was of Westerosi blood. Black Balaq, a white-haired Summer Islander with skin dark as soot, commanded the company\u2019s archers, as in Blackheart\u2019s day. He wore a feathered cloak of green and orange, magnificent to behold. The cadaverous Volantene, Gorys Edoryen, had replaced Strickland as paymaster. A leopard skin was draped across one shoulder, and hair as red as blood tumbled to his shoulders in oiled ringlets though his pointed beard was black. The spymaster was new to Griff, a Lyseni named Lysono Maar, with lilac eyes and white-gold hair and lips that would have been the envy of a whore. At first glance, Griff had almost taken him for a woman. His fingernails were painted purple, and his earlobes dripped with pearls and amethysts.\nGhosts and liars, Griff thought, as he surveyed their faces. Revenants from forgotten wars, lost causes, failed rebellions, a brotherhood of the failed and the fallen, the disgraced and the disinherited. This is my army. This is our best hope.\nHe turned to Harry Strickland.\nHomeless Harry looked little like a warrior. Portly, with a big round head, mild grey eyes, and thinning hair that he brushed sideways to conceal a bald spot, Strickland sat in a camp chair soaking his feet in a tub of salt water. \u201cYou will pardon me if I do not rise,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cOur march was wearisome, and my toes are prone to blisters. It is a curse.\u201d\nIt is a mark of weakness. You sound like an old woman. The Stricklands had been part of the Golden Company since its founding, Harry\u2019s great-grandsire having lost his lands when he rose with the Black Dragon during the first Blackfyre Rebellion. \u201cGold for four generations,\u201d Harry would boast, as if four generations of exile and defeat were something to take pride in.\n\u201cI can make you an ointment for that,\u201d said Haldon, \u201cand there are certain mineral salts that will toughen your skin.\u201d\n\u201cThat is kind of you.\u201d Strickland beckoned to his squire. \u201cWatkyn, wine for our friends.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, but no,\u201d said Griff. \u201cWe will drink water.\u201d\n\u201cAs you prefer.\u201d The captain-general smiled up at the prince. \u201cAnd this must be your son.\u201d\nDoes he know? Griff wondered. How much did Myles tell him? Varys had been adamant about the need for secrecy. The plans that he and Illyrio had made with Blackheart had been known to them alone. The rest of the company had been left ignorant. What they did not know they could not let slip.\nThat time was done, though. \u201cNo man could have asked for a worthier son,\u201d Griff said, \u201cbut the lad is not of my blood, and his name is not Griff. My lords, I give you Aegon Targaryen, firstborn son of Rhaegar, Prince of Dragonstone, by Princess Elia of Dorne\u00a0\u2026\u00a0soon, with your help, to be Aegon, the Sixth of His Name, King of Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\nSilence greeted his announcement. Someone cleared his throat. One of the Coles refilled his wine cup from the flagon. Gorys Edoryen played with one of his corkscrew ringlets and murmured something in a tongue Griff did not know. Laswell Peake coughed, Mandrake and Lothston exchanged a glance. They know, Griff realized then. They have known all along. He turned to look at Harry Strickland. \u201cWhen did you tell them?\u201d\nThe captain-general wriggled his blistered toes in his footbath. \u201cWhen we reached the river. The company was restless, with good reason. We walked away from an easy campaign in the Disputed Lands, and for what? So we could swelter in this god-awful heat watching our coins melt away and our blades go to rust whilst I turn away rich contracts?\u201d\nThat news made Griff\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThe Yunkishmen. The envoy that they sent to woo Volantis has already dispatched three free companies to Slaver\u2019s Bay. He wishes us to be the fourth and offers twice what Myr was paying us, plus a slave for every man in the company, ten for every officer, and a hundred choice maidens all for me.\u201d\nBloody hell. \u201cThat would require thousands of slaves. Where do the Yunkishmen expect to find so many?\u201d\n\u201cIn Meereen.\u201d Strickland beckoned to his squire. \u201cWatkyn, a towel. This water\u2019s growing cool, and my toes have wrinkled up like raisins. No, not that towel, the soft one.\u201d\n\u201cYou refused him,\u201d said Griff.\n\u201cI told him I would think on his proposal.\u201d Harry winced as his squire toweled his feet. \u201cGentle with the toes. Think of them as thin-skinned grapes, lad. You want to dry them without crushing them. Pat, do not scrub. Yes, like that.\u201d He turned back to Griff. \u201cA blunt refusal would have been unwise. The men might rightly ask if I had taken leave of my wits.\u201d\n\u201cYou will have work for your blades soon enough.\u201d\n\u201cWill we?\u201d asked Lysono Maar. \u201cI assume you know that the Targaryen girl has not started for the west?\u201d\n\u201cWe heard that tale in Selhorys.\u201d\n\u201cNo tale. Simple truth. The why of it is harder to grasp. Sack Meereen, aye, why not? I would have done the same in her place. The slaver cities reek of gold, and conquest requires coin. But why linger? Fear? Madness? Sloth?\u201d\n\u201cThe why of it does not matter.\u201d Harry Strickland unrolled a pair of striped woolen stockings. \u201cShe is in Meereen and we are here, where the Volantenes grow daily more unhappy with our presence. We came to raise up a king and queen who would lead us home to Westeros, but this Targaryen girl seems more intent on planting olive trees than in reclaiming her father\u2019s throne. Meanwhile, her foes gather. Yunkai, New Ghis, Tolos. Bloodbeard and the Tattered Prince will both be in the field against her\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and soon enough the fleets of Old Volantis will descend on her as well. What does she have? Bedslaves with sticks?\u201d\n\u201cUnsullied,\u201d said Griff. \u201cAnd dragons.\u201d\n\u201cDragons, aye,\u201d the captain-general said, \u201cbut young ones, hardly more than hatchlings.\u201d Strickland eased his sock over his blisters and up his ankle. \u201cHow much will they avail her when all these armies close about her city like a fist?\u201d\nTristan Rivers drummed his fingers on his knee. \u201cAll the more reason that we must reach her quickly, I say. If Daenerys will not come to us, we must go to Daenerys.\u201d\n\u201cCan we walk across the waves, ser?\u201d asked Lysono Maar. \u201cI tell you again, we cannot reach the silver queen by sea. I slipped into Volantis myself, posing as a trader, to learn how many ships might be available to us. The harbor teems with galleys, cogs, and carracks of every sort and size, yet even so I soon found myself consorting with smugglers and pirates. We have ten thousand men in the company, as I am sure Lord Connington remembers from his years of service with us. Five hundred knights, each with three horses. Five hundred squires, with one mount apiece. And elephants, we must not forget the elephants. A pirate ship will not suffice. We would need a pirate fleet\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and even if we found one, the word has come back from Slaver\u2019s Bay that Meereen has been closed off by blockade.\u201d\n\u201cWe could feign acceptance of the Yunkish offer,\u201d urged Gorys Edoryen. \u201cAllow the Yunkai\u2019i to transport us to the east, then return their gold beneath the walls of Meereen.\u201d\n\u201cOne broken contract is stain enough upon the honor of the company.\u201d Homeless Harry Strickland paused with his blistered foot in hand. \u201cLet me remind you, it was Myles Toyne who put his seal to this secret pact, not me. I would honor his agreement if I could, but how? It seems plain to me that the Targaryen girl is never coming west. Westeros was her father\u2019s kingdom. Meereen is hers. If she can break the Yunkai\u2019i, she\u2019ll be Queen of Slaver\u2019s Bay. If not, she\u2019ll die long before we could hope to reach her.\u201d\nHis words came as no surprise to Griff. Harry Strickland had always been a genial man, better at hammering out contracts than at hammering on foes. He had a nose for gold, but whether he had the belly for battle was another question.\n\u201cThere is the land route,\u201d suggested Franklyn Flowers.\n\u201cThe demon road is death. We will lose half the company to desertion if we attempt that march, and bury half of those who remain beside the road. It grieves me to say it, but Magister Illyrio and his friends may have been unwise to put so much hope on this child queen.\u201d\nNo, thought Griff, but they were most unwise to put their hopes on you.\nAnd then Prince Aegon spoke. \u201cThen put your hopes on me,\u201d he said. \u201cDaenerys is Prince Rhaegar\u2019s sister, but I am Rhaegar\u2019s son. I am the only dragon that you need.\u201d\nGriff put a black-gloved hand upon Prince Aegon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSpoken boldly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut think what you are saying.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d the lad insisted. \u201cWhy should I go running to my aunt as if I were a beggar? My claim is better than her own. Let her come to me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0in Westeros.\u201d\nFranklyn Flowers laughed. \u201cI like it. Sail west, not east. Leave the little queen to her olives and seat Prince Aegon upon the Iron Throne. The boy has stones, give him that.\u201d\nThe captain-general looked as if someone had slapped his face. \u201cHas the sun curdled your brains, Flowers? We need the girl. We need the marriage. If Daenerys accepts our princeling and takes him for her consort, the Seven Kingdoms will do the same. Without her, the lords will only mock his claim and brand him a fraud and a pretender. And how do you propose to get to Westeros? You heard Lysono. There are no ships to be had.\u201d\nThis man is afraid to fight, Griff realized. How could they have chosen him to take the Blackheart\u2019s place? \u201cNo ships for Slaver\u2019s Bay. Westeros is another matter. The east is closed to us, not the sea. The triarchs would be glad to see the back of us, I do not doubt. They might even help us arrange passage back to the Seven Kingdoms. No city wants an army on its doorstep.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d said Lysono Maar.\n\u201cBy now the lion surely has the dragon\u2019s scent,\u201d said one of the Coles, \u201cbut Cersei\u2019s attentions will be fixed upon Meereen and this other queen. She knows nothing of our prince. Once we land and raise our banners, many and more will flock to join us.\u201d\n\u201cSome,\u201d allowed Homeless Harry, \u201cnot many. Rhaegar\u2019s sister has dragons. Rhaegar\u2019s son does not. We do not have the strength to take the realm without Daenerys and her army. Her Unsullied.\u201d\n\u201cThe first Aegon took Westeros without eunuchs,\u201d said Lysono Maar. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t the sixth Aegon do the same?\u201d\n\u201cThe plan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhich plan?\u201d said Tristan Rivers. \u201cThe fat man\u2019s plan? The one that changes every time the moon turns? First Viserys Targaryen was to join us with fifty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. Then the Beggar King was dead, and it was to be the sister, a pliable young child queen who was on her way to Pentos with three new-hatched dragons. Instead the girl turns up on Slaver\u2019s Bay and leaves a string of burning cities in her wake, and the fat man decides we should meet her by Volantis. Now that plan is in ruins as well.\n\u201cI have had enough of Illyrio\u2019s plans. Robert Baratheon won the Iron Throne without the benefit of dragons. We can do the same. And if I am wrong and the realm does not rise for us, we can always retreat back across the narrow sea, as Bittersteel once did, and others after him.\u201d\nStrickland shook his head stubbornly. \u201cThe risk\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is not what it was, now that Tywin Lannister is dead. The Seven Kingdoms will never be more ripe for conquest. Another boy king sits the Iron Throne, this one even younger than the last, and rebels are thick upon the ground as autumn leaves.\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d said Strickland, \u201calone, we cannot hope to\u2014\u201d\nGriff had heard enough of the captain-general\u2019s cowardice. \u201cWe will not be alone. Dorne will join us, must join us. Prince Aegon is Elia\u2019s son as well as Rhaegar\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d the boy said, \u201cand who is there left in Westeros to oppose us? A woman.\u201d\n\u201cA Lannister woman,\u201d insisted the captain-general. \u201cThe bitch will have the Kingslayer at her side, count on that, and they will have all the wealth of Casterly Rock behind them. And Illyrio says this boy king is betrothed to the Tyrell girl, which means we must face the power of Highgarden as well.\u201d\nLaswell Peake rapped his knuckles on the table. \u201cEven after a century, some of us still have friends in the Reach. The power of Highgarden may not be what Mace Tyrell imagines.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Aegon,\u201d said Tristan Rivers, \u201cwe are your men. Is this your wish, that we sail west instead of east?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Aegon replied eagerly. \u201cIf my aunt wants Meereen, she\u2019s welcome to it. I will claim the Iron Throne by myself, with your swords and your allegiance. Move fast and strike hard, and we can win some easy victories before the Lannisters even know that we have landed. That will bring others to our cause.\u201d\nRivers was smiling in approval. Others traded thoughtful looks. Then Peake said, \u201cI would sooner die in Westeros than on the demon road,\u201d and Marq Mandrake chuckled and responded, \u201cMe, I\u2019d sooner live, win lands and some great castle,\u201d and Franklyn Flowers slapped his sword hilt and said, \u201cSo long as I can kill some Fossoways, I\u2019m for it.\u201d\nWhen all of them began to speak at once, Griff knew the tide had turned. This is a side of Aegon I never saw before. It was not the prudent course, but he was tired of prudence, sick of secrets, weary of waiting. Win or lose, he would see Griffin\u2019s Roost again before he died, and be buried in the tomb beside his father\u2019s.\nOne by one, the men of the Golden Company rose, knelt, and laid their swords at the feet of his young prince. The last to do so was Homeless Harry Strickland, blistered feet and all.\nThe sun was reddening the western sky and painting scarlet shadows on the golden skulls atop their spears when they took their leave of the captain-general\u2019s tent. Franklyn Flowers offered to take the prince around the camp and introduce him to some of what he called the lads. Griff gave his consent. \u201cBut remember, so far as the company is concerned, he must remain Young Griff until we cross the narrow sea. In Westeros we\u2019ll wash his hair and let him don his armor.\u201d\n\u201cAye, understood.\u201d Flowers clapped a hand on Young Griff\u2019s back. \u201cWith me. We\u2019ll start with the cooks. Good men to know.\u201d\nWhen they were gone, Griff turned to the Halfmaester. \u201cRide back to the Shy Maid and return with Lady Lemore and Ser Rolly. We\u2019ll need Illyrio\u2019s chests as well. All the coin, and the armor. Give Yandry and Ysilla our thanks. Their part in this is done. They will not be forgotten when His Grace comes into his kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, my lord.\u201d\nGriff left him there, and slipped inside the tent that Homeless Harry had assigned him.\nThe road ahead was full of perils, he knew, but what of it? All men must die. All he asked was time. He had waited so long, surely the gods would grant him a few more years, enough time to see the boy he\u2019d called a son seated on the Iron Throne. To reclaim his lands, his name, his honor. To still the bells that rang so loudly in his dreams whenever he closed his eyes to sleep.\nAlone in the tent, as the gold and scarlet rays of the setting sun shone through the open flap, Jon Connington shrugged off his wolfskin cloak, slipped his mail shirt off over his head, settled on a camp stool, and peeled the glove from his right hand. The nail on his middle finger had turned as black as jet, he saw, and the grey had crept up almost to the first knuckle. The tip of his ring finger had begun to darken too, and when he touched it with the point of his dagger, he felt nothing.\nDeath, he knew, but slow. I still have time. A year. Two years. Five. Some stone men live for ten. Time enough to cross the sea, to see Griffin\u2019s Roost again. To end the Usurper\u2019s line for good and all, and put Rhaegar\u2019s son upon the Iron Throne.\nThen Lord Jon Connington could die content.",

      "content": "THE WINDBLOWN\nThe word passed through the camp like a hot wind. She is coming. Her host is on the march. She is racing south to Yunkai, to put the city to the torch and its people to the sword, and we are going north to meet her.\nFrog had it from Dick Straw who had it from Old Bill Bone who had it from a Pentoshi named Myrio Myrakis, who had a cousin who served as cupbearer to the Tattered Prince. \u201cCoz heard it in the command tent, from Caggo\u2019s own lips,\u201d Dick Straw insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll march before the day is out, see if we don\u2019t.\u201d\nThat much proved true. The command came down from the Tattered Prince through his captains and his serjeants: strike the tents, load the mules, saddle the horses, we march for Yunkai at the break of day. \u201cNot that them Yunkish bastards will be wanting us inside their Yellow City, sniffing round their daughters,\u201d predicted Baqq, the squint-eyed Myrish crossbowman whose name meant Beans. \u201cWe\u2019ll get provisions in Yunkai, maybe fresh horses, then it will be on to Meereen to dance with the dragon queen. So hop quick, Frog, and put a nice edge on your master\u2019s sword. Might be he\u2019ll need it soon.\u201d\nIn Dorne Quentyn Martell had been a prince, in Volantis a merchant\u2019s man, but on the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay he was only Frog, squire to the big bald Dornish knight the sellswords called Greenguts. The men of the Windblown used what names they would, and changed them at a whim. They\u2019d fastened Frog on him because he hopped so fast when the big man shouted a command.\nEven the commander of the Windblown kept his true name to himself. Some free companies had been born during the century of blood and chaos that had followed the Doom of Valyria. Others had been formed yesterday and would be gone upon the morrow. The Windblown went back thirty years, and had known but one commander, the soft-spoken, sad-eyed Pentoshi nobleman called the Tattered Prince. His hair and mail were silver-grey, but his ragged cloak was made of twists of cloth of many colors, blue and grey and purple, red and gold and green, magenta and vermilion and cerulean, all faded by the sun. When the Tattered Prince was three-and-twenty, as Dick Straw told the story, the magisters of Pentos had chosen him to be their new prince, hours after beheading their old prince. Instead he\u2019d buckled on a sword, mounted his favorite horse, and fled to the Disputed Lands, never to return. He had ridden with the Second Sons, the Iron Shields, and the Maiden\u2019s Men, then joined with five brothers-in-arms to form the Windblown. Of those six founders, only he survived.\nFrog had no notion whether any of that was true. Since signing into the Windblown in Volantis, he had seen the Tattered Prince only at a distance. The Dornishmen were new hands, raw recruits, arrow fodder, three amongst two thousand. Their commander kept more elevated company. \u201cI am not a squire,\u201d Quentyn had protested when Gerris Drinkwater\u2014known here as Dornish Gerrold, to distinguish him from Gerrold Redback and Black Gerrold, and sometimes as Drink, since the big man had slipped and called him that\u2014suggested the ruse. \u201cI earned my spurs in Dorne. I am as much a knight as you are.\u201d\nBut Gerris had the right of it; he and Arch were here to protect Quentyn, and that meant keeping him by the big man\u2019s side. \u201cArch is the best fighter of the three of us,\u201d Drinkwater had pointed out, \u201cbut only you can hope to wed the dragon queen.\u201d\nWed her or fight her; either way, I will face her soon. The more Quentyn heard of Daenerys Targaryen, the more he feared that meeting. The Yunkai\u2019i claimed that she fed her dragons on human flesh and bathed in the blood of virgins to keep her skin smooth and supple. Beans laughed at that but relished the tales of the silver queen\u2019s promiscuity. \u201cOne of her captains comes of a line where the men have foot-long members,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut even he\u2019s not big enough for her. She rode with the Dothraki and grew accustomed to being fucked by stallions, so now no man can fill her.\u201d And Books, the clever Volantene swordsman who always seemed to have his nose poked in some crumbly scroll, thought the dragon queen both murderous and mad. \u201cHer khal killed her brother to make her queen. Then she killed her khal to make herself khaleesi. She practices blood sacrifice, lies as easily as she breathes, turns against her own on a whim. She\u2019s broken truces, tortured envoys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0her father was mad too. It runs in the blood.\u201d\nIt runs in the blood. King Aerys II had been mad, all of Westeros knew that. He had exiled two of his Hands and burned a third. If Daenerys is as murdeous as her father, must I still marry her? Prince Doran had never spoken of that possibility.\nFrog would be glad to put Astapor behind him. The Red City was the closest thing to hell he ever hoped to know. The Yunkai\u2019i had sealed the broken gates to keep the dead and dying inside the city, but the sights that he had seen riding down those red brick streets would haunt Quentyn Martell forever. A river choked with corpses. The priestess in her torn robes, impaled upon a stake and attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. Dying men staggering through the streets, bloody and befouled. Children fighting over half-cooked puppies. The last free king of Astapor, screaming naked in the pit as he was set on by a score of starving dogs. And fires, fires everywhere. He could close his eyes and see them still: flames whirling from brick pyramids larger than any castle he had ever seen, plumes of greasy smoke coiling upward like great black snakes.\nWhen the wind blew from the south, the air smelled of smoke even here, three miles from the city. Behind its crumbling red brick walls, Astapor was still asmolder, though by now most of the great fires had burned out. Ashes floated lazy on the breeze like fat grey snowflakes. It would be good to go.\nThe big man agreed. \u201cPast time,\u201d he said, when Frog found him dicing with Beans and Books and Old Bill Bone, and losing yet again. The sellswords loved Greenguts, who bet as fearlessly as he fought, but with far less success. \u201cI\u2019ll want my armor, Frog. Did you scrub that blood off my mail?\u201d\n\u201cAye, ser.\u201d Greenguts\u2019s mail was old and heavy, patched and patched again, much worn. The same was true of his helm, his gorget, greaves, and gauntlets, and the rest of his mismatched plate. Frog\u2019s kit was only slightly better, and Ser Gerris\u2019s was notably worse. Company steel, the armorer had called it. Quentyn had not asked how many other men had worn it before him, how many men had died in it. They had abandoned their own fine armor in Volantis, along with their gold and their true names. Wealthy knights from Houses old in honor did not cross the narrow sea to sell their swords, unless exiled for some infamy. \u201cI\u2019d sooner pose as poor than evil,\u201d Quentyn had declared, when Gerris had explained his ruse to them.\nIt took the Windblown less than an hour to strike their camp. \u201cAnd now we ride,\u201d the Tattered Prince proclaimed from his huge grey warhorse, in a classic High Valyrian that was the closest thing they had to a company tongue. His stallion\u2019s spotted hindquarters were covered with ragged strips of cloth torn from the surcoats of men his master had slain. The prince\u2019s cloak was sewn together from more of the same. An old man he was, past sixty, yet he still sat straight and tall in the high saddle, and his voice was strong enough to carry to every corner of the field. \u201cAstapor was but a taste,\u201d he said, \u201cMeereen will be the feast,\u201d and the sellswords sent up a wild cheer. Streamers of pale blue silk fluttered from their lances, whilst fork-tailed blue-and-white banners flew overhead, the standards of the Windblown.\nThe three Dornishmen cheered with all the rest. Silence would have drawn notice. But as the Windblown rode north along the coast road, close behind Bloodbeard and the Company of the Cat, Frog fell in beside Dornish Gerrold. \u201cSoon,\u201d he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros. There were other Westerosi in the company, but not many, and not near. \u201cWe need to do it soon.\u201d\n\u201cNot here,\u201d warned Gerris, with a mummer\u2019s empty smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak of this tonight, when we make camp.\u201d\nIt was a hundred leagues from Astapor to Yunkai by the old Ghiscari coast road, and another fifty from Yunkai to Meereen. The free companies, well mounted, could reach Yunkai in six days of hard riding, or eight at a more leisurely pace. The legions from Old Ghis would take half again as long, marching afoot, and the Yunkai\u2019i and their slave soldiers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cWith their generals, it\u2019s a wonder they don\u2019t march into the sea,\u201d Beans said.\nThe Yunkai\u2019i did not lack for commanders. An old hero named Yurkhaz zo Yunzak had the supreme command, though the men of the Windblown glimpsed him only at a distance, coming and going in a palanquin so huge it required forty slaves to carry it.\nThey could not help but see his underlings, however. The Yunkish lordlings scuttled everywhere, like roaches. Half of them seemed to be named Ghazdan, Grazdan, Mazdhan, or Ghaznak; telling one Ghiscari name from another was an art few of the Windblown had mastered, so they gave them mocking styles of their own devising.\nForemost amongst them was the Yellow Whale, an obscenely fat man who always wore yellow silk tokars with golden fringes. Too heavy even to stand unassisted, he could not hold his water, so he always smelled of piss, a stench so sharp that even heavy perfumes could not conceal it. But he was said to be the richest man in Yunkai, and he had a passion for grotesques; his slaves included a boy with the legs and hooves of a goat, a bearded woman, a two-headed monster from Mantarys, and a hermaphrodite who warmed his bed at night. \u201cCock and cunny both,\u201d Dick Straw told them. \u201cThe Whale used to own a giant too, liked to watch him fuck his slave girls. Then he died. I hear the Whale\u2019d give a sack o\u2019 gold for a new one.\u201d\nThen there was the Girl General, who rode about on a white horse with a red mane and commanded a hundred strapping slave soldiers that she had bred and trained herself, all of them young, lean, rippling with muscle, and naked but for breechclouts, yellow cloaks, and long bronze shields with erotic inlays. Their mistress could not have been more than sixteen and fancied herself Yunkai\u2019s own Daenerys Targaryen.\nThe Little Pigeon was not quite a dwarf, but he might have passed for one in a bad light. Yet he strutted about as if he were a giant, with his plump little legs spread wide and his plump little chest puffed out. His soldiers were the tallest that any of the Windblown had ever seen; the shortest stood seven feet tall, the tallest close to eight. All were long-faced and long-legged, and the stilts built into the legs of their ornate armor made them longer still. Pink-enameled scales covered their torsos; on their heads were perched elongated helms complete with pointed steel beaks and crests of bobbing pink feathers. Each man wore a long curved sword upon his hip, and each clasped a spear as tall as he was, with a leaf-shaped blade at either end.\n\u201cThe Little Pigeon breeds them,\u201d Dick Straw informed them. \u201cHe buys tall slaves from all over the world, mates the men to the women, and keeps their tallest offspring for the Herons. One day he hopes to be able to dispense with the stilts.\u201d\n\u201cA few sessions on the rack might speed along the process,\u201d suggested the big man.\nGerris Drinkwater laughed. \u201cA fearsome lot. Nothing scares me worse than stilt-walkers in pink scales and feathers. If one was after me, I\u2019d laugh so hard my bladder might let go.\u201d\n\u201cSome say that herons are majestic,\u201d said Old Bill Bone.\n\u201cIf your king eats frogs while standing on one leg.\u201d\n\u201cHerons are craven,\u201d the big man put in. \u201cOne time me and Drink and Cletus were hunting, and we came on these herons wading in the shallows, feasting on tadpoles and small fish. They made a pretty sight, aye, but then a hawk passed overhead, and they all took to the wing like they\u2019d seen a dragon. Kicked up so much wind it blew me off my horse, but Cletus nocked an arrow to his string and brought one down. Tasted like duck, but not so greasy.\u201d\nEven the Little Pigeon and his Herons paled beside the folly of the brothers the sellswords called the Clanker Lords. The last time the slave soldiers of Yunkai\u2019i had faced the dragon queen\u2019s Unsullied, they broke and ran. The Clanker Lords had devised a stratagem to prevent that; they chained their troops together in groups of ten, wrist to wrist and ankle to ankle. \u201cNone of the poor bastards can run unless they all run,\u201d Dick Straw explained, laughing. \u201cAnd if they do all run, they won\u2019t run very fast.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t fucking march very fast either,\u201d observed Beans. \u201cYou can hear them clanking ten leagues off.\u201d\nThere were more, near as mad or worse: Lord Wobblecheeks, the Drunken Conqueror, the Beastmaster, Pudding Face, the Rabbit, the Charioteer, the Perfumed Hero. Some had twenty soldiers, some two hundred or two thousand, all slaves they had trained and equipped themselves. Every one was wealthy, every one was arrogant, and every one was a captain and commander, answerable to no one but Yurkhaz zo Yunzak, disdainful of mere sellswords, and prone to squabbles over precedence that were as endless as they were incomprehensible.\nIn the time it took the Windblown to ride three miles, the Yunkai\u2019i had fallen two-and-a-half miles behind. \u201cA pack of stinking yellow fools,\u201d Beans complained. \u201cThey still ain\u2019t managed to puzzle out why the Stormcrows and the Second Sons went over to the dragon queen.\u201d\n\u201cFor gold, they believe,\u201d said Books. \u201cWhy do you think they\u2019re paying us so well?\u201d\n\u201cGold is sweet, but life is sweeter,\u201d said Beans. \u201cWe were dancing with cripples at Astapor. Do you want to face real Unsullied with that lot on your side?\u201d\n\u201cWe fought the Unsullied at Astapor,\u201d the big man said.\n\u201cI said real Unsullied. Hacking off some boy\u2019s stones with a butcher\u2019s cleaver and handing him a pointy hat don\u2019t make him Unsullied. That dragon queen\u2019s got the real item, the kind that don\u2019t break and run when you fart in their general direction.\u201d\n\u201cThem, and dragons too.\u201d Dick Straw glanced up at the sky as if he thought the mere mention of dragons might be enough to bring them down upon the company. \u201cKeep your swords sharp, boys, we\u2019ll have us a real fight soon.\u201d\nA real fight, thought Frog. The words stuck in his craw. The fight beneath the walls of Astapor had seemed real enough to him, though he knew the sellswords felt otherwise. \u201cThat was butchery, not battle,\u201d the warrior bard Denzo D\u2019han had been heard to declare afterward. Denzo was a captain, and veteran of a hundred battles. Frog\u2019s experience was limited to practice yard and tourney ground, so he did not think it was his place to dispute the verdict of such a seasoned warrior.\nIt seemed like a battle when it first began, though. He remembered how his gut had clenched when he was kicked awake at dawn with the big man looming over him. \u201cInto your armor, slugabed,\u201d he\u2019d boomed. \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s coming out to give us battle. Up, unless you mean to be his meat.\u201d\n\u201cThe Butcher King is dead,\u201d Frog had protested sleepily. That was the story all of them had heard as they scrambled from the ships that had brought them from Old Volantis. A second King Cleon had taken the crown and died in turn, supposedly, and now the Astapori were ruled by a whore and a mad barber whose followers were fighting with each other to control the city.\n\u201cMaybe they lied,\u201d the big man had replied. \u201cOr else this is some other butcher. Might be the first one come back screaming from his tomb to kill some Yunkishmen. Makes no bloody matter, Frog. Get your armor on.\u201d The tent slept ten, and all of them had been on their feet by then, wriggling into breeches and boots, sliding long coats of ringmail down onto their shoulders, buckling breastplates, tightening the straps on greaves or vambraces, grabbing for helms and shields and sword belts. Gerris, quick as ever, was the first one fully clad, Arch close behind him. Together they helped Quentyn don his own harness.\nThree hundred yards away, Astapor\u2019s new Unsullied had been pouring through their gates and forming up in ranks beneath their city\u2019s crumbling red brick walls, dawn light glinting off their spiked bronze helmets and the points of their long spears.\nThe three Dornishmen spilled from the tent together to join the fighters sprinting for the horse lines. Battle. Quentyn had trained with spear and sword and shield since he was old enough to walk, but that meant nothing now. Warrior, make me brave, Frog had prayed, as drums beat in the distance, BOOM boom BOOM boom BOOM boom. The big man pointed out the Butcher King to him, sitting stiff and tall upon an armored horse in a suit of copper scale that flashed brilliantly in the morning sun. He remembered Gerris sidling up just before the fight began. \u201cStay close to Arch, whatever happens. Remember, you\u2019re the only one of us who can get the girl.\u201d By then the Astapori were advancing.\nDead or alive, the Butcher King still took the Wise Masters unawares. The Yunkishmen were still running about in fluttering tokars trying to get their half-trained slave soldiers into some semblance of order as Unsullied spears came crashing through their siege lines. If not for their allies and their despised hirelings they might well have been overwhelmed, but the Windblown and the Company of the Cat were ahorse in minutes and came thundering down on the Astapori flanks even as a legion from New Ghis pushed through the Yunkish camp from the other side and met the Unsullied spear to spear and shield to shield.\nThe rest was butchery, but this time it was the Butcher King on the wrong end of the cleaver. Caggo was the one who finally cut him down, fighting through the king\u2019s protectors on his monstrous warhorse and opening Cleon the Great from shoulder to hip with one blow of his curved Valyrian arakh. Frog did not see it, but those who did claimed Cleon\u2019s copper armor rent like silk, and from within came an awful stench and a hundred wriggling grave worms. Cleon had been dead after all. The desperate Astapori had pulled him from his tomb, clapped him into armor, and tied him onto a horse in hopes of giving heart to their Unsullied.\nDead Cleon\u2019s fall wrote an end to that. The new Unsullied threw down their spears and shields and ran, only to find the gates of Astapor shut behind them. Frog had done his part in the slaughter that followed, riding down the frightened eunuchs with the other Windblown. Hard by the big man\u2019s hip he rode, slashing right and left as their wedge went through the Unsullied like a spearpoint. When they burst through on the other side, the Tattered Prince had wheeled them round and led them through again. It was only coming back that Frog got a good look at the faces beneath the spiked bronze caps and realized that most were no older than he. Green boys screaming for their mothers, he\u2019d thought, but he killed them all the same. By the time he\u2019d left the field, his sword was running red with blood and his arm was so tired he could hardly lift it.\nYet that was no real fight, he thought. The real fight will be on us soon, and we must be away before it comes, or we\u2019ll find ourselves fighting on the wrong side.\nThat night the Windblown made camp beside the shore of Slaver\u2019s Bay. Frog drew the first watch and was sent to guard the horse lines. Gerris met him there just after sundown, as a half-moon shone upon the waters.\n\u201cThe big man should be here as well,\u201d said Quentyn.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone to look up Old Bill Bone and lose the rest of his silver,\u201d Gerris said. \u201cLeave him out of this. He\u2019ll do as we say, though he won\u2019t like it much.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d There was much and more about this Quentyn did not like himself. Sailing on an overcrowded ship tossed by wind and sea, eating hard-bread crawling with weevils and drinking black tar rum to sweet oblivion, sleeping on piles of moldy straw with the stench of strangers in his nostrils\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all that he had expected when he made his mark on that scrap of parchment in Volantis, pledging the Tattered Prince his sword and service for a year. Those were hardships to be endured, the stuff of all adventures.\nBut what must come next was plain betrayal. The Yunkai\u2019i had brought them from Old Volantis to fight for the Yellow City, but now the Dornishmen meant to turn their cloaks and go over to the other side. That meant abandoning their new brothers-in-arms as well. The Windblown were not the sort of companions Quentyn would have chosen, but he had crossed the sea with them, shared their meat and mead, fought beside them, traded tales with those few whose talk he understood. And if all his tales were lies, well, that was the cost of passage to Meereen.\nIt is not what you\u2019d call honorable, Gerris had warned them, back at the Merchant\u2019s House.\n\u201cDaenerys may be halfway to Yunkai by now, with an army at her back,\u201d Quentyn said as they walked amongst the horses.\n\u201cShe may be,\u201d Gerris said, \u201cbut she\u2019s not. We\u2019ve heard such talk before. The Astapori were convinced Daenerys was coming south with her dragons to break the siege. She didn\u2019t come then, and she\u2019s not coming now.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t know that, not for certain. We need to steal away before we end up fighting the woman I was sent to woo.\u201d\n\u201cWait till Yunkai.\u201d Gerris gestured at the hills. \u201cThese lands belong to the Yunkai\u2019i. No one is like to want to feed or shelter three deserters. North of Yunkai, that\u2019s no-man\u2019s-land.\u201d\nHe was not wrong. Even so, Quentyn felt uneasy. \u201cThe big man\u2019s made too many friends. He knows the plan was always to steal off and make our way to Daenerys, but he\u2019s not going to feel good about abandoning men he\u2019s fought with. If we wait too long, it\u2019s going to feel as if we\u2019re deserting them on the eve of battle. He will never do that. You know him as well as I do.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s desertion whenever we do it,\u201d argued Gerris, \u201cand the Tattered Prince takes a dim view of deserters. He\u2019ll send hunters after us, and Seven save us if they catch us. If we\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll just chop off a foot to make sure we never run again. If we\u2019re unlucky, they\u2019ll give us to Pretty Meris.\u201d\nThat last gave Quentyn pause. Pretty Meris frightened him. A Westerosi woman, but taller than he was, just a thumb under six feet. After twenty years amongst the free companies, there was nothing pretty about her, inside or out.\nGerris took him by the arm. \u201cWait. A few more days, that\u2019s all. We have crossed half the world, be patient for a few more leagues. Somewhere north of Yunkai our chance will come.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say,\u201d said Frog doubtfully\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but for once the gods were listening, and their chance came much sooner than that.\nIt was two days later. Hugh Hungerford reined up by their cookfire, and said, \u201cDornish. You\u2019re wanted in the command tent.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one of us?\u201d asked Gerris. \u201cWe\u2019re all Dornish.\u201d\n\u201cAll of you, then.\u201d Sour and saturnine, with a maimed hand, Hungerford had been company paymaster for a time, until the Tattered Prince had caught him stealing from the coffers and removed three of his fingers. Now he was just a serjeant.\nWhat could this be? Up to now, Frog had no notion that their commander knew he was alive. Hungerford had already ridden off, however, so there was no time for questions. All they could do was gather up the big man and report as ordered. \u201cAdmit to nothing and be prepared to fight,\u201d Quentyn told his friends.\n\u201cI am always prepared to fight,\u201d said the big man.\nThe great grey sailcloth pavilion that the Tattered Prince liked to call his canvas castle was crowded when the Dornishmen arrived. It took Quentyn only a moment to realize that most of those assembled were from the Seven Kingdoms, or boasted Westerosi blood. Exiles or the sons of exiles. Dick Straw claimed there were three score Westerosi in the company; a good third of those were here, including Dick himself, Hugh Hungerford, Pretty Meris, and golden-haired Lewis Lanster, the company\u2019s best archer.\nDenzo D\u2019han was there as well, with Caggo huge beside him. Caggo Corpsekiller the men were calling him now, though not to his face; he was quick to anger, and that curved black sword of his was as nasty as its owner. There were hundreds of Valyrian longswords in the world, but only a handful of Valyrian arakhs. Neither Caggo nor D\u2019han was Westerosi, but both were captains and stood high in the Tattered Prince\u2019s regard. His right arm and his left. Something major is afoot.\nIt was the Tattered Prince himself who did the speaking. \u201cOrders have come down from Yurkhaz,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Astapori still survive have come creeping from their hidey-holes, it seems. There\u2019s nothing left in Astapor but corpses, so they\u2019re pouring out into the countryside, hundreds of them, maybe thousands, all starved and sick. The Yunkai\u2019i don\u2019t want them near their Yellow City. We\u2019ve been commanded to hunt them down and turn them, drive them back to Astapor or north to Meereen. If the dragon queen wants to take them in, she\u2019s welcome to them. Half of them have the bloody flux, and even the healthy ones are mouths to feed.\u201d\n\u201cYunkai is closer than Meereen,\u201d Hugh Hungerford objected. \u201cWhat if they won\u2019t turn, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have swords and lances, Hugh. Though bows might serve you better. Stay well away from those who show signs of the flux. I\u2019m sending half our strength into the hills. Fifty patrols, twenty riders each. Bloodbeard\u2019s got the same orders, so the Cats will be in the field as well.\u201d\nA look passed between the men, and a few muttered under their breath. Though the Windblown and the Company of the Cat were both under contract to Yunkai, a year ago in the Disputed Lands they had been on opposite sides of the battle lines, and bad blood still lingered. Bloodbeard, the savage commander of the Cats, was a roaring giant with a ferocious appetite for slaughter who made no secret of his disdain for \u201cold greybeards in rags.\u201d\nDick Straw cleared his throat. \u201cBegging your pardon, but we\u2019re all Seven Kingdoms born here. M\u2019lord never broke up the company by blood or tongue before. Why send us lot together?\u201d\n\u201cA fair question. You\u2019re to ride east, deep into the hills, then swing wide about Yunkai, making for Meereen. Should you come on any Astapori, drive them north or kill them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but know that is not the purpose of your mission. Beyond the Yellow City, you\u2019re like to come up against the dragon queen\u2019s patrols. Second Sons or Stormcrows. Either will serve. Go over to them.\u201d\n\u201cGo over to them?\u201d said the bastard knight, Ser Orson Stone. \u201cYou\u2019d have us turn our cloaks?\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d said the Tattered Prince.\nQuentyn Martell almost laughed aloud. The gods are mad.\nThe Westerosi shifted uneasily. Some stared into their wine cups, as if they hoped to find some wisdom there. Hugh Hungerford frowned. \u201cYou think Queen Daenerys will take us in\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0but if she does, what then? Are we spies? Assassins? Envoys? Are you thinking to change sides?\u201d\nCaggo scowled. \u201cThat is for the prince to decide, Hungerford. Your part is to do as you are told.\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d Hungerford raised his two-fingered hand.\n\u201cLet us be frank,\u201d said Denzo D\u2019han, the warrior bard. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i do not inspire confidence. Whatever the outcome of this war, the Windblown should share in the spoils of victory. Our prince is wise to keep all roads open.\u201d\n\u201cMeris will command you,\u201d said the Tattered Prince. \u201cShe knows my mind in this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and Daenerys Targaryen may be more accepting of another woman.\u201d\nQuentyn glanced back to Pretty Meris. When her cold dead eyes met his, he felt a shiver. I do not like this.\nDick Straw still had doubts as well. \u201cThe girl would be a fool to trust us. Even with Meris. Especially with Meris. Hell, I don\u2019t trust Meris, and I\u2019ve fucked her a few times.\u201d He grinned, but no one laughed. Least of all Pretty Meris.\n\u201cI think you are mistaken, Dick,\u201d the Tattered Prince said. \u201cYou are all Westerosi. Friends from home. You speak her same tongue, worship her same gods. As for motive, all of you have suffered wrongs at my hands. Dick, I\u2019ve whipped you more than any man in the company, and you have the back to prove it. Hugh lost three fingers to my discipline. Meris was raped half round the company. Not this company, true, but we need not mention that. Will of the Woods, well, you\u2019re just filth. Ser Orson blames me for dispatching his brother to the Sorrows and Ser Lucifer is still seething about that slave girl Caggo took from him.\u201d\n\u201cHe could have given her back when he\u2019d had her,\u201d Lucifer Long complained. \u201cHe had no cause to kill her.\u201d\n\u201cShe was ugly,\u201d said Caggo. \u201cThat\u2019s cause enough.\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince went on as if no one had spoken. \u201cWebber, you nurse claims to lands lost in Westeros. Lanster, I killed that boy you were so fond of. You Dornish three, you think we lied to you. The plunder from Astapor was much less than you were promised in Volantis, and I took the lion\u2019s share of it.\u201d\n\u201cThe last part\u2019s true,\u201d Ser Orson said.\n\u201cThe best ruses always have some seed of truth,\u201d said the Tattered Prince. \u201cEvery one of you has ample reason for wanting to abandon me. And Daenerys Targaryen knows that sellswords are a fickle lot. Her own Second Sons and Stormcrows took Yunkish gold but did not hesitate to join her when the tide of battle began to flow her way.\u201d\n\u201cWhen should we leave?\u201d asked Lewis Lanster.\n\u201cAt once. Be wary of the Cats and any Long Lances you may encounter. No one will know your defection is a ruse but those of us in this tent. Turn your tiles too soon, and you will be maimed as deserters or disemboweled as turncloaks.\u201d\nThe three Dornishmen were silent as they left the command tent. Twenty riders, all speaking the Common Tongue, thought Quentyn. Whispering has just gotten a deal more dangerous.\nThe big man slapped him hard across the back. \u201cSo. This is sweet, Frog. A dragon hunt.\u201d",

      "content": "THE WAYWARD BRIDE\nAsha Greyjoy was seated in Galbart Glover\u2019s longhall drinking Galbart Glover\u2019s wine when Galbart Glover\u2019s maester brought the letter to her.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d The maester\u2019s voice was anxious, as it always was when he spoke to her. \u201cA bird from Barrowton.\u201d He thrust the parchment at her as if he could not wait to be rid of it. It was tightly rolled and sealed with a button of hard pink wax.\nBarrowton. Asha tried to recall who ruled in Barrowton. Some northern lord, no friend of mine. And that seal\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the Boltons of the Dreadfort went into battle beneath pink banners spattered with little drops of blood. It only stood to reason that they would use pink sealing wax as well.\nThis is poison that I hold, she thought. I ought to burn it. Instead she cracked the seal. A scrap of leather fluttered down into her lap. When she read the dry brown words, her black mood grew blacker still. Dark wings, dark words. The ravens never brought glad tidings. The last message sent to Deepwood had been from Stannis Baratheon, demanding homage. This was worse. \u201cThe northmen have taken Moat Cailin.\u201d\n\u201cThe Bastard of Bolton?\u201d asked Qarl, beside her.\n\u201cRamsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell, he signs himself. But there are other names as well.\u201d Lady Dustin, Lady Cerwyn, and four Ryswells had appended their own signatures beneath his. Beside them was drawn a crude giant, the mark of some Umber.\nThose were done in maester\u2019s ink, made of soot and coal tar, but the message above was scrawled in brown in a huge, spiky hand. It spoke of the fall of Moat Cailin, of the triumphant return of the Warden of the North to his domains, of a marriage soon to be made. The first words were, \u201cI write this letter in the blood of ironmen,\u201d the last, \u201cI send you each a piece of prince. Linger in my lands, and share his fate.\u201d\nAsha had believed her little brother dead. Better dead than this. The scrap of skin had fallen into her lap. She held it to the candle and watched the smoke curl up, until the last of it had been consumed and the flame was licking at her fingers.\nGalbart Glover\u2019s maester hovered expectantly at her elbow. \u201cThere will be no answer,\u201d she informed him.\n\u201cMay I share these tidings with Lady Sybelle?\u201d\n\u201cIf it please you.\u201d Whether Sybelle Glover would find any joy in the fall of Moat Cailin, Asha could not say. Lady Sybelle all but lived in her godswood, praying for her children and her husband\u2019s safe return. Another prayer like to go unanswered. Her heart tree is as deaf and blind as our Drowned God. Robett Glover and his brother Galbart had ridden south with the Young Wolf. If the tales they had heard of the Red Wedding were even half-true, they were not like to ride north again. Her children are alive, at least, and that is thanks to me. Asha had left them at Ten Towers in the care of her aunts. Lady Sybelle\u2019s infant daughter was still on the breast, and she had judged the girl too delicate to expose to the rigors of another stormy crossing. Asha shoved the letter into the maester\u2019s hands. \u201cHere. Let her find some solace here if she can. You have my leave to go.\u201d\nThe maester inclined his head and departed. After he was gone, Tris Botley turned to Asha. \u201cIf Moat Cailin has fallen, Torrhen\u2019s Square will soon follow. Then it will be our turn.\u201d\n\u201cNot for a while yet. The Cleftjaw will make them bleed.\u201d Torrhen\u2019s Square was not a ruin like Moat Cailin, and Dagmer was iron to the bone. He would die before he\u2019d yield.\nIf my father still lived, Moat Cailin would never have fallen. Balon Greyjoy had known that the Moat was the key to holding the north. Euron knew that as well; he simply did not care. No more than he cared what happened to Deepwood Motte or Torrhen\u2019s Square. \u201cEuron has no interest in Balon\u2019s conquests. My nuncle\u2019s off chasing dragons.\u201d The Crow\u2019s Eye had summoned all the strength of the Iron Isles to Old Wyk and sailed out into the deepness of the Sunset Sea, with his brother Victarion following behind like a whipped cur. There was no one left on Pyke to appeal to, save for her own lord husband. \u201cWe stand alone.\u201d\n\u201cDagmer will smash them,\u201d insisted Cromm, who had never met a woman he loved half so much as battle. \u201cThey are only wolves.\u201d\n\u201cThe wolves are all slain.\u201d Asha picked at the pink wax with her thumbnail. \u201cThese are the skinners who slew them.\u201d\n\u201cWe should go to Torrhen\u2019s Square and join the fight,\u201d urged Quenton Greyjoy, a distant cousin and captain of the Salty Wench.\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Dagon Greyjoy, a cousin still more distant. Dagon the Drunkard, men called him, but drunk or sober he loved to fight. \u201cWhy should the Cleftjaw have all the glory for himself?\u201d\nTwo of Galbart Glover\u2019s serving men brought forth the roast, but that strip of skin had taken Asha\u2019s appetite. My men have given up all hope of victory, she realized glumly. All they look for now is a good death. The wolves would give them that, she had no doubt. Soon or late, they will come to take this castle back.\nThe sun was sinking behind the tall pines of the wolfswood as Asha climbed the wooden steps to the bedchamber that had once been Galbart Glover\u2019s. She had drunk too much wine and her head was pounding. Asha Greyjoy loved her men, captains and crew alike, but half of them were fools. Brave fools, but fools nonetheless. Go to the Cleftjaw, yes, as if we could\u00a0\u2026\nBetween Deepwood and Dagmer lay long leagues, rugged hills, thick woods, wild rivers, and more northmen than she cared to contemplate. Asha had four longships and not quite two hundred men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0including Tristifer Botley, who could not be relied on. For all his talk of love, she could not imagine Tris rushing off to Torrhen\u2019s Square to die with Dagmer Cleftjaw.\nQarl followed her up to Galbart Glover\u2019s bedchamber. \u201cGet out,\u201d she told him. \u201cI want to be alone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you want is me.\u201d He tried to kiss her.\nAsha pushed him away. \u201cTouch me again and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He drew his dagger. \u201cUndress yourself, girl.\u201d\n\u201cFuck yourself, you beardless boy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner fuck you.\u201d One quick slash unlaced her jerkin. Asha reached for her axe, but Qarl dropped his knife and caught her wrist, twisting back her arm until the weapon fell from her fingers. He pushed her back onto Glover\u2019s bed, kissed her hard, and tore off her tunic to let her breasts spill out. When she tried to knee him in the groin, he twisted away and forced her legs apart with his knees. \u201cI\u2019ll have you now.\u201d\n\u201cDo it,\u201d she spat, \u201cand I\u2019ll kill you in your sleep.\u201d\nShe was sopping wet when he entered her. \u201cDamn you,\u201d she said. \u201cDamn you damn you damn you.\u201d He sucked her nipples till she cried out half in pain and half in pleasure. Her cunt became the world. She forgot Moat Cailin and Ramsay Bolton and his little piece of skin, forgot the kingsmoot, forgot her failure, forgot her exile and her enemies and her husband. Only his hands mattered, only his mouth, only his arms around her, his cock inside her. He fucked her till she screamed, and then again until she wept, before he finally spent his seed inside her womb.\n\u201cI am a woman wed,\u201d she reminded him, afterward. \u201cYou\u2019ve despoiled me, you beardless boy. My lord husband will cut your balls off and put you in a dress.\u201d\nQarl rolled off her. \u201cIf he can get out of his chair.\u201d\nThe room was cold. Asha rose from Galbart Glover\u2019s bed and took off her torn clothes. The jerkin would need fresh laces, but her tunic was ruined. I never liked it anyway. She tossed it on the flames. The rest she left in a puddle by the bed. Her breasts were sore, and Qarl\u2019s seed was trickling down her thigh. She would need to brew some moon tea or risk bringing another kraken into the world. What does it matter? My father\u2019s dead, my mother\u2019s dying, my brother\u2019s being flayed, and there\u2019s naught that I can do about any of it. And I\u2019m married. Wedded and bedded\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though not by the same man.\nWhen she slipped back beneath the furs, Qarl was asleep. \u201cNow your life is mine. Where did I put my dagger?\u201d Asha pressed herself against his back and slid her arms about him. On the isles he was known as Qarl the Maid, in part to distinguish him from Qarl Shepherd, Queer Qarl Kenning, Qarl Quickaxe, and Qarl the Thrall, but more for his smooth cheeks. When Asha had first met him, Qarl had been trying to raise a beard. \u201cPeach fuzz,\u201d she had called it, laughing. Qarl confessed that he had never seen a peach, so she told him he must join her on her next voyage south.\nIt had still been summer then; Robert sat the Iron Throne, Balon brooded on the Seastone Chair, and the Seven Kingdoms were at peace. Asha sailed the Black Wind down the coast, trading. They called at Fair Isle and Lannisport and a score of smaller ports before reaching the Arbor, where the peaches were always huge and sweet. \u201cYou see,\u201d she\u2019d said, the first time she\u2019d held one up against Qarl\u2019s cheek. When she made him try a bite, the juice ran down his chin, and she had to kiss it clean.\nThat night they\u2019d spent devouring peaches and each other, and by the time daylight returned Asha was sated and sticky and as happy as she\u2019d ever been. Was that six years ago, or seven? Summer was a fading memory, and it had been three years since Asha last enjoyed a peach. She still enjoyed Qarl, though. The captains and the kings might not have wanted her, but he did.\nAsha had known other lovers; some shared her bed for half a year, some for half a night. Qarl pleased her more than all the rest together. He might shave but once a fortnight, but a shaggy beard does not make a man. She liked the feel of his smooth, soft skin beneath her fingers. She liked the way his long, straight hair brushed against his shoulders. She liked the way he kissed. She liked how he grinned when she brushed her thumbs across his nipples. The hair between his legs was a darker shade of sand than the hair on his head, but fine as down compared to the coarse black bush around her own sex. She liked that too. He had a swimmer\u2019s body, long and lean, with not a scar upon him.\nA shy smile, strong arms, clever fingers, and two sure swords. What more could any woman want? She would have married Qarl, and gladly, but she was Lord Balon\u2019s daughter and he was common-born, the grandson of a thrall. Too lowborn for me to wed, but not too low for me to suck his cock. Drunk, smiling, she crawled beneath the furs and took him in her mouth. Qarl stirred in his sleep, and after a moment he began to stiffen. By the time she had him hard again, he was awake and she was wet. Asha draped the furs across her bare shoulders and mounted him, drawing him so deep inside her that she could not tell who had the cock and who the cunt. This time the two of them reached their peak together.\n\u201cMy sweet lady,\u201d he murmured after, in a voice still thick with sleep. \u201cMy sweet queen.\u201d\nNo, Asha thought, I am no queen, nor shall I ever be. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d She kissed his cheek, padded across Galbart Glover\u2019s bedchamber, and threw the shutters open. The moon was almost full, the night so clear that she could see the mountains, their peaks crowned with snow. Cold and bleak and inhospitable, but beautiful in the moonlight. Their summits glimmered pale and jagged as a row of sharpened teeth. The foothills and the smaller peaks were lost in shadow.\nThe sea was closer, only five leagues north, but Asha could not see it. Too many hills stood in the way. And trees, so many trees. The wolfswood, the northmen named the forest. Most nights you could hear the wolves, calling to each other through the dark. An ocean of leaves. Would it were an ocean of water.\nDeepwood might be closer to the sea than Winterfell, but it was still too far for her taste. The air smelled of pines instead of salt. Northeast of those grim grey mountains stood the Wall, where Stannis Baratheon had raised his standards. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, men said, but the other side of that coin was, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. The ironborn were the enemies of the northern lords this Baratheon pretender needed desperately. I could offer him my fair young body, she thought, pushing a strand of hair from her eyes, but Stannis was wed and so was she, and he and the ironborn were old foes. During her father\u2019s first rebellion, Stannis had smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle and subdued Great Wyk in his brother\u2019s name.\nDeepwood\u2019s mossy walls enclosed a wide, rounded hill with a flattened top, crowned by a cavernous longhall with a watchtower at one end, rising fifty feet above the hill. Beneath the hill was the bailey, with its stables, paddock, smithy, well, and sheepfold, defended by a deep ditch, a sloping earthen dike, and a palisade of logs. The outer defenses made an oval, following the contours of the land. There were two gates, each protected by a pair of square wooden towers, and wallwalks around the perimeter. On the south side of the castle, moss grew thick upon the palisade and crept halfway up the towers. To east and west were empty fields. Oats and barley had been growing there when Asha took the castle, only to be crushed underfoot during her attack. A series of hard frosts had killed the crops they\u2019d planted afterward, leaving only mud and ash and wilted, rotting stalks.\nIt was an old castle, but not a strong one. She had taken it from the Glovers, and the Bastard of Bolton would take it from her. He would not flay her, though. Asha Greyjoy did not intend to be taken alive. She would die as she had lived, with an axe in her hand and a laugh upon her lips.\nHer lord father had given her thirty longships to capture Deepwood. Four remained, counting her own Black Wind, and one of those belonged to Tris Botley, who had joined her when all her other men were fleeing. No. That is not just. They sailed home to do homage to their king. If anyone fled, it was me. The memory still shamed her.\n\u201cGo,\u201d the Reader had urged, as the captains were bearing her uncle Euron down Nagga\u2019s hill to don his driftwood crown.\n\u201cSaid the raven to the crow. Come with me. I need you to raise the men of Harlaw.\u201d Back then, she\u2019d meant to fight.\n\u201cThe men of Harlaw are here. The ones who count. Some were shouting Euron\u2019s name. I will not set Harlaw against Harlaw.\u201d\n\u201cEuron\u2019s mad. And dangerous. That hellhorn\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI heard it. Go, Asha. Once Euron has been crowned, he\u2019ll look for you. You dare not let his eye fall upon you.\u201d\n\u201cIf I stand with my other uncles\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0you will die outcast, with every hand against you. When you put your name before the captains you submitted yourself to their judgment. You cannot go against that judgment now. Only once has the choice of a kingsmoot been overthrown. Read Haereg.\u201d\nOnly Rodrik the Reader would talk of some old book whilst their lives were balanced on a sword\u2019s edge. \u201cIf you are staying, so am I,\u201d she told him stubbornly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Euron shows the world his smiling eye tonight, but come the morrow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Asha, you are Balon\u2019s daughter, and your claim is stronger than his own. So long as you draw breath you remain a danger to him. If you stay, you will be killed or wed to the Red Oarsman. I don\u2019t know which would be worse. Go. You will not have another chance.\u201d\nAsha had landed Black Wind on the far side of the island for just such an eventuality. Old Wyk was not large. She could be back aboard her ship before the sun came up, on her way to Harlaw before Euron realized she was missing. Yet she hesitated until her uncle said, \u201cDo it for the love you bear me, child. Do not make me watch you die.\u201d\nSo she went. To Ten Towers first, to bid farewell to her mother. \u201cIt may be a long while before I come again,\u201d Asha warned her. Lady Alannys had not understood. \u201cWhere is Theon?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere is my baby boy?\u201d Lady Gwynesse only wanted to know when Lord Rodrik would return. \u201cI am seven years his elder. Ten Towers should be mine.\u201d\nAsha was still at Ten Towers taking on provisions when the tidings of her marriage reached her. \u201cMy wayward niece needs taming,\u201d the Crow\u2019s Eye was reported to have said, \u201cand I know the man to tame her.\u201d He had married her to Erik Ironmaker and named the Anvil-Breaker to rule the Iron Islands whilst he was chasing dragons. Erik had been a great man in his day, a fearless reaver who could boast of having sailed with her grandsire\u2019s grandsire, that same Dagon Greyjoy whom Dagon the Drunkard had been named for. Old women on Fair Isle still frightened their grandchildren with tales of Lord Dagon and his men. I wounded Eric\u2019s pride at the kingsmoot, Asha reflected. He is not like to forget that.\nShe had to pay her nuncle his just due. With one stroke, Euron had turned a rival into a supporter, secured the isles in his absence, and removed Asha as a threat. And enjoyed a good belly laugh too. Tris Botley said that the Crow\u2019s Eye had used a seal to stand in for her at her wedding. \u201cI hope Erik did not insist on a consummation,\u201d she\u2019d said.\nI cannot go home, she thought, but I dare not stay here much longer. The quiet of the woods unnerved her. Asha had spent her life on islands and on ships. The sea was never silent. The sound of the waves washing against a rocky shore was in her blood, but there were no waves at Deepwood Motte\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only the trees, the endless trees, soldier pines and sentinels, beech and ash and ancient oaks, chestnut trees and ironwoods and firs. The sound they made was softer than the sea, and she heard it only when the wind was blowing; then the sighing seemed to come from all around her, as if the trees were whispering to one another in some language that she could not understand.\nTonight the whispering seemed louder than before. A rush of dead brown leaves, Asha told herself, bare branches creaking in the wind. She turned away from the window, away from the woods. I need a deck beneath my feet again. Or failing that, some food in my belly. She\u2019d had too much wine tonight, but too little bread and none of that great bloody roast.\nThe moonlight was bright enough to find her clothes. She donned thick black breeches, a quilted tunic, and a green leather jerkin covered with overlapping plates of steel. Leaving Qarl to his dreams, she padded down the keep\u2019s exterior stair, the steps creaking under her bare feet. One of the men walking sentry on the walls spied her making her descent and lifted his spear to her. Asha whistled back at him. As she crossed the inner yard to the kitchens, Galbart Glover\u2019s dogs began to bark. Good, she thought. That will drown out the sound of the trees.\nShe was cutting a wedge of yellow cheese from a round as big as a cart wheel when Tris Botley stepped into the kitchen, bundled up in a thick fur cloak. \u201cMy queen.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mock me.\u201d\n\u201cYou will always rule my heart. No amount of fools shouting at a kingsmoot can change that.\u201d\nWhat am I to do with this boy? Asha could not doubt his devotion. Not only had he stood her champion on Nagga\u2019s hill and shouted out her name, but he had even crossed the sea to join her afterward, abandoning his king and kin and home. Not that he dared defy Euron to his face. When the Crow\u2019s Eye took the fleet to sea Tris had simply lagged behind, changing course only when the other ships were lost to sight. Even that took a certain courage, though; he could never return to the isles. \u201cCheese?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThere\u2019s ham as well, and mustard.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not food I want, my lady. You know that.\u201d Tris had grown himself a thick brown beard at Deepwood. He claimed it helped to keep his face warm. \u201cI saw you from the watchtower.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have the watch, what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cCromm\u2019s up there, and Hagen the Horn. How many eyes do we need to watch leaves rustle in the moonlight? We need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou know Hagen\u2019s daughter, the one with the red hair. She steers a ship as well as any man and has a pretty face. Seventeen, and I\u2019ve seen her looking at you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Hagen\u2019s daughter.\u201d He almost touched her before thinking better of it. \u201cAsha, it is time to go. Moat Cailin was the only thing holding back the tide. If we remain here, the northmen will kill us all, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cWould you have me run?\u201d\n\u201cI would have you live. I love you.\u201d\nNo, she thought, you love some innocent maiden who lives only in your head, a frightened child in need of your protection. \u201cI do not love you,\u201d she said bluntly, \u201cand I do not run.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s here that you should hold so tight to it but pine and mud and foes? We have our ships. Sail away with me, and we\u2019ll make new lives upon the sea.\u201d\n\u201cAs pirates?\u201d It was almost tempting. Let the wolves have back their gloomy woods and retake the open sea.\n\u201cAs traders,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll voyage east as the Crow\u2019s Eye did, but we\u2019ll come back with silks and spices instead of a dragon\u2019s horn. One voyage to the Jade Sea and we\u2019ll be as rich as gods. We can have a manse in Oldtown or one of the Free Cities.\u201d\n\u201cYou and me and Qarl?\u201d She saw him flinch at the mention of Qarl\u2019s name. \u201cHagen\u2019s girl might like to sail the Jade Sea with you. I am still the kraken\u2019s daughter. My place is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014where? You cannot return to the isles. Not unless you mean to submit to your lord husband.\u201d\nAsha tried to picture herself abed with Erik Ironmaker, crushed beneath his bulk, suffering his embraces. Better him than the Red Oarsman or Left-Hand Lucas Codd. The Anvil-Breaker had once been a roaring giant, fearsomely strong, fiercely loyal, utterly without fear. It might not be so bad. He\u2019s like to die the first time he tries to do his duty as a husband. That would make her Erik\u2019s widow instead of Erik\u2019s wife, which could be better or a good deal worse, depending on his grandsons. And my nuncle. In the end, all the winds blow me back toward Euron. \u201cI have hostages, on Harlaw,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd there is still Sea Dragon Point\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if I cannot have my father\u2019s kingdom, why not make one of my own?\u201d Sea Dragon Point had not always been as thinly peopled as it was now. Old ruins could still be found amongst its hills and bogs, the remains of ancient strongholds of the First Men. In the high places, there were weirwood circles left by the children of the forest.\n\u201cYou are clinging to Sea Dragon Point the way a drowning man clings to a bit of wreckage. What does Sea Dragon have that anyone could ever want? There are no mines, no gold, no silver, not even tin or iron. The land is too wet for wheat or corn.\u201d\nI do not plan on planting wheat or corn. \u201cWhat\u2019s there? I\u2019ll tell you. Two long coastlines, a hundred hidden coves, otters in the lakes, salmon in the rivers, clams along the shore, colonies of seals offshore, tall pines for building ships.\u201d\n\u201cWho will build these ships, my queen? Where will Your Grace find subjects for her kingdom if the northmen let you have it? Or do you mean to rule over a realm of seals and otters?\u201d\nShe gave a rueful laugh. \u201cOtters might be easier to rule than men, I grant you. And seals are smarter. No, you may be right. My best course may still be to return to Pyke. There are those on Harlaw who would welcome my return. On Pyke as well. And Euron won no friends on Blacktyde when he slew Lord Baelor. I could find my nuncle Aeron, raise the isles.\u201d No one had seen the Damphair since the kingsmoot, but his Drowned Men claimed he was hiding on Great Wyk and would soon come forth to call down the wroth of the Drowned God on the Crow\u2019s Eye and his minions.\n\u201cThe Anvil-Breaker is searching for the Damphair too. He is hunting down the Drowned Men. Blind Beron Blacktyde was taken and put to the question. Even the Old Grey Gull was given shackles. How will you find the priest when all of Euron\u2019s men cannot?\u201d\n\u201cHe is my blood. My father\u2019s brother.\u201d It was a feeble answer, and Asha knew it.\n\u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d\n\u201cI am about to, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cI think the Damphair\u2019s dead. I think the Crow\u2019s Eye slit his throat for him. Ironmaker\u2019s search is just to make us believe the priest escaped. Euron is afraid to be seen as a kinslayer.\u201d\n\u201cNever let my nuncle hear you say that. Tell the Crow\u2019s Eye he\u2019s afraid of kinslaying, and he\u2019ll murder one of his own sons just to prove you wrong.\u201d Asha was feeling almost sober by then. Tristifer Botley had that effect on her.\n\u201cEven if you did find your uncle Damphair, the two of you would fail. You were both part of the kingsmoot, so you cannot say it was unlawful called, as Torgon did. You are bound to its decision by all the laws of gods and men. You\u2014\u201d\nAsha frowned. \u201cWait. Torgon? Which Torgon?\u201d\n\u201cTorgon the Latecomer.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a king during the Age of Heroes.\u201d She recalled that much about him, but little else. \u201cWhat of him?\u201d\n\u201cTorgon Greyiron was the king\u2019s eldest son. But the king was old and Torgon restless, so it happened that when his father died he was raiding along the Mander from his stronghold on Greyshield. His brothers sent no word to him but instead quickly called a kingsmoot, thinking that one of them would be chosen to wear the driftwood crown. But the captains and the kings chose Urragon Goodbrother to rule instead. The first thing the new king did was command that all the sons of the old king be put to death, and so they were. After that men called him Badbrother, though in truth they\u2019d been no kin of his. He ruled for almost two years.\u201d\nAsha remembered now. \u201cTorgon came home\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0and said the kingsmoot was unlawful since he had not been there to make his claim. Badbrother had proved to be as mean as he was cruel and had few friends left upon the isles. The priests denounced him, the lords rose against him, and his own captains hacked him into pieces. Torgon the Latecomer became the king and ruled for forty years.\u201d\nAsha took Tris Botley by the ears and kissed him full upon the lips. He was red and breathless by the time she let him go. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he said.\n\u201cA kiss, it\u2019s called. Drown me for a fool, Tris, I should have remembered\u2014\u201d She broke off suddenly. When Tris tried to speak, she shushed him, listening. \u201cThat\u2019s a warhorn. Hagen.\u201d Her first thought was of her husband. Could Erik Ironmaker have come all this way to claim his wayward wife? \u201cThe Drowned God loves me after all. Here I was wondering what to do, and he has sent me foes to fight.\u201d Asha got to her feet and slammed her knife back into its sheath. \u201cThe battle\u2019s come to us.\u201d\nShe was trotting by the time she reached the castle bailey, with Tris dogging her heels, but even so she came too late. The fight was done. Asha found two northmen bleeding by the eastern wall not far from the postern gate, with Lorren Longaxe, Six-Toed Harl, and Grimtongue standing over them. \u201cCromm and Hagen saw them coming over the wall,\u201d Grimtongue explained.\n\u201cJust these two?\u201d asked Asha.\n\u201cFive. We killed two before they could get over, and Harl slew another on the wallwalk. These two made it to the yard.\u201d\nOne man was dead, his blood and brains crusting Lorren\u2019s longaxe, but the second was still breathing raggedly, though Grimtongue\u2019s spear had pinned him to the ground in a spreading pool of blood. Both were clad in boiled leather and mottled cloaks of brown and green and black, with branches, leaves, and brush sewn about their heads and shoulders.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Asha asked the wounded man.\n\u201cA Flint. Who are you?\u201d\n\u201cAsha of House Greyjoy. This is my castle.\u201d\n\u201cDeepwood be Galbart Glover\u2019s seat. No home for squids.\u201d\n\u201cAre there any more of you?\u201d Asha demanded of him. When he did not answer, she seized Grimtongue\u2019s spear and turned it, and the northman cried out in anguish as more blood gushed from his wound. \u201cWhat was your purpose here?\u201d\n\u201cThe lady,\u201d he said, shuddering. \u201cGods, stop. We come for the lady. T\u2019 rescue her. It was just us five.\u201d\nAsha looked into his eyes. When she saw the falsehood there, she leaned upon the spear, twisting it. \u201cHow many more?\u201d she said. \u201cTell me, or I\u2019ll make your dying last until the dawn.\u201d\n\u201cMany,\u201d he finally sobbed, between screams. \u201cThousands. Three thousand, four\u00a0\u2026\u00a0aieeee\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nShe ripped the spear out of him and drove it down two-handed through his lying throat. Galbart Glover\u2019s maester had claimed the mountain clans were too quarrelsome to ever band together without a Stark to lead them. He might not have been lying. He might just have been wrong. She had learned what that tasted like at her nuncle\u2019s kingsmoot. \u201cThese five were sent to open our gates before the main attack,\u201d she said. \u201cLorren, Harl, fetch me Lady Glover and her maester.\u201d\n\u201cWhole or bloody?\u201d asked Lorren Longaxe.\n\u201cWhole and unharmed. Grimtongue, get up that thrice-damned tower and tell Cromm and Hagen to keep a sharp eye out. If they see so much as a hare, I want to know of it.\u201d\nDeepwood\u2019s bailey was soon full of frightened people. Her own men were struggling into armor or climbing up onto the wallwalks. Galbart Glover\u2019s folk looked on with fearful faces, whispering to one another. Glover\u2019s steward had to be carried up from the cellar, having lost a leg when Asha took the castle. The maester protested noisily until Lorren cracked him hard across the face with a mailed fist. Lady Glover emerged from the godswood on the arm of her bedmaid. \u201cI warned you that this day would come, my lady,\u201d she said, when she saw the corpses on the ground.\nThe maester pushed forward, with blood dripping from a broken nose. \u201cLady Asha, I beg you, strike your banners and let me bargain for your life. You have used us fairly, and with honor. I will tell them so.\u201d\n\u201cWe will exchange you for the children.\u201d Sybelle Glover\u2019s eyes were red, from tears and sleepless nights. \u201cGawen is four now. I missed his nameday. And my sweet girl\u00a0\u2026\u00a0give me back my children, and no harm need come to you. Nor to your men.\u201d\nThe last part was a lie, Asha knew. She might be exchanged, perhaps, shipped back to the Iron Islands to her husband\u2019s loving arms. Her cousins would be ransomed too, as would Tris Botley and a few more of her company, those whose kin had coin enough to buy them back. For the rest it would be the axe, the noose, or the Wall. Still, they have the right to choose.\nAsha climbed on a barrel so all of them could see her. \u201cThe wolves are coming down on us with their teeth bared. They will be at our gates before the sun comes up. Shall we throw down our spears and axes and plead with them to spare us?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Qarl the Maid drew his sword. \u201cNo,\u201d echoed Lorren Longaxe. \u201cNo,\u201d boomed Rolfe the Dwarf, a bear of a man who stood a head taller than anyone else in her crew. \u201cNever.\u201d And Hagen\u2019s horn sounded again from on high, ringing out across the bailey.\nAH\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200booo, the warhorn cried, long and low, a sound to curdle blood. Asha had begun to hate the sound of horns. On Old Wyk her uncle\u2019s hellhorn had blown a death knell for her dreams, and now Hagen was sounding what might well be her last hour on earth. If I must die, I will die with an axe in my hand and a curse upon my lips.\n\u201cTo the walls,\u201d Asha Greyjoy told her men. She turned her own steps for the watchtower, with Tris Botley right behind her.\nThe wooden watchtower was the tallest thing this side of the mountains, rising twenty feet above the biggest sentinels and soldier pines in the surrounding woods. \u201cThere, Captain,\u201d said Cromm, when she made the platform. Asha saw only trees and shadows, the moonlit hills and the snowy peaks beyond. Then she realized that trees were creeping closer. \u201cOho,\u201d she laughed, \u201cthese mountain goats have cloaked themselves in pine boughs.\u201d The woods were on the move, creeping toward the castle like a slow green tide. She thought back to a tale she had heard as a child, about the children of the forest and their battles with the First Men, when the greenseers turned the trees to warriors.\n\u201cWe cannot fight so many,\u201d Tris Botley said.\n\u201cWe can fight as many as come, pup,\u201d insisted Cromm. \u201cThe more there are, the more the glory. Men will sing of us.\u201d\nAye, but will they sing of your courage or my folly? The sea was five long leagues away. Would they do better to stand and fight behind Deepwood\u2019s deep ditches and wooden walls? Deepwood\u2019s wooden walls did the Glovers small good when I took their castle, she reminded herself. Why should they serve me any better?\n\u201cCome the morrow we will feast beneath the sea.\u201d Cromm stroked his axe as if he could not wait.\nHagen lowered his horn. \u201cIf we die with dry feet, how will we find our way to the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls?\u201d\n\u201cThese woods are full of little streams,\u201d Cromm assured him. \u201cAll of them lead to rivers, and all the rivers to the sea.\u201d\nAsha was not ready to die, not here, not yet. \u201cA living man can find the sea more easily than a dead one. Let the wolves keep their gloomy woods. We are making for the ships.\u201d\nShe wondered who was in command of her foes. If it were me, I would take the strand and put our longships to the torch before attacking Deepwood. The wolves would not find that easy, though, not without longships of their own. Asha never beached more than half her ships. The other half stood safely off to sea, with orders to raise sail and make for Sea Dragon Point if the northmen took the strand. \u201cHagen, blow your horn and make the forest shake. Tris, don some mail, it\u2019s time you tried out that sweet sword of yours.\u201d When she saw how pale he was, she pinched his cheek. \u201cSplash some blood upon the moon with me, and I promise you a kiss for every kill.\u201d\n\u201cMy queen,\u201d said Tristifer, \u201chere we have the walls, but if we reach the sea and find that the wolves have taken our ships or driven them away\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0we die,\u201d she finished cheerfully, \u201cbut at least we\u2019ll die with our feet wet. Ironborn fight better with salt spray in their nostrils and the sound of the waves at their backs.\u201d\nHagen blew three short blasts in quick succession, the signal that would send the ironborn back to their ships. From below came shouting, the clatter of spear and sword, the whinnying of horses. Too few horses and too few riders. Asha headed for the stair. In the bailey, she found Qarl the Maid waiting with her chestnut mare, her warhelm, and her throwing axes. Ironmen were leading horses from Galbart Glover\u2019s stables.\n\u201cA ram!\u201d a voice shouted down from the walls. \u201cThey have a battering ram!\u201d\n\u201cWhich gate?\u201d asked Asha, mounting up.\n\u201cThe north!\u201d From beyond Deepwood\u2019s mossy wooden walls came the sudden sound of trumpets.\nTrumpets? Wolves with trumpets? That was wrong, but Asha had no time to ponder it. \u201cOpen the south gate,\u201d she commanded, even as the north gate shook to the impact of the ram. She pulled a short-hafted throwing axe from the belt across her shoulder. \u201cThe hour of the owl has fled, my brothers. Now comes the hour of the spear, the sword, the axe. Form up. We\u2019re going home.\u201d\nFrom a hundred throats came roars of \u201cHome!\u201d and \u201cAsha!\u201d Tris Botley galloped up beside her on a tall roan stallion. In the bailey, her men closed about each other, hefting shields and spears. Qarl the Maid, no horse rider, took his place between Grimtongue and Lorren Longaxe. As Hagen came scrambling down the watchtower steps, a wolfling\u2019s arrow caught him in the belly and sent him plunging headfirst to the ground. His daughter ran to him, wailing. \u201cBring her,\u201d Asha commanded. This was no time for mourning. Rolfe the Dwarf pulled the girl onto his horse, her red hair flying. Asha could hear the north gate groaning as the ram slammed into it again. We may need to cut our way through them, she thought, as the south gate swung wide before them. The way was clear. For how long?\n\u201cMove out!\u201d Asha drove her heels into her horse\u2019s flanks.\nMen and mounts alike were trotting by the time they reached the trees on the far side of the sodden field, where dead shoots of winter wheat rotted beneath the moon. Asha held her horsemen back as a rear guard, to keep the stragglers moving and see that no one was left behind. Tall soldier pines and gnarled old oaks closed in around them. Deepwood was aptly named. The trees were huge and dark, somehow threatening. Their limbs wove through one another and creaked with every breath of wind, and their higher branches scratched at the face of the moon. The sooner we are shut of here, the better I will like it, Asha thought. The trees hate us all, deep in their wooden hearts.\nThey pressed on south and southwest, until the wooden towers of Deepwood Motte were lost to sight and the sounds of trumpets had been swallowed by the woods. The wolves have their castle back, she thought, perhaps they will be content to let us go.\nTris Botley trotted up beside her. \u201cWe are going the wrong way,\u201d he said, gesturing at the moon as it peered down through the canopy of branches. \u201cWe need to turn north, for the ships.\u201d\n\u201cWest first,\u201d Asha insisted. \u201cWest until the sun comes up. Then north.\u201d She turned to Rolfe the Dwarf and Roggon Rustbeard, her best riders. \u201cScout ahead and make sure our way is clear. I want no surprises when we reach the shore. If you come on wolves, ride back to me with word.\u201d\n\u201cIf we must,\u201d promised Roggon through his huge red beard.\nAfter the scouts had vanished into the trees, the rest of the ironborn resumed their march, but the going was slow. The trees hid the moon and stars from them, and the forest floor beneath their feet was black and treacherous. Before they had gone half a mile, her cousin Quenton\u2019s mare stumbled into a pit and shattered her foreleg. Quenton had to slit her throat to stop her screaming. \u201cWe should make torches,\u201d urged Tris.\n\u201cFire will bring the northmen down on us.\u201d Asha cursed beneath her breath, wondering if it had been a mistake to leave the castle. No. If we had stayed and fought, we might all be dead by now. But it was no good blundering on through the dark either. These trees will kill us if they can. She took off her helm and pushed back her sweat-soaked hair. \u201cThe sun will be up in a few hours. We\u2019ll stop here and rest till break of day.\u201d\nStopping proved simple; rest came hard. No one slept, not even Droop-eye Dale, an oarsman who had been known to nap between strokes. Some of the men shared a skin of Galbart Glover\u2019s apple wine, passing it from hand to hand. Those who had brought food shared it with those who had not. The riders fed and watered their horses. Her cousin Quenton Greyjoy sent three men up trees, to watch for any sign of torches in the woods. Cromm honed his axe, and Qarl the Maid his sword. The horses cropped dead brown grass and weeds. Hagen\u2019s red-haired daughter seized Tris Botley by the hand to draw him off into the trees. When he refused her, she went off with Six-Toed Harl instead.\nWould that I could do the same. It would be sweet to lose herself in Qarl\u2019s arms one last time. Asha had a bad feeling in her belly. Would she ever feel Black Wind\u2019s deck beneath her feet again? And if she did, where would she sail her? The isles are closed to me, unless I mean to bend my knees and spread my legs and suffer Eric Ironmaker\u2019s embraces, and no port in Westeros is like to welcome the kraken\u2019s daughter. She could turn merchanter, as Tris seemed to want, or else make for the Stepstones and join the pirates there. Or\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cI send you each a piece of prince,\u201d she muttered.\nQarl grinned. \u201cI would sooner have a piece of you,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthe sweet piece that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\nSomething flew from the brush to land with a soft thump in their midst, bumping and bouncing. It was round and dark and wet, with long hair that whipped about it as it rolled. When it came to rest amongst the roots of an oak, Grimtongue said, \u201cRolfe the Dwarf\u2019s not so tall as he once was.\u201d Half her men were on their feet by then, reaching for shields and spears and axes. They lit no torches either, Asha had time enough to think, and they know these woods better than we ever could. Then the trees erupted all around them, and the northmen poured in howling. Wolves, she thought, they howl like bloody wolves. The war cry of the north. Her ironborn screamed back at them, and the fight began.\nNo singer would ever make a song about that battle. No maester would ever write down an account for one of the Reader\u2019s beloved books. No banners flew, no warhorns moaned, no great lord called his men about him to hear his final ringing words. They fought in the predawn gloom, shadow against shadow, stumbling over roots and rocks, with mud and rotting leaves beneath their feet. The ironborn were clad in mail and salt-stained leather, the northmen in furs and hides and piney branches. The moon and stars looked down upon their struggle, their pale light filtered through the tangle of bare limbs that twisted overhead.\nThe first man to come at Asha Greyjoy died at her feet with her throwing axe between his eyes. That gave her respite enough to slip her shield onto her arm. \u201cTo me!\u201d she called, but whether she was calling to her own men or the foes even Asha could not have said for certain. A northman with an axe loomed up before her, swinging with both hands as he howled in wordless fury. Asha raised her shield to block his blow, then shoved in close to gut him with her dirk. His howling took on a different tone as he fell. She spun and found another wolf behind her, and slashed him across the brow beneath his helm. His own cut caught her below the breast, but her mail turned it, so she drove the point of her dirk into his throat and left him to drown in his own blood. A hand seized her hair, but short as it was he could not get a good enough grip to wrench her head back. Asha slammed her boot heel down onto his instep and wrenched loose when he cried out in pain. By the time she turned the man was down and dying, still clutching a handful of her hair. Qarl stood over him, with his longsword dripping and moonlight shining in his eyes.\nGrimtongue was counting the northmen as he killed them, calling out, \u201cFour,\u201d as one went down and, \u201cFive,\u201d a heartbeat later. The horses screamed and kicked and rolled their eyes in terror, maddened by the butchery and blood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all but Tris Botley\u2019s big roan stallion. Tris had gained the saddle, and his mount was rearing and wheeling as he laid about with his sword. I may owe him a kiss or three before the night is done, thought Asha.\n\u201cSeven,\u201d shouted Grimtongue, but beside him Lorren Longaxe sprawled with one leg twisted under him, and the shadows kept on coming, shouting and rustling. We are fighting shrubbery, Asha thought as she slew a man who had more leaves on him than most of the surrounding trees. That made her laugh. Her laughter drew more wolves to her, and she killed them too, wondering if she should start a count of her own. I am a woman wed, and here\u2019s my suckling babe. She pushed her dirk into a northman\u2019s chest through fur and wool and boiled leather. His face was so close to hers that she could smell the sour stench of his breath, and his hand was at her throat. Asha felt iron scraping against bone as her point slid over a rib. Then the man shuddered and died. When she let go of him, she was so weak she almost fell on top of him.\nLater, she stood back-to-back with Qarl, listening to the grunts and curses all around them, to brave men crawling through the shadows weeping for their mothers. A bush drove at her with a spear long enough to punch through her belly and Qarl\u2019s back as well, pinning them together as they died. Better that than die alone, she thought, but her cousin Quenton killed the spearman before he reached her. A heartbeat later another bush killed Quenton, driving an axe into the base of his skull.\nBehind her Grimtongue shouted, \u201cNine, and damn you all.\u201d Hagen\u2019s daughter burst naked from beneath the trees with two wolves at her heels. Asha wrenched loose a throwing axe and sent it flying end over end to take one of them in the back. When he fell, Hagen\u2019s daughter stumbled to her knees, snatched up his sword, stabbed the second man, then rose again, smeared with blood and mud, her long red hair unbound, and plunged into the fight.\nSomewhere in the ebb and flow of battle, Asha lost Qarl, lost Tris, lost all of them. Her dirk was gone as well, and all her throwing axes; instead she had a sword in hand, a short sword with a broad thick blade, almost like a butcher\u2019s cleaver. For her life she could not have said where she had gotten it. Her arm ached, her mouth tasted of blood, her legs were trembling, and shafts of pale dawn light were slanting through the trees. Has it been so long? How long have we been fighting?\nHer last foe was a northman with an axe, a big man bald and bearded, clad in a byrnie of patched and rusted mail that could only mean he was a chief or champion. He was not pleased to find himself fighting a woman. \u201cCunt!\u201d he roared each time he struck at her, his spittle dampening her cheeks. \u201cCunt! Cunt!\u201d\nAsha wanted to shout back at him, but her throat was so dry she could do no more than grunt. His axe was shivering her shield, cracking the wood on the downswing, tearing off long pale splinters when he wrenched it back. Soon she would have only a tangle of kindling on her arm. She backed away and shook free of the ruined shield, then backed away some more and danced left and right and left again to avoid the downrushing axe.\nAnd then her back came up hard against a tree, and she could dance no more. The wolf raised the axe above his head to split her head in two. Asha tried to slip to her right, but her feet were tangled in some roots, trapping her. She twisted, lost her footing, and the axehead crunched against her temple with a scream of steel on steel. The world went red and black and red again. Pain crackled up her leg like lightning, and far away she heard her northman say, \u201cYou bloody cunt,\u201d as he lifted up his axe for the blow that would finish her.\nA trumpet blew.\nThat\u2019s wrong, she thought. There are no trumpets in the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls. Below the waves the merlings hail their lord by blowing into seashells.\nShe dreamt of red hearts burning, and a black stag in a golden wood with flame streaming from his antlers.",

      "content": "TYRION\nBy the time they reached Volantis, the sky was purple to the west and black to the east, and the stars were coming out. The same stars as in Westeros, Tyrion Lannister reflected.\nHe might have taken some comfort in that if he had not been trussed up like a goose and lashed to a saddle. He had given up squirming. The knots that bound him were too tight. Instead he\u2019d gone as limp as a sack of meal. Saving my strength, he told himself, though for what he could not have said.\nVolantis closed its gates at dark, and the guardsmen on its northern gate were grumbling impatiently at the stragglers. They joined the queue behind a wagon laden with limes and oranges. The guards motioned the wagon through with their torches but took a harder look at the big Andal on his warhorse, with his longsword and his mail. A captain was summoned. Whilst he and the knight exchanged some words in Volantene, one of the guardsmen pulled off his clawed gauntlet and gave Tyrion\u2019s head a rub. \u201cI\u2019m full of good fortune,\u201d the dwarf told him. \u201cCut me loose, friend, and I\u2019ll see you\u2019re well rewarded.\u201d\nHis captor overheard. \u201cSave your lies for those who speak your tongue, Imp,\u201d he said, when the Volantenes waved them on.\nThey were moving again, through the gate and beneath the city\u2019s massive walls. \u201cYou speak my tongue. Can I sway you with promises, or are you determined to buy a lordship with my head?\u201d\n\u201cI was a lord, by right of birth. I want no hollow titles.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re like to get from my sweet sister.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here I\u2019d heard a Lannister always pays his debts.\u201d\n\u201cOh, every penny\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but never a groat more, my lord. You\u2019ll get the meal you bargained for, but it won\u2019t be sauced with gratitude, and in the end it will not nourish you.\u201d\n\u201cMight be all I want is to see you pay for crimes. The kinslayer is accursed in the eyes of gods and men.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods are blind. And men see only what they wish.\u201d\n\u201cI see you plain enough, Imp.\u201d Something dark had crept into the knight\u2019s tone. \u201cI have done things I am not proud of, things that brought shame onto my House and my father\u2019s name\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but to kill your own sire? How could any man do that?\u201d\n\u201cGive me a crossbow and pull down your breeches, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Gladly.\n\u201cYou think this is a jape?\u201d\n\u201cI think life is a jape. Yours, mine, everyone\u2019s.\u201d\nInside the city walls, they rode past guildhalls, markets, and bathhouses. Fountains splashed and sang in the centers of wide squares, where men sat at stone tables, moving cyvasse pieces and sipping wine from glass flutes as slaves lit ornate lanterns to hold the dark at bay. Palms and cedars grew along the cobbled road, and monuments stood at every junction. Many of the statues lacked heads, the dwarf noted, yet even headless they still managed to look imposing in the purple dusk.\nAs the warhorse plodded south along the river, the shops grew smaller and meaner, the trees along the street became a row of stumps. Cobblestones gave way to devilgrass beneath their horse\u2019s hooves, then to soft wet mud the color of a baby\u2019s nightsoil. The little bridges that spanned the small streams that fed the Rhoyne creaked alarmingly beneath their weight. Where a fort had once overlooked the river now stood a broken gate, gaping open like an old man\u2019s toothless mouth. Goats could be glimpsed peering over the parapets.\nOld Volantis, first daughter of Valyria, the dwarf mused. Proud Volantis, queen of the Rhoyne and mistress of the Summer Sea, home to noble lords and lovely ladies of the most ancient blood. Never mind the packs of naked children that roamed the alleys screaming in shrill voices, or the bravos standing in the doors of wineshops fingering their sword hilts, or the slaves with their bent backs and tattooed faces who scurried everywhere like cockroaches. Mighty Volantis, grandest and most populous of the Nine Free Cities. Ancient wars had depopulated much of the city, however, and large areas of Volantis had begun to sink back into the mud on which it stood. Beautiful Volantis, city of fountains and flowers. But half the fountains were dry, half the pools cracked and stagnant. Flowering vines sent up creepers from every crack in the wall or pavement, and young trees had taken root in the walls of abandoned shops and roofless temples.\nAnd then there was the smell. It hung in the hot, humid air, rich, rank, pervasive. There\u2019s fish in it, and flowers, and some elephant dung as well. Something sweet and something earthy and something dead and rotten. \u201cThis city smells like an old whore,\u201d Tyrion announced. \u201cLike some sagging slattern who has drenched her privy parts in perfume to drown the stench between her legs. Not that I am complaining. With whores, the young ones smell much better, but the old ones know more tricks.\u201d\n\u201cYou would know more of that than I do.\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course. That brothel where we met, did you take it for a sept? Was that your virgin sister squirming in your lap?\u201d\nThat made him scowl. \u201cGive that tongue of yours a rest unless you\u2019d rather I tied it in a knot.\u201d\nTyrion swallowed his retort. His lip was still fat and swollen from the last time he had pushed the big knight too far. Hard hands and no sense of humor makes for a bad marriage. That much he\u2019d learned on the road from Selhorys. His thoughts went to his boot, to the mushrooms in the toe. His captor had not searched him quite as thoroughly as he might have. There is always that escape. Cersei will not have me alive, at least.\nFarther south, signs of prosperity began to reappear. Abandoned buildings were seen less often, the naked children vanished, the bravos in the doorways seemed more sumptuously dressed. A few of the inns they passed actually looked like places where a man might sleep without fear of having his throat slit. Lanterns swung from iron stanchions along the river road, swaying when the wind blew. The streets grew broader, the buildings more imposing. Some were topped with great domes of colored glass. In the gathering dusk, with fires lit beneath them, the domes glowed blue and red and green and purple.\nEven so, there was something in the air that made Tyrion uneasy. West of the Rhoyne, he knew, the wharves of Volantis teemed with sailors, slaves, and traders, and the wineshops, inns, and brothels all catered to them. East of the river, strangers from across the seas were seen less seldom. We are not wanted here, the dwarf realized.\nThe first time they passed an elephant, Tyrion could not help but stare. There had been an elephant in the menagerie at Lannisport when he had been a boy, but she had died when he was seven\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and this great grey behemoth looked to be twice her size.\nFarther on, they fell in behind a smaller elephant, white as old bone and pulling an ornate cart. \u201cIs an oxcart an oxcart without an ox?\u201d Tyrion asked his captor. When that sally got no response, he lapsed back into silence, contemplating the rolling rump of the white dwarf elephant ahead of them.\nVolantis was overrun with white dwarf elephants. As they drew closer to the Black Wall and the crowded districts near the Long Bridge, they saw a dozen of them. Big grey elephants were not uncommon either\u2014huge beasts with castles on their backs. And in the half-light of evening the dung carts had come out, attended by half-naked slaves whose task it was to shovel up the steaming piles left by elephants both great and small. Swarms of flies followed the carts, so the dung slaves had flies tattooed upon their cheeks, to mark them for what they were. There\u2019s a trade for my sweet sister, Tyrion mused. She\u2019d look so pretty with a little shovel and flies tattooed on those sweet pink cheeks.\nBy then they had slowed to a crawl. The river road was thick with traffic, almost all of it flowing south. The knight went with it, a log caught in a current. Tyrion eyed the passing throngs. Nine men of every ten bore slave marks on their cheeks. \u201cSo many slaves\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where are they all going?\u201d\n\u201cThe red priests light their nightfires at sunset. The High Priest will be speaking. I would avoid it if I could, but to reach the Long Bridge we must pass the red temple.\u201d\nThree blocks later the street opened up before them onto a huge torchlit plaza, and there it stood. Seven save me, that\u2019s got to be three times the size of the Great Sept of Baelor. An enormity of pillars, steps, buttresses, bridges, domes, and towers flowing into one another as if they had all been chiseled from one collossal rock, the Temple of the Lord of Light loomed like Aegon\u2019s High Hill. A hundred hues of red, yellow, gold, and orange met and melded in the temple walls, dissolving one into the other like clouds at sunset. Its slender towers twisted ever upward, frozen flames dancing as they reached for the sky. Fire turned to stone. Huge nightfires burned beside the temple steps, and between them the High Priest had begun to speak.\nBenerro. The priest stood atop a red stone pillar, joined by a slender stone bridge to a lofty terrace where the lesser priests and acolytes stood. The acolytes were clad in robes of pale yellow and bright orange, priests and priestesses in red.\nThe great plaza before them was packed almost solid. Many and more of the worshipers were wearing some scrap of red cloth pinned to their sleeves or tied around their brows. Every eye was on the high priest, save theirs. \u201cMake way,\u201d the knight growled as his horse pushed through the throng. \u201cClear a path.\u201d The Volantenes gave way resentfully, with mutters and angry looks.\nBenerro\u2019s high voice carried well. Tall and thin, he had a drawn face and skin white as milk. Flames had been tattooed across his cheeks and chin and shaven head to make a bright red mask that crackled about his eyes and coiled down and around his lipless mouth. \u201cIs that a slave tattoo?\u201d asked Tyrion.\nThe knight nodded. \u201cThe red temple buys them as children and makes them priests or temple prostitutes or warriors. Look there.\u201d He pointed at the steps, where a line of men in ornate armor and orange cloaks stood before the temple\u2019s doors, clasping spears with points like writhing flames. \u201cThe Fiery Hand. The Lord of Light\u2019s sacred soldiers, defenders of the temple.\u201d\nFire knights. \u201cAnd how many fingers does this hand have, pray?\u201d\n\u201cOne thousand. Never more, and never less. A new flame is kindled for every one that gutters out.\u201d\nBenerro jabbed a finger at the moon, made a fist, spread his hands wide. When his voice rose in a crescendo, flames leapt from his fingers with a sudden whoosh and made the crowd gasp. The priest could trace fiery letters in the air as well. Valyrian glyphs. Tyrion recognized perhaps two in ten; one was Doom, the other Darkness.\nShouts erupted from the crowd. Women were weeping and men were shaking their fists. I have a bad feeling about this. The dwarf was reminded of the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne and the riot that boiled up as they made their way back to the Red Keep.\nHaldon Halfmaester had spoken of using the red priest to Young Griff\u2019s advantage, Tyrion recalled. Now that he had seen and heard the man himself, that struck him as a very bad idea. He hoped that Griff had better sense. Some allies are more dangerous than enemies. But Lord Connington will need to puzzle that one out for himself. I am like to be a head on a spike.\nThe priest was pointing at the Black Wall behind the temple, gesturing up at its parapets, where a handful of armored guardsmen stood gazing down. \u201cWhat is he saying?\u201d Tyrion asked the knight.\n\u201cThat Daenerys stands in peril. The dark eye has fallen upon her, and the minions of night are plotting her destruction, praying to their false gods in temples of deceit\u00a0\u2026\u00a0conspiring at betrayal with godless outlanders\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe hairs on the back of Tyrion\u2019s neck began to prickle. Prince Aegon will find no friend here. The red priest spoke of ancient prophecy, a prophecy that foretold the coming of a hero to deliver the world from darkness. One hero. Not two. Daenerys has dragons, Aegon does not. The dwarf did not need to be a prophet himself to foresee how Benerro and his followers might react to a second Targaryen. Griff will see that too, surely, he thought, surprised to find how much he cared.\nThe knight had forced their way through most of the press at the back of the plaza, ignoring the curses that were flung at them as they passed. One man stepped in front of them, but his captor gripped the hilt of his longsword and drew it just far enough to show a foot of naked steel. The man melted away, and all at once an alley opened up before them. The knight urged his mount to a trot, and they left the crowd behind them. For a while Tyrion could still hear Benerro\u2019s voice growing fainter at their back and the roars his words provoked, sudden as thunder.\nThey came upon a stable. The knight dismounted, then hammered on the door until a haggard slave with a horsehead on his cheek came running. The dwarf was pulled down roughly from the saddle and lashed to a post whilst his captor woke the stable\u2019s owner and haggled with him over the price of his horse and saddle. Cheaper to sell a horse than to ship one half across the world. Tyrion sensed a ship in his immediate future. Perhaps he was a prophet after all.\nWhen the dickering was done, the knight slung his weapons, shield, and saddlebag over his shoulder and asked for directions to the nearest smithy. That proved shuttered too, but opened quick enough at the knight\u2019s shout. The smith gave Tyrion a squint, then nodded and accepted a fistful of coins. \u201cCome here,\u201d the knight told his prisoner. He drew his dagger and slit Tyrion\u2019s bonds apart. \u201cMy thanks,\u201d said the dwarf as he rubbed his wrists, but the knight only laughed and said, \u201cSave your gratitude for someone who deserves it, Imp. You will not like this next bit.\u201d\nHe was not wrong.\nThe manacles were black iron, thick and heavy, each weighing a good two pounds, if the dwarf was any judge. The chains added even more weight. \u201cI must be more fearsome than I knew,\u201d Tyrion confessed as the last links were hammered closed. Each blow sent a shock up his arm almost to the shoulder. \u201cOr were you afraid that I would dash away on these stunted little legs of mine?\u201d\nThe ironsmith did not so much as look up from his work, but the knight chuckled darkly. \u201cIt\u2019s your mouth that concerns me, not your legs. In fetters, you\u2019re a slave. No one will listen to a word you say, not even those who speak the tongue of Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for this,\u201d Tyrion protested. \u201cI will be a good little prisoner, I will, I will.\u201d\n\u201cProve it, then, and shut your mouth.\u201d\nSo he bowed his head and bit his tongue as the chains were fixed, wrist to wrist, wrist to ankle, ankle to ankle. These bloody things weigh more than I do. Still, at least he drew breath. His captor could just as easily have cut his head off. That was all Cersei required, after all. Not striking it off straightaway had been his captor\u2019s first mistake. There is half a world between Volantis and King\u2019s Landing, and much and more can happen along the way, ser.\nThe rest of the way they went by foot, Tyrion clanking and clattering as he struggled to keep up with his captor\u2019s long, impatient strides. Whenever he threatened to fall behind, the knight would seize his fetters and yank them roughly, sending the dwarf stumbling and hopping along beside him. It could be worse. He could be urging me along with a whip.\nVolantis straddled one mouth of the Rhoyne where the river kissed the sea, its two halves joined by the Long Bridge. The oldest, richest part of the city was east of the river, but sellswords, barbarians, and other uncouth outlanders were not welcome there, so they must needs cross over to the west.\nThe gateway to the Long Bridge was a black stone arch carved with sphinxes, manticores, dragons, and creatures stranger still. Beyond the arch stretched the great span that the Valyrians had built at the height of their glory, its fused stone roadway supported by massive piers. The road was just wide enough for two carts to pass abreast, so whenever a wagon headed west passed one going east, both had to slow to a crawl.\nIt was well they were afoot. A third of the way out, a wagon laden with melons had gotten its wheels tangled with one piled high with silken carpets and brought all wheeled traffic to a halt. Much of the foot traffic had stopped as well, to watch the drivers curse and scream at one another, but the knight grabbed hold of Tyrion\u2019s chain and bulled a path through the throng for both of them. In the middle of the press, a boy tried to reach into his purse, but a hard elbow put an end to that and spread the thief\u2019s bloody nose across half his face.\nBuildings rose to either side of them: shops and temples, taverns and inns, cyvasse parlors and brothels. Most were three or four stories tall, each floor overhanging the one beneath it. Their top floors almost kissed. Crossing the bridge felt like passing through a torchlit tunnel. Along the span were shops and stalls of every sort; weavers and lacemakers displayed their wares cheek by jowl with glassblowers, candlemakers, and fishwives selling eels and oysters. Each goldsmith had a guard at his door, and every spicer had two, for their goods were twice as valuable. Here and there, between the shops, a traveler might catch a glimpse of the river he was crossing. To the north the Rhoyne was a broad black ribbon bright with stars, five times as wide as the Blackwater Rush at King\u2019s Landing. South of the bridge the river opened up to embrace the briny sea.\nAt the bridge\u2019s center span, the severed hands of thieves and cutpurses hung like strings of onions from iron stanchions along the roadway. Three heads were on display as well\u2014two men and a woman, their crimes scrawled on tablets underneath them. A pair of spearmen attended them, clad in polished helms and shirts of silver mail. Across their cheeks were tiger stripes as green as jade. From time to time the guards waved their spears to chase away the kestrels, gulls, and carrion crows paying court to the deceased. The birds returned to the heads within moments.\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Tyrion inquired innocently.\nThe knight glanced at the inscriptions. \u201cThe woman was a slave who raised her hand to her mistress. The older man was accused of fomenting rebellion and spying for the dragon queen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the young one?\u201d\n\u201cKilled his father.\u201d\nTyrion gave the rotting head a second look. Why, it almost looks as if those lips are smiling.\nFarther on, the knight paused briefly to consider a jeweled tiara displayed upon a bed of purple velvet. He passed that by, but a few steps on he stopped again to haggle over a pair of gloves at a leatherworker\u2019s stall. Tyrion was grateful for the respites. The headlong pace had left him puffing, and his wrists were chafed raw from the manacles.\nFrom the far end of the Long Bridge, it was only a short walk through the teeming waterfront districts of the west bank, down torchlit streets crowded with sailors, slaves, and drunken merrymakers. Once an elephant lumbered past with a dozen half-naked slave girls waving from the castle on its back, teasing passersby with glimpses of their breasts and crying, \u201cMalaquo, Malaquo.\u201d They made such an entrancing sight that Tyrion almost waddled right into the steaming pile of dung the elephant had left to mark its passage. He was saved at the last instant when the knight snatched him aside, yanking on his chain so hard it made him reel and stumble.\n\u201cHow much farther?\u201d the dwarf asked.\n\u201cJust there. Fishmonger\u2019s Square.\u201d\nTheir destination proved to be the Merchant\u2019s House, a four-story monstrosity that squatted amongst the warehouses, brothels, and taverns of the waterside like some enormous fat man surrounded by children. Its common room was larger than the great halls of half the castles in Westeros, a dim-lit maze of a place with a hundred private alcoves and hidden nooks whose blackened beams and cracked ceilings echoed to the din of sailors, traders, captains, money changers, shippers, and slavers, lying, cursing, and cheating each other in half a hundred different tongues.\nTyrion approved the choice of hostelry. Soon or late the Shy Maid must reach Volantis. This was the city\u2019s biggest inn, first choice for shippers, captains, and merchantmen. A lot of business was done in that cavernous warren of a common room. He knew enough of Volantis to know that. Let Griff turn up here with Duck and Haldon, and he would be free again soon enough.\nMeanwhile, he would be patient. His chance would come.\nThe rooms upstairs proved rather less than grand, however, particularly the cheap ones up on the fourth floor. Wedged into a corner of the building beneath a sloping roof, the bedchamber his captor had engaged featured a low ceiling, a sagging feather bed with an unpleasant odor, and a slanting wood-plank floor that reminded Tyrion of his sojourn at the Eyrie. At least this room has walls. It had windows too; those were its chief amenity, along with the iron ring set in the wall, so useful for chaining up one\u2019s slaves. His captor paused only long enough to light a tallow candle before securing Tyrion\u2019s chains to the ring.\n\u201cMust you?\u201d the dwarf protested, rattling feebly. \u201cWhere am I going to go, out the window?\u201d\n\u201cYou might.\u201d\n\u201cWe are four floors up, and I cannot fly.\u201d\n\u201cYou can fall. I want you alive.\u201d\nAye, but why? Cersei is not like to care. Tyrion rattled his chains. \u201cI know who you are, ser.\u201d It had not been hard to puzzle out. The bear on his surcoat, the arms on his shield, the lost lordship he had mentioned. \u201cI know what you are. And if you know who I am, you also know that I was the King\u2019s Hand and sat in council with the Spider. Would it interest you to know that it was the eunuch who dispatched me on this journey?\u201d Him and Jaime, but I\u2019ll leave my brother out of it. \u201cI am as much his creature as you are. We ought not be at odds.\u201d\nThat did not please the knight. \u201cI took the Spider\u2019s coin, I\u2019ll not deny it, but I was never his creature. And my loyalties lie elsewhere now.\u201d\n\u201cWith Cersei? More fool you. All my sister requires is my head, and you have a fine sharp sword. Why not end this farce now and spare us both?\u201d\nThe knight laughed. \u201cIs this some dwarf\u2019s trick? Beg for death in hopes I\u2019ll let you live?\u201d He went to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something from the kitchens.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of you. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\n\u201cI know you will.\u201d Yet when the knight left, he locked the door behind him with a heavy iron key. The Merchant\u2019s House was famous for its locks. As secure as a gaol, the dwarf thought bitterly, but at least there are those windows.\nTyrion knew that the chances of his escaping his chains were little and less, but even so, he felt obliged to try. His efforts to slip a hand through the manacle served only to scrap off more skin and leave his wrist slick with blood, and all his tugging or twisting could not pull the iron ring from the wall. Bugger this, he thought, slumping back as far as his chains would allow. His legs had begun to cramp. This was going to be a hellishly uncomfortable night. The first of many, I do not doubt.\nThe room was stifling, so the knight had opened the shutters to let in a cross breeze. Cramped into a corner of the building under the eaves, the chamber was fortunate in having two windows. One looked toward the Long Bridge and the black-walled heart of Old Volantis across the river. The other opened on the square below. Fishermonger\u2019s Square, Mormont called it. As tight as the chains were, Tyrion found he could see out the latter by leaning sideways and letting the iron ring support his weight. Not as long a fall as the one from Lysa Arryn\u2019s sky cells, but it would leave me just as dead. Perhaps if I were drunk\u00a0\u2026\nEven at this hour the square was crowded, with sailors roistering, whores prowling for custom, and merchants going about their business. A red priestess scurried past, attended by a dozen acolytes with torches, their robes whisking about their ankles. Elsewhere a pair of cyvasse players waged war outside a tavern. A slave stood beside their table, holding a lantern over the board. Tyrion could hear a woman singing. The words were strange, the tune was soft and sad. If I knew what she was singing, I might cry. Closer to hand, a crowd was gathering around a pair of jugglers throwing flaming torches at each other.\nHis captor returned shortly, carrying two tankards and a roasted duck. He kicked the door shut, ripped the duck in two, and tossed half of it to Tyrion. He would have snatched it from the air, but his chains brought him up short when he tried to lift his arms. Instead the bird struck his temple and slid hot and greasy down his face, and he had to hunker down and stretch for it with fetters clanking. He got it on the third try and tore into it happily with his teeth. \u201cSome ale to wash this down?\u201d\nMormont handed him a tankard. \u201cMost of Volantis is getting drunk, why not you?\u201d\nThe ale was sweet as well. It tasted of fruit. Tyrion drank a healthy swallow and belched happily. The tankard was pewter, very heavy. Empty it and fling it at his head, he thought. If I am lucky, it might crack his skull. If I\u2019m very lucky, it will miss, and he\u2019ll beat me to death with his fists. He took another gulp. \u201cIs this some holy day?\u201d\n\u201cThird day of their elections. They last for ten. Ten days of madness. Torchlight marches, speeches, mummers and minstrels and dancers, bravos fighting death duels for the honor of their candidates, elephants with the names of would-be triarchs painted on their sides. Those jugglers are performing for Methyso.\u201d\n\u201cRemind me to vote for someone else.\u201d Tyrion licked grease from his fingers. Below, the crowd was flinging coins at the jugglers. \u201cDo all these would-be triarchs provide mummer shows?\u201d\n\u201cThey do whatever they think will win them votes,\u201d said Mormont. \u201cFood, drink, spectacle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Alios has sent a hundred pretty slave girls out into the streets to lie with voters.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m for him,\u201d Tyrion decided. \u201cBring me a slave girl.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re for freeborn Volantenes with enough property to vote. Precious few voters west of the river.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this goes on for ten days?\u201d Tyrion laughed. \u201cI might enjoy that, though three kings is two too many. I am trying to imagine ruling the Seven Kingdoms with my sweet sister and brave brother beside me. One of us would kill the other two inside a year. I am surprised these triarchs don\u2019t do the same.\u201d\n\u201cA few have tried. Might be the Volantenes are the clever ones and us Westerosi the fools. Volantis has known her share of follies, but she\u2019s never suffered a boy triarch. Whenever a madman\u2019s been elected, his colleagues restrain him until his year has run its course. Think of the dead who might still live if Mad Aerys only had two fellow kings to share the rule.\u201d\nInstead he had my father, Tyrion thought.\n\u201cSome in the Free Cities think that we\u2019re all savages on our side of the narrow sea,\u201d the knight went on. \u201cThe ones who don\u2019t think that we\u2019re children, crying out for a father\u2019s strong hand.\u201d\n\u201cOr a mother\u2019s?\u201d Cersei will love that. Especially when he presents her with my head. \u201cYou seem to know this city well.\u201d\n\u201cI spent the best part of a year here.\u201d The knight sloshed the dregs at the bottom of his tankard. \u201cWhen Stark drove me into exile, I fled to Lys with my second wife. Braavos would have suited me better, but Lynesse wanted someplace warm. Instead of serving the Braavosi I fought them on the Rhoyne, but for every silver I earned my wife spent ten. By the time I got back to Lys, she had taken a lover, who told me cheerfully that I would be enslaved for debt unless I gave her up and left the city. That was how I came to Volantis\u00a0\u2026\u00a0one step ahead of slavery, owning nothing but my sword and the clothes upon my back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you want to run home.\u201d\nThe knight drained the last of his ale. \u201cOn the morrow I\u2019ll find us a ship. The bed is mine. You can have whatever piece of floor your chains will let you reach. Sleep if you can. If not, count your crimes. That should see you through till the morning.\u201d\nYou have your crimes to answer for, Jorah Mormont, the dwarf thought, but it seemed wiser to keep that thought to himself.\nSer Jorah hung his sword belt on a bedpost, kicked off his boots, pulled his chain mail over his head, and stripped out of his wool and leather and sweat-stained undertunic to reveal a scarred, brawny torso covered with dark hair. If I could skin him, I could sell that pelt for a fur cloak, Tyrion thought as Mormont tumbled into the slightly smelly comfort of his sagging feather bed.\nIn no time at all the knight was snoring, leaving his prize alone with his chains. With both windows open wide, the light of the waning moon spilled across the bedchamber. Sounds drifted up from the square below: snatches of drunken song, the yowling of a cat in heat, the far-off ring of steel on steel. Someone\u2019s about to die, thought Tyrion.\nHis wrist was throbbing where he\u2019d torn the skin, and his fetters made it impossible for him to sit, let alone stretch out. The best he could do was twist sideways to lean against the wall, and before long he began to lose all feeling in his hands. When he moved to relieve the strain, sensation came flooding back as pain. He had to grind his teeth to keep from screaming. He wondered how much his father had hurt when the quarrel punched through his groin, what Shae had felt as he twisted the chain around her lying throat, what Tysha had been feeling as they raped her. His sufferings were nothing compared to their own, but that did not make him hurt any less. Just make it stop.\nSer Jorah had rolled onto one side, so all that Tyrion could see of him was a broad, hairy, muscular back. Even if I could slip these chains, I\u2019d need to climb over him to reach his sword belt. Perhaps if I could ease the dagger loose\u00a0\u2026 Or else he could try for the key, unlock the door, creep down the stairs and through the common room\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and go where? I have no friends, no coin, I do not even speak the local tongue.\nExhaustion finally overwhelmed his pains, and Tyrion drifted off into a fitful sleep. But every time another cramp took root inside his calf and twisted, the dwarf would cry out in his sleep, trembling in his chains. He woke with every muscle aching, to find morning streaming through the windows bright and golden as the lion of Lannister. Below he could hear the cries of fishmongers and the rumble of iron-rimmed wheels on cobblestones.\nJorah Mormont was standing over him. \u201cIf I take you off the ring, will you do as you\u2019re told?\u201d\n\u201cWill it involve dancing? I might find dancing difficult. I cannot feel my legs. They may have fallen off. Elsewise, I am your creature. On my honor as a Lannister.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lannisters have no honor.\u201d Ser Jorah loosed his chains anyway. Tyrion took two wobbly steps and fell. The blood rushing back into his hands brought tears to his eyes. He bit his lip and said, \u201cWherever we\u2019re going, you will need to roll me there.\u201d\nInstead the big knight carried him, hoisting him by the chain between his wrists.\nThe common room of the Merchant\u2019s House was a dim labyrinth of alcoves and grottoes built around a central courtyard where a trellis of flowering vines threw intricate patterns across the flagstone floor and green and purple moss grew between the stones. Slave girls scurried through light and shadow, bearing flagons of ale and wine and some iced green drink that smelled of mint. One table in twenty was occupied at this hour of the morning.\nOne of those was occupied by a dwarf. Clean-shaved and pink-cheeked, with a mop of chestnut hair, a heavy brow, and a squashed nose, he perched on a high stool with a wooden spoon in hand, contemplating a bowl of purplish gruel with red-rimmed eyes. Ugly little bastard, Tyrion thought.\nThe other dwarf felt his stare. When he raised his head and saw Tyrion, the spoon slipped from his hand.\n\u201cHe saw me,\u201d Tyrion warned Mormont.\n\u201cWhat of it?\u201d\n\u201cHe knows me. Who I am.\u201d\n\u201cShould I stuff you in a sack, so no one will see you?\u201d The knight touched the hilt of his longsword. \u201cIf he means to try and take you, he is welcome to try.\u201d\nWelcome to die, you mean, thought Tyrion. What threat could he pose to a big man like you? He is only a dwarf.\nSer Jorah claimed a table in a quiet corner and ordered food and drink. They broke their fast with warm soft flatbread, pink fish roe, honey sausage, and fried locusts, washed down with a bittersweet black ale. Tyrion ate like a man half-starved. \u201cYou have a healthy appetite this morning,\u201d the knight observed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the food in hell is wretched.\u201d Tyrion glanced at the door, where a man had just come in: tall and stooped, his pointed beard dyed a splotchy purple. Some Tyroshi trader. A gust of sound came with him from outside; the cries of gulls, a woman\u2019s laughter, the voices of the fishmongers. For half a heartbeat he thought he glimpsed Illyrio Mopatis, but it was only one of those white dwarf elephants passing the front door.\nMormont spread some fish roe across a slice of flatbread and took a bite. \u201cAre you expecting someone?\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cYou never know who the wind might blow in. My one true love, my father\u2019s ghost, a duck.\u201d He popped a locust into his mouth and crunched it. \u201cNot bad. For a bug.\u201d\n\u201cLast night the talk here was all of Westeros. Some exiled lord has hired the Golden Company to win back his lands for him. Half the captains in Volantis are racing upriver to Volon Therys to offer him their ships.\u201d\nTyrion had just swallowed another locust. He almost choked on it. Is he mocking me? How much could he know of Griff and Aegon? \u201cBugger,\u201d he said. \u201cI meant to hire the Golden Company myself, to win me Casterly Rock.\u201d Could this be some ploy of Griff\u2019s, false reports deliberately spread? Unless\u00a0\u2026 Could the pretty princeling have swallowed the bait? Turned them west instead of east, abandoning his hopes of wedding Queen Daenerys? Abandoning the dragons\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would Griff allow that? \u201cI\u2019ll gladly hire you as well, ser. My father\u2019s seat is mine by rights. Swear me your sword, and once I win it back I\u2019ll drown you in gold.\u201d\n\u201cI saw a man drowned in gold once. It was not a pretty sight. If you ever get my sword, it will be through your bowels.\u201d\n\u201cA sure cure for constipation,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cJust ask my father.\u201d He reached for his tankard and took a slow swallow, to help conceal whatever might be showing on his face. It had to be a stratagem, designed to lull Volantene suspicions. Get the men aboard with this false pretext and seize the ships when the fleet is out to sea. Is that Griff\u2019s plan? It might work. The Golden Company was ten thousand strong, seasoned and disciplined. None of them seamen, though. Griff will need to keep a sword at every throat, and should they come on Slaver\u2019s Bay and need to fight\u00a0\u2026\nThe serving girl returned. \u201cThe widow will see you next, noble ser. Have you brought a gift for her?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d Ser Jorah slipped a coin into the girl\u2019s palm and sent her on her way.\nTyrion frowned. \u201cWhose widow is this?\u201d\n\u201cThe widow of the waterfront. East of the Rhoyne they still call her Vogarro\u2019s whore, though never to her face.\u201d\nThe dwarf was not enlightened. \u201cAnd Vogarro was \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cAn elephant, seven times a triarch, very rich, a power on the docks. Whilst other men built the ships and sailed them, he built piers and storehouses, brokered cargoes, changed money, insured shipowners against the hazards of the sea. He dealt in slaves as well. When he grew besotted with one of them, a bedslave trained at Yunkai in the way of seven sighs, it was a great scandal\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and a greater scandal when he freed her and took her for his wife. After he died, she carried on his ventures. No freedman may dwell within the Black Wall, so she was compelled to sell Vogarro\u2019s manse. She took up residence at the Merchant\u2019s House. That was thirty-two years ago, and she remains here to this day. That\u2019s her behind you, back by the courtyard, holding court at her customary table. No, don\u2019t look. There\u2019s someone with her now. When he\u2019s done, it will be our turn.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this old harridan will help you how?\u201d\nSer Jorah stood. \u201cWatch and see. He\u2019s leaving.\u201d\nTyrion hopped down off his chair with a rattle of iron. This should be enlightening.\nThere was something vulpine about the way the woman sat in her corner by the courtyard, something reptilian about her eyes. Her white hair was so thin that the pink of her scalp showed through. Under one eye she still bore faint scars where a knife had cut away her tears. The remnants of her morning meal littered the table\u2014sardine heads, olive pits, chunks of flatbread. Tyrion did not fail to note how well chosen her \u201ccustomary table\u201d was; solid stone at her back, a leafy alcove to one side for entrances and exits, a perfect view of the inn\u2019s front door, yet so steeped in shadow that she herself was nigh invisible.\nThe sight of him made the old woman smile. \u201cA dwarf,\u201d she purred, in a voice as sinister as it was soft. She spoke the Common Tongue with only a trace of accent. \u201cVolantis has been overrun with dwarfs of late, it seems. Does this one do tricks?\u201d\nYes, Tyrion wanted to say. Give me a crossbow, and I\u2019ll show you my favorite. \u201cNo,\u201d Ser Jorah answered.\n\u201cA pity. I once had a monkey who could perform all sorts of clever tricks. Your dwarf reminds me of him. Is he a gift?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I brought you these.\u201d Ser Jorah produced his pair of gloves, and slapped them down on the table beside the other gifts the widow had received this morning: a silver goblet, an ornate fan carved of jade leaves so thin they were translucent, and an ancient bronze dagger marked with runes. Beside such treasures the gloves looked cheap and tawdry.\n\u201cGloves for my poor old wrinkled hands. How nice.\u201d The widow made no move to touch them.\n\u201cI bought them on the Long Bridge.\u201d\n\u201cA man can buy most anything on the Long Bridge. Gloves, slaves, monkeys.\u201d The years had bent her spine and put a crone\u2019s hump upon her back, but the widow\u2019s eyes were bright and black. \u201cNow tell this old widow how she may be of service to you.\u201d\n\u201cWe need swift passage to Meereen.\u201d\nOne word. Tyrion Lannister\u2019s world turned upside down.\nOne word. Meereen. Or had he misheard?\nOne word. Meereen, he said Meereen, he\u2019s taking me to Meereen. Meereen meant life. Or hope for life, at least.\n\u201cWhy come to me?\u201d the widow said. \u201cI own no ships.\u201d\n\u201cYou have many captains in your debt.\u201d\nDeliver me to the queen, he says. Aye, but which queen? He isn\u2019t selling me to Cersei. He\u2019s giving me to Daenerys Targaryen. That\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t hacked my head off. We\u2019re going east, and Griff and his prince are going west, the bloody fools.\nOh, it was all too much. Plots within plots, but all roads lead down the dragon\u2019s gullet. A guffaw burst from his lips, and suddenly Tyrion could not stop laughing.\n\u201cYour dwarf is having a fit,\u201d the widow observed.\n\u201cMy dwarf will be quiet, or I\u2019ll see him gagged.\u201d\nTyrion covered his mouth with his hands. Meereen!\nThe widow of the waterfront decided to ignore him. \u201cShall we have a drink?\u201d she asked. Dust motes floated in the air as a serving girl filled two green glass cups for Ser Jorah and the widow. Tyrion\u2019s throat was dry, but no cup was poured for him. The widow took a sip, rolled the wine round her mouth, swallowed. \u201cAll the other exiles are sailing west, or so these old ears have heard. And all those captains in my debt are falling over one another to take them there and leach a little gold from the coffers of the Golden Company. Our noble triarchs have pledged a dozen warships to the cause, to see the fleet safely as far as the Stepstones. Even old Doniphos has given his assent. Such a glorious adventure. And yet you would go the other way, ser.\u201d\n\u201cMy business is in the east.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what business is that, I wonder? Not slaves, the silver queen has put an end to that. She has closed the fighting pits as well, so it cannot be a taste for blood. What else could Meereen offer to a Westerosi knight? Bricks? Olives? Dragons? Ah, there it is.\u201d The old woman\u2019s smile turned feral. \u201cI have heard it said that the silver queen feeds them with the flesh of infants while she herself bathes in the blood of virgin girls and takes a different lover every night.\u201d\nSer Jorah\u2019s mouth had hardened. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i are pouring poison in your ears. My lady should not believe such filth.\u201d\n\u201cI am no lady, but even Vogarro\u2019s whore knows the taste of falsehood. This much is true, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the dragon queen has enemies\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Yunkai, New Ghis, Tolos, Qarth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0aye, and Volantis, soon enough. You would travel to Meereen? Just wait a while, ser. Swords will be wanted soon enough, when the warships bend their oars eastward to bring down the silver queen. Tigers love to bare their claws, and even elephants will kill if threatened. Malaquo hungers for a taste of glory, and Nyessos owes much of his wealth to the slave trade. Let Alios or Parquello or Belicho gain the triarchy, and the fleets will sail.\u201d\nSer Jorah scowled. \u201cIf Doniphos is returned\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cVogarro will be returned first, and my sweet lord has been dead these thirty years.\u201d\nBehind them, some sailor was bellowing loudly. \u201cThey call this ale? Fuck. A monkey could piss better ale.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you would drink it,\u201d another voice replied.\nTyrion twisted around for a look, hoping against hope that it was Duck and Haldon he was hearing. Instead he saw two strangers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the dwarf, who was standing a few feet away staring at him intently. He seemed somehow familiar.\nThe widow sipped daintily at her wine. \u201cSome of the first elephants were women,\u201d she said, \u201cthe ones who brought the tigers down and ended the old wars. Trianna was returned four times. That was three hundred years ago, alas. Volantis has had no female triarch since, though some women have the vote. Women of good birth who dwell in ancient palaces behind the Black Walls, not creatures such as me. The Old Blood will have their dogs and children voting before any freedman. No, it will be Belicho, or perhaps Alios, but either way it will be war. Or so they think.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d Ser Jorah asked.\nGood, thought Tyrion. The right question.\n\u201cOh, I think it will be war as well, but not the war they want.\u201d The old woman leaned forward, her black eyes gleaming. \u201cI think that red R\u2019hllor has more worshipers in this city than all the other gods together. Have you heard Benerro preach?\u201d\n\u201cLast night.\u201d\n\u201cBenerro can see the morrow in his flames,\u201d the widow said. \u201cTriarch Malaquo tried to hire the Golden Company, did you know? He meant to clean out the red temple and put Benerro to the sword. He dare not use tiger cloaks. Half of them worship the Lord of Light as well. Oh, these are dire days in Old Volantis, even for wrinkled old widows. But not half so dire as in Meereen, I think. So tell me, ser\u00a0\u2026\u00a0why do you seek the silver queen?\u201d\n\u201cThat is my concern. I can pay for our passage and pay well. I have the silver.\u201d\nFool, thought Tyrion. It\u2019s not coin she wants, it\u2019s respect. Haven\u2019t you heard a word she\u2019s said? He glanced back over his shoulder again. The dwarf had moved closer to their table. And he seemed to have a knife in his hand. The hairs on the back of Tyrion\u2019s neck began to prickle.\n\u201cKeep your silver. I have gold. And spare me your black looks, ser. I am too old to be frightened of a scowl. You are a hard man, I see, and no doubt skilled with that long sword at your side, but this is my realm. Let me crook a finger and you may find yourself traveling to Meereen chained to an oar in the belly of a galley.\u201d She lifted her jade fan and opened it. There was a rustle of leaves, and a man slid from the overgrown archway to her left. His face was a mass of scars, and in one hand he held a sword, short and heavy as a cleaver. \u201cSeek the widow of the waterfront, someone told you, but they should have also warned you, beware the widow\u2019s sons. It is such a sweet morning, though, I shall ask again. Why would you seek Daenerys Targaryen, whom half the world wants dead?\u201d\nJorah Mormont\u2019s face was dark with anger, but he answered. \u201cTo serve her. Defend her. Die for her, if need be.\u201d\nThat made the widow laugh. \u201cYou want to rescue her, is that the way of it? From more enemies than I can name, with swords beyond count\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this is what you\u2019d have the poor widow believe? That you are a true and chivalrous Westerosi knight crossing half the world to come to the aid of this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, she is no maiden, though she may still be fair.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cDo you think your dwarf will please her? Will she bathe in his blood, do you think, or content herself with striking off his head?\u201d\nSer Jorah hesitated. \u201cThe dwarf is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014I know who the dwarf is, and what he is.\u201d Her black eyes turned to Tyrion, hard as stone. \u201cKinslayer, kingslayer, murderer, turncloak. Lannister.\u201d She made the last a curse. \u201cWhat do you plan to offer the dragon queen, little man?\u201d\nMy hate, Tyrion wanted to say. Instead he spread his hands as far as the fetters would allow. \u201cWhatever she would have of me. Sage counsel, savage wit, a bit of tumbling. My cock, if she desires it. My tongue, if she does not. I will lead her armies or rub her feet, as she desires. And the only reward I ask is I might be allowed to rape and kill my sister.\u201d\nThat brought the smile back to the old woman\u2019s face. \u201cThis one at least is honest,\u201d she announced, \u201cbut you, ser\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have known a dozen Westerosi knights and a thousand adventurers of the same ilk, but none so pure as you would paint yourself. Men are beasts, selfish and brutal. However gentle the words, there are always darker motives underneath. I do not trust you, ser.\u201d She flicked them off with her fan, as if they were no more than flies buzzing about her head. \u201cIf you want to get to Meereen, swim. I have no help to give you.\u201d\nThen seven hells broke out at once.\nSer Jorah started to rise, the widow snapped her fan closed, her scarred man slid out of the shadows\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and behind them a girl screamed. Tyrion spun just in time to see the dwarf rushing toward him. She\u2019s a girl, he realized all at once, a girl dressed up in man\u2019s clothes. And she means to gut me with that knife.\nFor half a heartbeat Ser Jorah, the widow, and the scarred man stood still as stone. Idlers watched from nearby tables, sipping ale and wine, but no one moved to interfere. Tyrion had to move both hands at once, but his chains had just enough give for him to reach the flagon on the table. He closed his fist around it, spun, dashed its contents into the face of the charging dwarf girl, then threw himself to one side to avoid her knife. The flagon shattered underneath him as the floor came up to smack him in the head. Then the girl was on him once again. Tyrion rolled on one side as she buried the knife blade in the floorboards, yanked it free, raised it again\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and suddenly she was rising off the floor, legs kicking wildly as she struggled in Ser Jorah\u2019s grasp. \u201cNo!\u201d she wailed, in the Common Tongue of Westeros. \u201cLet go!\u201d Tyrion heard her tunic rip as she fought to free herself.\nMormont had her by the collar with one hand. With the other he wrenched the dagger from her grasp. \u201cEnough.\u201d\nThe landlord made his appearance then, a cudgel in his hand. When he saw the broken flagon, he uttered a blistering curse and demanded to know what had happened here. \u201cDwarf fight,\u201d replied the Tyroshi with the purple beard, chuckling.\nTyrion blinked up at the dripping girl twisting in the air. \u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat did I ever do to you?\u201d\n\u201cThey killed him.\u201d All the fight went out of her at that. She hung limply in Mormont\u2019s grasp as her eyes filled with tears. \u201cMy brother. They took him and they killed him.\u201d\n\u201cWho killed him?\u201d asked Mormont.\n\u201cSailors. Sailors from the Seven Kingdoms. There were five of them, drunk. They saw us jousting in the square and followed us. When they realized I was a girl they let me go, but they took my brother and killed him. They cut his head off.\u201d\nTyrion felt a sudden shock of recognition. They saw us jousting in the square. He knew who the girl was then. \u201cDid you ride the pig?\u201d he asked her. \u201cOr the dog?\u201d\n\u201cThe dog,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cOppo always rode the pig.\u201d\nThe dwarfs from Joffrey\u2019s wedding. It was their show that had started all the trouble that night. How strange, to encounter them again half a world away. Though perhaps not so strange as that. If they had half the wits of their pig, they would have fled King\u2019s Landing the night Joff died, before Cersei could assign them some share of blame in her son\u2019s death. \u201cLet her down, ser,\u201d he told Ser Jorah Mormont. \u201cShe won\u2019t do us any harm.\u201d\nSer Jorah dumped the dwarf girl on the floor. \u201cI am sorry for your brother\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but we had no part in his murder.\u201d\n\u201cHe did.\u201d The girl pushed herself to her knees, clutching her torn, wine-drenched tunic to small, pale breasts. \u201cIt was him they wanted. They thought Oppo was him.\u201d The girl was weeping, begging for help from anyone who would listen. \u201cHe should die, the way my poor brother died. Please. Someone help me. Someone kill him.\u201d The landlord seized her roughly by one arm and wrenched her back to her feet, shouting in Volantene, demanding to know who was going to pay for this damage.\nThe widow of the waterfront gave Mormont a cool look. \u201cKnights defend the weak and protect the innocent, they say. And I am the fairest maid in all Volantis.\u201d Her laugh was full of scorn. \u201cWhat do they call you, child?\u201d\n\u201cPenny.\u201d\nThe old woman called out to the landlord in the tongue of Old Volantis. Tyrion knew enough to understand that she was telling him to take the dwarf girl up to her rooms, give her wine, and find some clothes for her to wear.\nWhen they were gone, the widow studied Tyrion, her black eyes shining. \u201cMonsters should be larger, it seems to me. You are worth a lordship back in Westeros, little man. Here, I fear, your worth is somewhat less. But I think I had best help you after all. Volantis is no safe place for dwarfs, it seems.\u201d\n\u201cYou are too kind.\u201d Tyrion gave her his sweetest smile. \u201cPerhaps you would remove these charming iron bracelets as well? This monster has but half a nose, and it itches most abominably. The chains are too short for me to scratch it. I\u2019ll make you a gift of them, and gladly.\u201d\n\u201cHow generous. But I have worn iron in my time, and now I find that I prefer gold and silver. And sad to say, this is Volantis, where fetters and chains are cheaper than day-old bread and it is forbidden to help a slave escape.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no slave.\u201d\n\u201cEvery man ever taken by slavers sings that same sad song. I dare not help you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0here.\u201d She leaned forward again. \u201cTwo days from now, the cog Selaesori Qhoran will set sail for Qarth by way of New Ghis, carrying tin and iron, bales of wool and lace, fifty Myrish carpets, a corpse pickled in brine, twenty jars of dragon peppers, and a red priest. Be on her when she sails.\u201d\n\u201cWe will,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cand thank you.\u201d\nSer Jorah frowned. \u201cQarth is not our destination.\u201d\n\u201cShe will never reach Qarth. Benerro has seen it in his fires.\u201d The crone smiled a vulpine smile.\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d Tyrion grinned. \u201cIf I were Volantene, and free, and had the blood, you\u2019d have my vote for triarch, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cI am no lady,\u201d the widow replied, \u201cjust Vogarro\u2019s whore. You want to be gone from here before the tigers come. Should you reach your queen, give her a message from the slaves of Old Volantis.\u201d She touched the faded scar upon her wrinkled cheek, where her tears had been cut away. \u201cTell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon.\u201d",

      "content": "JON\nWhen he heard the order, Ser Alliser\u2019s mouth twisted into a semblance of a smile, but his eyes remained as cold and hard as flint. \u201cSo the bastard boy sends me out to die.\u201d\n\u201cDie,\u201d cried Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cDie, die, die.\u201d\nYou are not helping. Jon swatted the bird away. \u201cThe bastard boy is sending you out to range. To find our foes and kill them if need be. You are skilled with a blade. You were master-at-arms, here and at Eastwatch.\u201d\nThorne touched the hilt of his longsword. \u201cAye. I have squandered a third of my life trying to teach the rudiments of swordplay to churls, muttonheads, and knaves. Small good that will do me in those woods.\u201d\n\u201cDywen will be with you, and another seasoned ranger.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll learn you what you need t\u2019 know, ser,\u201d Dywen told Thorne, cackling. \u201cTeach you how t\u2019 wipe your highborn arse with leaves, just like a proper ranger.\u201d\nKedge Whiteye laughed at that, and Black Jack Bulwer spat. Ser Alliser only said, \u201cYou would like me to refuse. Then you could hack off my head, same as you did for Slynt. I\u2019ll not give you that pleasure, bastard. You\u2019d best pray that it\u2019s a wildling blade that kills me, though. The ones the Others kill don\u2019t stay dead\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and they remember. I\u2019m coming back, Lord Snow.\u201d\n\u201cI pray you do.\u201d Jon would never count Ser Alliser Thorne amongst his friends, but he was still a brother. No one ever said you had to like your brothers.\nIt was no easy thing to send men into the wild, knowing that the chances were good that they might never return. They are all seasoned men, Jon told himself\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but his uncle Benjen and his rangers had been seasoned men as well, and the haunted forest had swallowed them up without a trace. When two of them finally came straggling back to the Wall, it had been as wights. Not for the first time, or the last, Jon Snow found himself wondering what had become of Benjen Stark. Perhaps the rangers will come upon some sign of them, he told himself, never truly believing it.\nDywen would lead one ranging, Black Jack Bulwer and Kedge Whiteye the other two. They at least were eager for the duty. \u201cFeels good to have a horse under me again,\u201d Dywen said at the gate, sucking on his wooden teeth. \u201cBegging your pardon, m\u2019lord, but we were all o\u2019 us getting splinters up our arses from sitting about.\u201d No man in Castle Black knew the woods as well as Dywen did, the trees and streams, the plants that could be eaten, the ways of predator and prey. Thorne is in better hands than he deserves.\nJon watched the riders go from atop the Wall\u2014three parties, each of three men, each carrying a pair of ravens. From on high their garrons looked no larger than ants, and Jon could not tell one ranger from another. He knew them, though. Every name was graven on his heart. Eight good men, he thought, and one\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, we shall see.\nWhen the last of the riders had disappeared into the trees, Jon Snow rode the winch cage down with Dolorous Edd. A few scattered snowflakes were falling as they made their slow descent, dancing on the gusty wind. One followed the cage down, drifting just beyond the bars. It was falling faster than they were descending and from time to time would vanish beneath them. Then a gust of wind would catch it and push it upward once again. Jon could have reached through the bars and caught it if he had wished.\n\u201cI had a frightening dream last night, m\u2019lord,\u201d Dolorous Edd confessed. \u201cYou were my steward, fetching my food and cleaning up my leavings. I was lord commander, with never a moment\u2019s peace.\u201d\nJon did not smile. \u201cYour nightmare, my life.\u201d\nCotter Pyke\u2019s galleys were reporting ever-increasing numbers of free folk along the wooded shores to the north and east of the Wall. Camps had been seen, half-built rafts, even the hull of a broken cog that someone had begun repairing. The wildlings always vanished into the woods when seen, no doubt to reemerge as soon as Pyke\u2019s ships had passed. Meanwhile, Ser Denys Mallister was still seeing fires in the night north of the Gorge. Both commanders were asking for more men.\nAnd where am I to get more men? Jon had sent ten of the Mole\u2019s Town wildlings to each of them: green boys, old men, some wounded and infirm, but all capable of doing work of one sort or another. Far from being pleased, Pyke and Mallister had both written back to complain. \u201cWhen I asked for men, I had in mind men of the Night\u2019s Watch, trained and disciplined, whose loyalty I should never have reason to doubt,\u201d wrote Ser Denys. Cotter Pyke was blunter. \u201cI could hang them from the Wall as a warning to other wildlings to stay away, but I don\u2019t see any other use for them,\u201d Maester Harmune wrote for him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust such to clean my chamber pot, and ten is not enough.\u201d\nThe iron cage moved downward at the end of its long chain, creaking and rattling, until it finally jerked to a halt a foot above the ground at the base of the Wall. Dolorous Edd pushed open the door and hopped down, his boots breaking the crust of the last snow. Jon followed.\nOutside the armory, Iron Emmett was still urging on his charges in the yard. The song of steel on steel woke a hunger in Jon. It reminded him of warmer, simpler days, when he had been a boy at Winterfell matching blades with Robb under the watchful eye of Ser Rodrik Cassel. Ser Rodrik too had fallen, slain by Theon Turncloak and his ironmen as he\u2019d tried to retake Winterfell. The great stronghold of House Stark was a scorched desolation. All my memories are poisoned.\nWhen Iron Emmett spied him, he raised a hand and combat ceased. \u201cLord Commander. How may we serve you?\u201d\n\u201cWith your three best.\u201d\nEmmett grinned. \u201cArron. Emrick. Jace.\u201d\nHorse and Hop-Robin fetched padding for the lord commander, along with a ringmail hauberk to go over it, and greaves, gorget, and halfhelm. A black shield rimmed with iron for his left arm, a blunted longsword for his right hand. The sword gleamed silvery grey in the dawn light, almost new. One of the last to come from Donal\u2019s forge. A pity he did not live long enough to put an edge on it. The blade was shorter than Longclaw but made of common steel, which made it heavier. His blows would be a little slower. \u201cIt will serve.\u201d Jon turned to face his foes. \u201cCome.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one do you want first?\u201d asked Arron.\n\u201cAll three of you. At once.\u201d\n\u201cThree on one?\u201d Jace was incredulous. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d He was one of Conwy\u2019s latest bunch, a cobbler\u2019s son from Fair Isle. Maybe that explained it.\n\u201cTrue. Come here.\u201d\nWhen he did, Jon\u2019s blade slammed him alongside his head, knocking him off his feet. In the blink of an eye the boy had a boot on his chest and a swordpoint at his throat. \u201cWar is never fair,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cIt\u2019s two on one now, and you\u2019re dead.\u201d\nWhen he heard gravel crunch, he knew the twins were coming. Those two will make rangers yet. He spun, blocking Arron\u2019s cut with the edge of his shield and meeting Emrick\u2019s with his sword. \u201cThose aren\u2019t spears,\u201d he shouted. \u201cGet in close.\u201d He went to the attack to show them how it was done. Emrick first. He slashed at his head and shoulders, right and left and right again. The boy got his shield up and tried a clumsy countercut. Jon slammed his own shield into Emrick\u2019s, and brought him down with a blow to the lower leg\u00a0\u2026\u00a0none too soon, because Arron was on him, with a crunching cut to the back of his thigh that sent him to one knee. That will leave a bruise. He caught the next cut on his shield, then lurched back to his feet and drove Arron across the yard. He\u2019s quick, he thought, as the longswords kissed once and twice and thrice, but he needs to get stronger. When he saw relief in Arron\u2019s eyes, he knew Emrick was behind him. He came around and dealt him a cut to the back of the shoulders that sent him crashing into his brother. By that time Jace had found his feet, so Jon put him down again. \u201cI hate it when dead men get up. You\u2019ll feel the same the day you meet a wight.\u201d Stepping back, he lowered his sword.\n\u201cThe big crow can peck the little crows,\u201d growled a voice behind him, \u201cbut has he belly enough to fight a man?\u201d\nRattleshirt was leaning against a wall. A coarse stubble covered his sunken cheeks, and thin brown hair was blowing across his little yellow eyes.\n\u201cYou flatter yourself,\u201d Jon said.\n\u201cAye, but I\u2019d flatten you.\u201d\n\u201cStannis burned the wrong man.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The wildling grinned at him through a mouth of brown and broken teeth. \u201cHe burned the man he had to burn, for all the world to see. We all do what we have to do, Snow. Even kings.\u201d\n\u201cEmmett, find some armor for him. I want him in steel, not old bones.\u201d\nOnce clad in mail and plate, the Lord of Bones seemed to stand a little straighter. He seemed taller too, his shoulders thicker and more powerful than Jon would have thought. It\u2019s the armor, not the man, he told himself. Even Sam could appear almost formidable, clad head to heel in Donal Noye\u2019s steel. The wildling waved away the shield Horse offered him. Instead he asked for a two-handed sword. \u201cThere\u2019s a sweet sound,\u201d he said, slashing at the air. \u201cFlap closer, Snow. I mean to make your feathers fly.\u201d\nJon rushed him hard.\nRattleshirt took a step backwards and met the charge with a two-handed slash. If Jon had not interposed his shield, it might have staved his breastplate in and broken half his ribs. The force of the blow staggered him for a moment and sent a solid jolt up his arm. He hits harder than I would have thought. His quickness was another unpleasant surprise. They circled round each other, trading blow for blow. The Lord of Bones gave as good as he was getting. By rights the two-handed greatsword should have been a deal more cumbersome than Jon\u2019s longsword, but the wildling wielded it with blinding speed.\nIron Emmett\u2019s fledglings cheered their lord commander at the start, but the relentless speed of Rattleshirt\u2019s attack soon beat them down to silence. He cannot keep this up for long, Jon told himself as he stopped another blow. The impact made him grunt. Even dulled, the greatsword cracked his pinewood shield and bent the iron rim. He will tire soon. He must. Jon slashed at the wildling\u2019s face, and Rattleshirt pulled back his head. He hacked down at Rattleshirt\u2019s calf, only to have him deftly leap the blade. The greatsword crashed down onto Jon\u2019s shoulder, hard enough to ding his pouldron and numb the arm beneath. Jon backed away. The Lord of Bones came after, chortling. He has no shield, Jon reminded himself, and that monster sword\u2019s too cumbersome for parries. I should be landing two blows for every one of his.\nSomehow he wasn\u2019t, though, and the blows he did land were having no effect. The wildling always seemed to be moving away or sliding sideways, so Jon\u2019s longsword glanced off a shoulder or an arm. Before long he found himself giving more ground, trying to avoid the other\u2019s crashing cuts and failing half the time. His shield had been reduced to kindling. He shook it off his arm. Sweat was running down his face and stinging his eyes beneath his helm. He is too strong and too quick, he realized, and with that greatsword he has weight and reach on me. It would have been a different fight if Jon had been armed with Longclaw, but\u00a0\u2026\nHis chance came on Rattleshirt\u2019s next backswing. Jon threw himself forward, bulling into the other man, and they went down together, legs entangled. Steel slammed on steel. Both men lost their swords as they rolled on the hard ground. The wildling drove a knee between Jon\u2019s legs. Jon lashed out with a mailed fist. Somehow Rattleshirt ended up on top, with Jon\u2019s head in his hands. He smashed it against the ground, then wrenched his visor open. \u201cIf I had me a dagger, you\u2019d be less an eye by now,\u201d he snarled, before Horse and Iron Emmett dragged him off the lord commander\u2019s chest. \u201cLet go o\u2019 me, you bloody crows,\u201d he roared.\nJon struggled to one knee. His head was ringing, and his mouth was full of blood. He spat it out and said, \u201cWell fought.\u201d\n\u201cYou flatter yourself, crow. I never broke a sweat.\u201d\n\u201cNext time you will,\u201d said Jon. Dolorous Edd helped him to his feet and unbuckled his helm. It had acquired several deep dents that had not been there when he\u2019d donned it. \u201cRelease him.\u201d Jon tossed the helm to Hop-Robin, who dropped it.\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d said Iron Emmett, \u201che threatened your life, we all heard. He said that if he had a dagger\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe does have a dagger. Right there on his belt.\u201d There is always someone quicker and stronger, Ser Rodrik had once told Jon and Robb. He\u2019s the man you want to face in the yard before you need to face his like upon a battlefield.\n\u201cLord Snow?\u201d a soft voice said.\nHe turned to find Clydas standing beneath the broken archway, a parchment in his hand. \u201cFrom Stannis?\u201d Jon had been hoping for some word from the king. The Night\u2019s Watch took no part, he knew, and it should not matter to him which king emerged triumphant. Somehow it did. \u201cIs it Deepwood?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d Clydas thrust the parchment forward. It was tightly rolled and sealed, with a button of hard pink wax. Only the Dreadfort uses pink sealing wax. Jon ripped off his gauntlet, took the letter, cracked the seal. When he saw the signature, he forgot the battering Rattleshirt had given him.\nRamsay Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, it read, in a huge, spiky hand. The brown ink came away in flakes when Jon brushed it with his thumb. Beneath Bolton\u2019s signature, Lord Dustin, Lady Cerwyn, and four Ryswells had appended their own marks and seals. A cruder hand had drawn the giant of House Umber. \u201cMight we know what it says, my lord?\u201d asked Iron Emmett.\nJon saw no reason not to tell him. \u201cMoat Cailin is taken. The flayed corpses of the ironmen have been nailed to posts along the kingsroad. Roose Bolton summons all leal lords to Barrowton, to affirm their loyalty to the Iron Throne and celebrate his son\u2019s wedding to\u00a0\u2026\u201d His heart seemed to stop for a moment. No, that is not possible. She died in King\u2019s Landing, with Father.\n\u201cLord Snow?\u201d Clydas peered at him closely with his dim pink eyes. \u201cAre you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0unwell? You seem\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s to marry Arya Stark. My little sister.\u201d Jon could almost see her in that moment, long-faced and gawky, all knobby knees and sharp elbows, with her dirty face and tangled hair. They would wash the one and comb the other, he did not doubt, but he could not imagine Arya in a wedding gown, nor Ramsay Bolton\u2019s bed. No matter how afraid she is, she will not show it. If he tries to lay a hand on her, she\u2019ll fight him.\n\u201cYour sister,\u201d Iron Emmett said, \u201chow old is\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nBy now she\u2019d be eleven, Jon thought. Still a child. \u201cI have no sister. Only brothers. Only you.\u201d Lady Catelyn would have rejoiced to hear those words, he knew. That did not make them easier to say. His fingers closed around the parchment. Would that they could crush Ramsay Bolton\u2019s throat as easily.\nClydas cleared his throat. \u201cWill there be an answer?\u201d\nJon shook his head and walked away.\nBy nightfall the bruises that Rattleshirt had given him had turned purple. \u201cThey\u2019ll go yellow before they fade away,\u201d he told Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cI\u2019ll look as sallow as the Lord of Bones.\u201d\n\u201cBones,\u201d the bird agreed. \u201cBones, bones.\u201d\nHe could hear the faint murmur of voices coming from outside, although the sound was too weak to make out words. They sound a thousand leagues away. It was Lady Melisandre and her followers at their nightfire. Every night at dusk the red woman led her followers in their twilight prayer, asking her red god to see them through the dark. For the night is dark and full of terrors. With Stannis and most of the queen\u2019s men gone, her flock was much diminished; half a hundred of the free folk up from Mole\u2019s Town, the handful of guards the king had left her, perhaps a dozen black brothers who had taken her red god for their own.\nJon felt as stiff as a man of sixty years. Dark dreams, he thought, and guilt. His thoughts kept returning to Arya. There is no way I can help her. I put all kin aside when I said my words. If one of my men told me his sister was in peril, I would tell him that was no concern of his. Once a man had said the words his blood was black. Black as a bastard\u2019s heart. He\u2019d had Mikken make a sword for Arya once, a bravo\u2019s blade, made small to fit her hand. Needle. He wondered if she still had it. Stick them with the pointy end, he\u2019d told her, but if she tried to stick the Bastard, it could mean her life.\n\u201cSnow,\u201d muttered Lord Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cSnow, snow.\u201d\nSuddenly he could not suffer it a moment longer.\nHe found Ghost outside his door, gnawing on the bone of an ox to get at the marrow. \u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d The direwolf got to his feet, abandoning the bone to come padding after Jon.\nMully and Kegs stood inside the doors, leaning on their spears. \u201cA cruel cold out there, m\u2019lord,\u201d warned Mully through his tangled orange beard. \u201cWill you be out long?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I just need a breath of air.\u201d Jon stepped out into the night. The sky was full of stars, and the wind was gusting along the Wall. Even the moon looked cold; there were goosebumps all across its face. Then the first gust caught him, slicing through his layers of wool and leather to set his teeth to chattering. He stalked across the yard, into the teeth of that wind. His cloak flapped loudly from his shoulders. Ghost came after. Where am I going? What am I doing? Castle Black was still and silent, its halls and towers dark. My seat, Jon Snow reflected. My hall, my home, my command. A ruin.\nIn the shadow of the Wall, the direwolf brushed up against his fingers. For half a heartbeat the night came alive with a thousand smells, and Jon Snow heard the crackle of the crust breaking on a patch of old snow. Someone was behind him, he realized suddenly. Someone who smelled warm as a summer day.\nWhen he turned he saw Ygritte.\nShe stood beneath the scorched stones of the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower, cloaked in darkness and in memory. The light of the moon was in her hair, her red hair kissed by fire. When he saw that, Jon\u2019s heart leapt into his mouth. \u201cYgritte,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLord Snow.\u201d The voice was Melisandre\u2019s.\nSurprise made him recoil from her. \u201cLady Melisandre.\u201d He took a step backwards. \u201cI mistook you for someone else.\u201d At night all robes are grey. Yet suddenly hers were red. He did not understand how he could have taken her for Ygritte. She was taller, thinner, older, though the moonlight washed years from her face. Mist rose from her nostrils, and from pale hands naked to the night. \u201cYou will freeze your fingers off,\u201d Jon warned.\n\u201cIf that is the will of R\u2019hllor. Night\u2019s powers cannot touch one whose heart is bathed in god\u2019s holy fire.\u201d\n\u201cYou heart does not concern me. Just your hands.\u201d\n\u201cThe heart is all that matters. Do not despair, Lord Snow. Despair is a weapon of the enemy, whose name may not be spoken. Your sister is not lost to you.\u201d\n\u201cI have no sister.\u201d The words were knives. What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?\nMelisandre seemed amused. \u201cWhat is her name, this little sister that you do not have?\u201d\n\u201cArya.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cMy half-sister, truly\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0for you are bastard born. I had not forgotten. I have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\u201d She gazed at Ghost. \u201cMay I touch your\u00a0\u2026\u00a0wolf?\u201d\nThe thought made Jon uneasy. \u201cBest not.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not harm me. You call him Ghost, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGhost.\u201d Melisandre made the word a song.\nThe direwolf padded toward her. Wary, he stalked about her in a circle, sniffing. When she held out her hand he smelled that too, then shoved his nose against her fingers.\nJon let out a white breath. \u201cHe is not always so\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0warm? Warmth calls to warmth, Jon Snow.\u201d Her eyes were two red stars, shining in the dark. At her throat, her ruby gleamed, a third eye glowing brighter than the others. Jon had seen Ghost\u2019s eyes blazing red the same way, when they caught the light just right. \u201cGhost,\u201d he called. \u201cTo me.\u201d\nThe direwolf looked at him as if he were a stranger.\nJon frowned in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0\u2026\u00a0queer.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d She knelt and scratched Ghost behind his ear. \u201cYour Wall is a queer place, but there is power here, if you will use it. Power in you, and in this beast. You resist it, and that is your mistake. Embrace it. Use it.\u201d\nI am not a wolf, he thought. \u201cAnd how would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cI can show you.\u201d Melisandre draped one slender arm over Ghost, and the direwolf licked her face. \u201cThe Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.\u201d\n\u201cShadows.\u201d The world seemed darker when he said it.\n\u201cEvery man who walks the earth casts a shadow on the world. Some are thin and weak, others long and dark. You should look behind you, Lord Snow. The moon has kissed you and etched your shadow upon the ice twenty feet tall.\u201d\nJon glanced over his shoulder. The shadow was there, just as she had said, etched in moonlight against the Wall. A girl in grey on a dying horse, he thought. Coming here, to you. Arya. He turned back to the red priestess. Jon could feel her warmth. She has power. The thought came unbidden, seizing him with iron teeth, but this was not a woman he cared to be indebted to, not even for his little sister. \u201cDalla told me something once. Val\u2019s sister, Mance Rayder\u2019s wife. She said that sorcery was a sword without a hilt. There is no safe way to grasp it.\u201d\n\u201cA wise woman.\u201d Melisandre rose, her red robes stirring in the wind. \u201cA sword without a hilt is still a sword, though, and a sword is a fine thing to have when foes are all about. Hear me now, Jon Snow. Nine crows flew into the white wood to find your foes for you. Three of them are dead. They have not died yet, but their death is out there waiting for them, and they ride to meet it. You sent them forth to be your eyes in the darkness, but they will be eyeless when they return to you. I have seen their pale dead faces in my flames. Empty sockets, weeping blood.\u201d She pushed her red hair back, and her red eyes shone. \u201cYou do not believe me. You will. The cost of that belief will be three lives. A small price to pay for wisdom, some might say\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not one you had to pay. Remember that when you behold the blind and ravaged faces of your dead. And come that day, take my hand.\u201d The mist rose from her pale flesh, and for a moment it seemed as if pale, sorcerous flames were playing about her fingers. \u201cTake my hand,\u201d she said again, \u201cand let me save your sister.\u201d",

      "content": "DAVOS\nEven in the gloom of the Wolf\u2019s Den, Davos Seaworth could sense that something was awry this morning.\nHe woke to the sound of voices and crept to the door of his cell, but the wood was too thick and he could not make out the words. Dawn had come, but not the porridge Garth brought him every morn to break his fast. That made him anxious. All the days were much the same inside the Wolf\u2019s Den, and any change was usually for the worse. This may be the day I die. Garth may be sitting with a whetstone even now, to put an edge on Lady Lu.\nThe onion knight had not forgotten Wyman Manderly\u2019s last words to him. Take this creature to the Wolf\u2019s Den and cut off head and hands, the fat lord had commanded. I shall not be able to eat a bite until I see this smuggler\u2019s head upon a spike, with an onion shoved between his lying teeth. Every night Davos went to sleep with those words in his head, and every morn he woke to them. And should he forget, Garth was always pleased to remind him. Dead man was his name for Davos. When he came by in the morning, it was always, \u201cHere, porridge for the dead man.\u201d At night it was, \u201cBlow out the candle, dead man.\u201d\nOnce Garth brought his ladies by to introduce them to the dead man. \u201cThe Whore don\u2019t look like much,\u201d he said, fondling a rod of cold black iron, \u201cbut when I heat her up red-hot and let her touch your cock, you\u2019ll cry for mother. And this here\u2019s my Lady Lu. It\u2019s her who\u2019ll take your head and hands, when Lord Wyman sends down word.\u201d Davos had never seen a bigger axe than Lady Lu, nor one with a sharper edge. Garth spent his days honing her, the other keepers said. I will not plead for mercy, Davos resolved. He would go to his death a knight, asking only that they take his head before his hands. Even Garth would not be so cruel as to deny him that, he hoped.\nThe sounds coming through the door were faint and muffled. Davos rose and paced his cell. As cells went, it was large and queerly comfortable. He suspected it might once have been some lordling\u2019s bedchamber. It was thrice the size of his captain\u2019s cabin on Black Bessa, and even larger than the cabin Salladhor Saan enjoyed on his Valyrian. Though its only window had been bricked in years before, one wall still boasted a hearth big enough to hold a kettle, and there was an actual privy built into a corner nook. The floor was made of warped planks full of splinters, and his sleeping pallet smelled of mildew, but those discomforts were mild compared to what Davos had expected.\nThe food had come as a surprise as well. In place of gruel and stale bread and rotten meat, the usual dungeon fare, his keepers brought him fresh-caught fish, bread still warm from the oven, spiced mutton, turnips, carrots, even crabs. Garth was none too pleased by that. \u201cThe dead should not eat better than the living,\u201d he complained, more than once. Davos had furs to keep him warm by night, wood to feed his fire, clean clothing, a greasy tallow candle. When he asked for paper, quill, and ink, Therry brought them the next day. When he asked for a book, so he might keep at his reading, Therry turned up with The Seven-Pointed Star.\nFor all its comforts, though, his cell remained a cell. Its walls were solid stone, so thick that he could hear nothing of the outside world. The door was oak and iron, and his keepers kept it barred. Four sets of heavy iron fetters dangled from the ceiling, waiting for the day Lord Manderly decided to chain him up and give him over to the Whore. Today may be that day. The next time Garth opens my door, it may not be to bring me porridge.\nHis belly was rumbling, a sure sign that the morning was creeping past, and still no sign of food. The worst part is not the dying, it\u2019s not knowing when or how. He had seen the inside of a few gaols and dungeons in his smuggling days, but those he\u2019d shared with other prisoners, so there was always someone to talk with, to share your fears and hopes. Not here. Aside from his keepers, Davos Seaworth had the Wolf\u2019s Den to himself.\nHe knew there were true dungeons down in the castle cellars\u2014oubliettes and torture chambers and dank pits where huge black rats scrabbled in the darkness. His gaolers claimed all of them were unoccupied at present. \u201cOnly us here, Onion,\u201d Ser Bartimus had told him. He was the chief gaoler, a cadaverous one-legged knight, with a scarred face and a blind eye. When Ser Bartimus was in his cups (and Ser Bartimus was in his cups most every day), he liked to boast of how he had saved Lord Wyman\u2019s life at the Battle of the Trident. The Wolf\u2019s Den was his reward.\nThe rest of \u201cus\u201d consisted of a cook Davos never saw, six guardsmen in the ground-floor barracks, a pair of washerwomen, and the two turnkeys who looked after the prisoner. Therry was the young one, the son of one of the washerwomen, a boy of ten-and-four. The old one was Garth, huge and bald and taciturn, who wore the same greasy leather jerkin every day and always seemed to have a glower on his face.\nHis years as a smuggler had given Davos Seaworth a sense of when a man was wrong, and Garth was wrong. The onion knight took care to hold his tongue in Garth\u2019s presence. With Therry and Ser Bartimus he was less reticent. He thanked them for his food, encouraged them to talk about their hopes and histories, answered their questions politely, and never pressed too hard with queries of his own. When he made requests, they were small ones: a basin of water and a bit of soap, a book to read, more candles. Most such favors were granted, and Davos was duly grateful.\nNeither man would speak about Lord Manderly or King Stannis or the Freys, but they would talk of other things. Therry wanted to go off to war when he was old enough, to fight in battles and become a knight. He liked to complain about his mother too. She was bedding two of the guardsmen, he confided. The men were on different watches and neither knew about the other, but one day one man or t\u2019other would puzzle it out, and then there would be blood. Some nights the boy would even bring a skin of wine to the cell and ask Davos about the smuggler\u2019s life as they drank.\nSer Bartimus had no interest in the world outside, or indeed anything that had happened since he lost his leg to a riderless horse and a maester\u2019s saw. He had come to love the Wolf\u2019s Den, however, and liked nothing more than to talk about its long and bloody history. The Den was much older than White Harbor, the knight told Davos. It had been raised by King Jon Stark to defend the mouth of the White Knife against raiders from the sea. Many a younger son of the King in the North had made his seat there, many a brother, many an uncle, many a cousin. Some passed the castle to their own sons and grandsons, and offshoot branches of House Stark had arisen; the Greystarks had lasted the longest, holding the Wolf\u2019s Den for five centuries, until they presumed to join the Dreadfort in rebellion against the Starks of Winterfell.\nAfter their fall, the castle had passed through many other hands. House Flint held it for a century, House Locke for almost two. Slates, Longs, Holts, and Ashwoods had held sway here, charged by Winterfell to keep the river safe. Reavers from the Three Sisters took the castle once, making it their toehold in the north. During the wars between Winterfell and the Vale, it was besieged by Osgood Arryn, the Old Falcon, and burned by his son, the one remembered as the Talon. When old King Edrick Stark had grown too feeble to defend his realm, the Wolf\u2019s Den was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. They would brand their captives with hot irons and break them to the whip before shipping them off across the sea, and these same black stone walls bore witness.\n\u201cThen a long cruel winter fell,\u201d said Ser Bartimus. \u201cThe White Knife froze hard, and even the firth was icing up. The winds came howling from the north and drove them slavers inside to huddle round their fires, and whilst they warmed themselves the new king come down on them. Brandon Stark this was, Edrick Snowbeard\u2019s great-grandson, him that men called Ice Eyes. He took the Wolf\u2019s Den back, stripped the slavers naked, and gave them to the slaves he\u2019d found chained up in the dungeons. It\u2019s said they hung their entrails in the branches of the heart tree, as an offering to the gods. The old gods, not these new ones from the south. Your Seven don\u2019t know winter, and winter don\u2019t know them.\u201d\nDavos could not argue with the truth of that. From what he had seen at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, he did not care to know winter either. \u201cWhat gods do you keep?\u201d he asked the one-legged knight.\n\u201cThe old ones.\u201d When Ser Bartimus grinned, he looked just like a skull. \u201cMe and mine were here before the Manderlys. Like as not, my own forebears strung those entrails through the tree.\u201d\n\u201cI never knew that northmen made blood sacrifice to their heart trees.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s much and more you southrons do not know about the north,\u201d Ser Bartimus replied.\nHe was not wrong. Davos sat beside his candle and looked at the letters he had scratched out word by word during the days of his confinement. I was a better smuggler than a knight, he had written to his wife, a better knight than a King\u2019s Hand, a better King\u2019s Hand than a husband. I am so sorry. Marya, I have loved you. Please forgive the wrongs I did you. Should Stannis lose his war, our lands will be lost as well. Take the boys across the narrow sea to Braavos and teach them to think kindly of me, if you would. Should Stannis gain the Iron Throne, House Seaworth will survive and Devan will remain at court. He will help you place the other boys with noble lords, where they can serve as pages and squires and win their knighthoods. It was the best counsel he had for her, though he wished it sounded wiser.\nHe had written to each of his three surviving sons as well, to help them remember the father who had bought them names with his fingertips. His notes to Steffon and young Stannis were short and stiff and awkward; if truth be told, he did not know them half as well as he had his older boys, the ones who\u2019d burned or drowned upon the Blackwater. To Devan he wrote more, telling him how proud he was to see his own son as a king\u2019s squire and reminding him that as the eldest it was his duty to protect his lady mother and his younger brothers. Tell His Grace I did my best, he ended. I am sorry that I failed him. I lost my luck when I lost my fingerbones, the day the river burned below King\u2019s Landing.\nDavos shuffled through the letters slowly, reading each one over several times, wondering whether he should change a word here or add one there. A man should have more to say when staring at the end of his life, he thought, but the words came hard. I did not do so ill, he tried to tell himself. I rose up from Flea Bottom to be a King\u2019s Hand, and I learned to read and write.\nHe was still hunched over the letters when he heard the sound of iron keys rattling on a ring. Half a heartbeat later, the door to his cell came swinging open.\nThe man who stepped through the door was not one of his gaolers. He was tall and haggard, with a deeply lined face and a shock of grey-brown hair. A longsword hung from his hip, and his deep-dyed scarlet cloak was fastened at the shoulder with a heavy silver brooch in the shape of a mailed fist. \u201cLord Seaworth,\u201d he said, \u201cwe do not have much time. Please, come with me.\u201d\nDavos eyed the stranger warily. The \u201cplease\u201d confused him. Men about to lose their heads and hands were not oft accorded such courtesies. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cRobett Glover, if it please, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cGlover. Your seat was Deepwood Motte.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother Galbart\u2019s seat. It was and is, thanks to your King Stannis. He has taken Deepwood back from the iron bitch who stole it and offers to restore it to its rightful owners. Much and more has happened whilst you have been confined within these walls, Lord Davos. Moat Cailin has fallen, and Roose Bolton has returned to the north with Ned Stark\u2019s younger daughter. A host of Freys came with him. Bolton has sent forth ravens, summoning all the lords of the north to Barrowton. He demands homage and hostages\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and witnesses to the wedding of Arya Stark and his bastard Ramsay Snow, by which match the Boltons mean to lay claim to Winterfell. Now, will you come with me, or no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat choice do I have, my lord? Come with you, or remain with Garth and Lady Lu?\u201d\n\u201cWho is Lady Lu? One of the washerwomen?\u201d Glover was growing impatient. \u201cAll will be explained if you will come.\u201d\nDavos rose to his feet. \u201cIf I should die, I beseech my lord to see that my letters are delivered.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my word on that\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though if you die, it will not be at Glover\u2019s hands, nor Lord Wyman\u2019s. Quickly now, with me.\u201d\nGlover led him along a darkened hall and down a flight of worn steps. They crossed the castle\u2019s godswood, where the heart tree had grown so huge and tangled that it had choked out all the oaks and elms and birch and sent its thick, pale limbs crashing through the walls and windows that looked down on it. Its roots were as thick around as a man\u2019s waist, its trunk so wide that the face carved into it looked fat and angry. Beyond the weirwood, Glover opened a rusted iron gate and paused to light a torch. When it was blazing red and hot, he took Davos down more steps into a barrel-vaulted cellar where the weeping walls were crusted white with salt, and seawater sloshed beneath their feet with every step. They passed through several cellars, and rows of small, damp, foul-smelling cells very different from the room where Davos had been confined. Then there was a blank stone wall that turned when Glover pushed on it. Beyond was a long narrow tunnel and still more steps. These led up.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d asked Davos as they climbed. His words echoed faintly though the darkness.\n\u201cThe steps beneath the steps. The passage runs beneath the Castle Stair up to the New Castle. A secret way. It would not do for you to be seen, my lord. You are supposed to be dead.\u201d\nPorridge for the dead man. Davos climbed.\nThey emerged through another wall, but this one was lath and plaster on the far side. The room beyond was snug and warm and comfortably furnished, with a Myrish carpet on the floor and beeswax candles burning on a table. Davos could hear pipes and fiddles playing, not far away. On the wall hung a sheepskin with a map of the north painted across it in faded colors. Beneath the map sat Wyman Manderly, the colossal Lord of White Harbor.\n\u201cPlease sit.\u201d Lord Manderly was richly garbed. His velvet doublet was a soft blue-green, embroidered with golden thread at hem and sleeves and collar. His mantle was ermine, pinned at the shoulder with a golden trident. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lord. Your gaolers have fed me well.\u201d\n\u201cThere is wine, if you have a thirst.\u201d\n\u201cI will treat with you, my lord. My king commanded that of me. I do not have to drink with you.\u201d\nLord Wyman sighed. \u201cI have treated you most shamefully, I know. I had my reasons, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please, sit and drink, I beg you. Drink to my boy\u2019s safe return. Wylis, my eldest son and heir. He is home. That is the welcoming feast you hear. In the Merman\u2019s Court they are eating lamprey pie and venison with roasted chestnuts. Wynafryd is dancing with the Frey she is to marry. The other Freys are raising cups of wine to toast our friendship.\u201d\nBeneath the music, Davos could hear the murmur of many voices, the clatter of cups and platters. He said nothing.\n\u201cI have just come from the high table,\u201d Lord Wyman went on. \u201cI have eaten too much, as ever, and all White Harbor knows my bowels are bad. My friends of Frey will not question a lengthy visit to the privy, we hope.\u201d He turned his cup over. \u201cThere. You will drink and I will not. Sit. Time is short, and there is much we need to say. Robett, wine for the Hand, if you will be so good. Lord Davos, you will not know, but you are dead.\u201d\nRobett Glover filled a wine cup and offered it to Davos. He took it, sniffed it, drank. \u201cHow did I die, if I may ask?\u201d\n\u201cBy the axe. Your head and hands were mounted above the Seal Gate, with your face turned so your eyes looked out across the harbor. By now you are well rotted, though we dipped your head in tar before we set it upon the spike. Carrion crows and seabirds squabbled over your eyes, they say.\u201d\nDavos shifted uncomfortably. It was a queer feeling, being dead. \u201cIf it please my lord, who died in my place?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter? You have a common face, Lord Davos. I hope my saying so does not offend you. The man had your coloring, a nose of the same shape, two ears that were not dissimilar, a long beard that could be trimmed and shaped like yours. You can be sure we tarred him well, and the onion shoved between his teeth served to twist the features. Ser Bartimus saw that the fingers of his left hand were shortened, the same as yours. The man was a criminal, if that gives you any solace. His dying may accomplish more good than anything he ever did whilst living. My lord, I bear you no ill will. The rancor I showed you in the Merman\u2019s Court was a mummer\u2019s farce put on to please our friends of Frey.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord should take up a life of mummery,\u201d said Davos. \u201cYou and yours were most convincing. Your good-daughter seemed to want me dead most earnestly, and the little girl\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWylla.\u201d Lord Wyman smiled. \u201cDid you see how brave she was? Even when I threatened to have her tongue out, she reminded me of the debt White Harbor owes to the Starks of Winterfell, a debt that can never be repaid. Wylla spoke from the heart, as did Lady Leona. Forgive her if you can, my lord. She is a foolish, frightened woman, and Wylis is her life. Not every man has it in him to be Prince Aemon the Dragonknight or Symeon Star-Eyes, and not every woman can be as brave as my Wylla and her sister Wynafryd\u00a0\u2026\u00a0who did know, yet played her own part fearlessly.\n\u201cWhen treating with liars, even an honest man must lie. I did not dare defy King\u2019s Landing so long as my last living son remained a captive. Lord Tywin Lannister wrote me himself to say that he had Wylis. If I would have him freed unharmed, he told me, I must repent my treason, yield my city, declare my loyalty to the boy king on the Iron Throne\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and bend my knee to Roose Bolton, his Warden of the North. Should I refuse, Wylis would die a traitor\u2019s death, White Harbor would be stormed and sacked, and my people would suffer the same fate as the Reynes of Castamere.\n\u201cI am fat, and many think that makes me weak and foolish. Mayhaps Tywin Lannister was one such. I sent him back a raven to say that I would bend my knee and open my gates after my son was returned, but not before. There the matter stood when Tywin died. Afterward the Freys turned up with Wendel\u2019s bones\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to make a peace and seal it with a marriage pact, they claimed, but I was not about to give them what they wanted until I had Wylis, safe and whole, and they were not about to give me Wylis until I proved my loyalty. Your arrival gave me the means to do that. That was the reason for the discourtesy I showed you in the Merman\u2019s Court, and for the head and hands rotting above the Seal Gate.\u201d\n\u201cYou took a great risk, my lord,\u201d Davos said. \u201cIf the Freys had seen through your deception\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI took no risk at all. If any of the Freys had taken it upon themselves to climb my gate for a close look at the man with the onion in his mouth, I would have blamed my gaolers for the error and produced you to appease them.\u201d\nDavos felt a shiver up his spine. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so. You have sons of your own, you said.\u201d\nThree, thought Davos, though I fathered seven.\n\u201cSoon I must return to the feast to toast my friends of Frey,\u201d Manderly continued. \u201cThey watch me, ser. Day and night their eyes are on me, noses sniffing for some whiff of treachery. You saw them, the arrogant Ser Jared and his nephew Rhaegar, that smirking worm who wears a dragon\u2019s name. Behind them both stands Symond, clinking coins. That one has bought and paid for several of my servants and two of my knights. One of his wife\u2019s handmaids has found her way into the bed of my own fool. If Stannis wonders that my letters say so little, it is because I dare not even trust my maester. Theomore is all head and no heart. You heard him in my hall. Maesters are supposed to put aside old loyalties when they don their chains, but I cannot forget that Theomore was born a Lannister of Lannisport and claims some distant kinship to the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Foes and false friends are all around me, Lord Davos. They infest my city like roaches, and at night I feel them crawling over me.\u201d The fat man\u2019s fingers coiled into a fist, and all his chins trembled. \u201cMy son Wendel came to the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder\u2019s bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. Murdered, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but never think that means I have forgotten. The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer\u2019s farce is almost done. My son is home.\u201d\nSomething about the way Lord Wyman said that chilled Davos to the bone. \u201cIf it is justice that you want, my lord, look to King Stannis. No man is more just.\u201d\nRobett Glover broke in to add, \u201cYour loyalty does you honor, my lord, but Stannis Baratheon remains your king, not our own.\u201d\n\u201cYour own king is dead,\u201d Davos reminded them, \u201cmurdered at the Red Wedding beside Lord Wyman\u2019s son.\u201d\n\u201cThe Young Wolf is dead,\u201d Manderly allowed, \u201cbut that brave boy was not Lord Eddard\u2019s only son. Robett, bring the lad.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, my lord.\u201d Glover slipped out the door.\nThe lad? Was it possible that one of Robb Stark\u2019s brothers had survived the ruin of Winterfell? Did Manderly have a Stark heir hidden away in his castle? A found boy or a feigned boy? The north would rise for either, he suspected\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Stannis Baratheon would never make common cause with an imposter.\nThe lad who followed Robett Glover through the door was not a Stark, nor could he ever hope to pass for one. He was older than the Young Wolf\u2019s murdered brothers, fourteen or fifteen by the look of him, and his eyes were older still. Beneath a tangle of dark brown hair his face was almost feral, with a wide mouth, sharp nose, and pointed chin. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Davos asked.\nThe boy looked to Robett Glover.\n\u201cHe is a mute, but we have been teaching him his letters. He learns quickly.\u201d Glover drew a dagger from his belt and gave it to the boy. \u201cWrite your name for Lord Seaworth.\u201d\nThere was no parchment in the chamber. The boy carved the letters into a wooden beam in the wall. W\u00a0\u2026\u00a0E\u00a0\u2026\u00a0X. He leaned hard into the X. When he was done he flipped the dagger in the air, caught it, and stood admiring his handiwork.\n\u201cWex is ironborn. He was Theon Greyjoy\u2019s squire. Wex was at Winterfell.\u201d Glover sat. \u201cHow much does Lord Stannis know of what transpired at Winterfell?\u201d\nDavos thought back on the tales they\u2019d heard. \u201cWinterfell was captured by Theon Greyjoy, who had once been Lord Stark\u2019s ward. He had Stark\u2019s two young sons put to death and mounted their heads above the castle walls. When the northmen came to oust him, he put the entire castle to sword, down to the last child, before he himself was slain by Lord Bolton\u2019s bastard.\u201d\n\u201cNot slain,\u201d said Glover. \u201cCaptured, and carried back to the Dreadfort. The Bastard has been flaying him.\u201d\nLord Wyman nodded. \u201cThe tale you tell is one we all have heard, as full of lies as a pudding\u2019s full of raisins. It was the Bastard of Bolton who put Winterfell to the sword\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ramsay Snow, he was called then, before the boy king made him a Bolton. Snow did not kill them all. He spared the women, roped them together, and marched them to the Dreadfort for his sport.\u201d\n\u201cHis sport?\u201d\n\u201cHe is a great hunter,\u201d said Wyman Manderly, \u201cand women are his favorite prey. He strips them naked and sets them loose in the woods. They have a half day\u2019s start before he sets out after them with hounds and horns. From time to time some wench escapes and lives to tell the tale. Most are less fortunate. When Ramsay catches them he rapes them, flays them, feeds their corpses to his dogs, and brings their skins back to the Dreadfort as trophies. If they have given him good sport, he slits their throats before he skins them. Elsewise, t\u2019other way around.\u201d\nDavos paled. \u201cGods be good. How could any man\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe evil is in his blood,\u201d said Robett Glover. \u201cHe is a bastard born of rape. A Snow, no matter what the boy king says.\u201d\n\u201cWas ever snow so black?\u201d asked Lord Wyman. \u201cRamsay took Lord Hornwood\u2019s lands by forcibly wedding his widow, then locked her in a tower and forgot her. It is said she ate her own fingers in her extremity\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the Lannister notion of king\u2019s justice is to reward her killer with Ned Stark\u2019s little girl.\u201d\n\u201cThe Boltons have always been as cruel as they were cunning, but this one seems a beast in human skin,\u201d said Glover.\nThe Lord of White Harbor leaned forward. \u201cThe Freys are no better. They speak of wargs and skinchangers and assert that it was Robb Stark who slew my Wendel. The arrogance of it! They do not expect the north to believe their lies, not truly, but they think we must pretend to believe or die. Roose Bolton lies about his part in the Red Wedding, and his bastard lies about the fall of Winterfell. And yet so long as they held Wylis I had no choice but to eat all this excrement and praise the taste.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now, my lord?\u201d asked Davos.\nHe had hoped to hear Lord Wyman say, And now I shall declare for King Stannis, but instead the fat man smiled an odd, twinkling smile and said, \u201cAnd now I have a wedding to attend. I am too fat to sit a horse, as any man with eyes can plainly see. As a boy I loved to ride, and as a young man I handled a mount well enough to win some small acclaim in the lists, but those days are done. My body has become a prison more dire than the Wolf\u2019s Den. Even so, I must go to Winterfell. Roose Bolton wants me on my knees, and beneath the velvet courtesy he shows the iron mail. I shall go by barge and litter, attended by a hundred knights and my good friends from the Twins. The Freys came here by sea. They have no horses with them, so I shall present each of them with a palfrey as a guest gift. Do hosts still give guest gifts in the south?\u201d\n\u201cSome do, my lord. On the day their guest departs.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you understand, then.\u201d Wyman Manderly lurched ponderously to his feet. \u201cI have been building warships for more than a year. Some you saw, but there are as many more hidden up the White Knife. Even with the losses I have suffered, I still command more heavy horse than any other lord north of the Neck. My walls are strong, and my vaults are full of silver. Oldcastle and Widow\u2019s Watch will take their lead from me. My bannermen include a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights. I can deliver King Stannis the allegiance of all the lands east of the White Knife, from Widow\u2019s Watch and Ramsgate to the Sheepshead Hills and the headwaters of the Broken Branch. All this I pledge to do if you will meet my price.\u201d\n\u201cI can bring your terms to the king, but\u2014\u201d\nLord Wyman cut him off. \u201cIf you will meet my price, I said. Not Stannis. It\u2019s not a king I need but a smuggler.\u201d\nRobett Glover took up the tale. \u201cWe may never know all that happened at Winterfell, when Ser Rodrik Cassel tried to take the castle back from Theon Greyjoy\u2019s ironmen. The Bastard of Bolton claims that Greyjoy murdered Ser Rodrik during a parley. Wex says no. Until he learns more letters we will never know half the truth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he came to us knowing yes and no, and those can go a long way once you find the right questions.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the Bastard who murdered Ser Rodrik and the men of Winterfell,\u201d said Lord Wyman. \u201cHe slew Greyjoy\u2019s ironmen as well. Wex saw men cut down trying to yield. When we asked how he escaped, he took a chunk of chalk and drew a tree with a face.\u201d\nDavos thought about that. \u201cThe old gods saved him?\u201d\n\u201cAfter a fashion. He climbed the heart tree and hid himself amongst the leaves. Bolton\u2019s men searched the godswood twice and killed the men they found there, but none thought to clamber up into the trees. Is that how it happened, Wex?\u201d\nThe boy flipped up Glover\u2019s dagger, caught it, nodded.\nGlover said, \u201cHe stayed up in the tree a long time. He slept amongst the branches, not daring to descend. Finally he heard voices down beneath him.\u201d\n\u201cThe voices of the dead,\u201d said Wyman Manderly.\nWex held up five fingers, tapped each one with the dagger, then folded four away and tapped the last again.\n\u201cSix of them,\u201d asked Davos. \u201cThere were six.\u201d\n\u201cTwo of them Ned Stark\u2019s murdered sons.\u201d\n\u201cHow could a mute tell you that?\u201d\n\u201cWith chalk. He drew two boys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and two wolves.\u201d\n\u201cThe lad is ironborn, so he thought it best not to show himself,\u201d said Glover. \u201cHe listened. The six did not linger long amongst the ruins of Winterfell. Four went one way, two another. Wex stole after the two, a woman and a boy. He must have stayed downwind, so the wolf would not catch his scent.\u201d\n\u201cHe knows where they went,\u201d Lord Wyman said.\nDavos understood. \u201cYou want the boy.\u201d\n\u201cRoose Bolton has Lord Eddard\u2019s daughter. To thwart him White Harbor must have Ned\u2019s son\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the direwolf. The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, should the Dreadfort attempt to deny him. That is my price, Lord Davos. Smuggle me back my liege lord, and I will take Stannis Baratheon as my king.\u201d\nOld instinct made Davos Seaworth reach for his throat. His fingerbones had been his luck, and somehow he felt he would have need of luck to do what Wyman Manderly was asking of him. The bones were gone, though, so he said, \u201cYou have better men than me in your service. Knights and lords and maesters. Why would you need a smuggler? You have ships.\u201d\n\u201cShips,\u201d Lord Wyman agreed, \u201cbut my crews are rivermen, or fisherfolk who have never sailed beyond the Bite. For this I must have a man who\u2019s sailed in darker waters and knows how to slip past dangers, unseen and unmolested.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is the boy?\u201d Somehow Davos knew he would not like the answer. \u201cWhere is it you want me to go, my lord?\u201d\nRobett Glover said, \u201cWex. Show him.\u201d\nThe mute flipped the dagger, caught it, then flung it end over end at the sheepskin map that adorned Lord Wyman\u2019s wall. It struck quivering. Then he grinned.\nFor half a heartbeat Davos considered asking Wyman Manderly to send him back to the Wolf\u2019s Den, to Ser Bartimus with his tales and Garth with his lethal ladies. In the Den even prisoners ate porridge in the morning. But there were other places in this world where men were known to break their fast on human flesh.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nEach morning, from her western ramparts, the queen would count the sails on Slaver\u2019s Bay.\nToday she counted five-and-twenty, though some were far away and moving, so it was hard to be certain. Sometimes she missed one, or counted one twice. What does it matter? A strangler only needs ten fingers. All trade had stopped, and her fisherfolk did not dare put out into the bay. The boldest still dropped a few lines into the river, though even that was hazardous; more remained tied up beneath Meereen\u2019s walls of many-colored brick.\nThere were ships from Meereen out in the bay too, warships and trading galleys whose captains had taken them to sea when Dany\u2019s host first laid siege to the city, now returned to augment the fleets from Qarth, Tolos, and New Ghis.\nHer admiral\u2019s counsel had proved worse than useless. \u201cLet them see your dragons,\u201d Groleo said. \u201cLet the Yunkishmen have a taste of fire, and the trade will flow again.\u201d\n\u201cThose ships are strangling us, and all my admiral can do is talk of dragons,\u201d Dany said. \u201cYou are my admiral, are you not?\u201d\n\u201cAn admiral without ships.\u201d\n\u201cBuild ships.\u201d\n\u201cWarships cannot be made from brick. The slavers burned every stand of timber within twenty leagues of here.\u201d\n\u201cThen ride out two-and-twenty leagues. I will give you wagons, workers, mules, whatever you require.\u201d\n\u201cI am a sailor, not a shipwright. I was sent to fetch Your Grace back to Pentos. Instead you brought us here and tore my Saduleon to pieces for some nails and scraps of wood. I will never see her like again. I may never see my home again, nor my old wife. It was not me who refused the ships this Daxos offered. I cannot fight the Qartheen with fishing boats.\u201d\nHis bitterness dismayed her, so much so that Dany found herself wondering if the grizzled Pentoshi could be one of her three betrayers. No, he is only an old man, far from home and sick at heart. \u201cThere must be something we can do.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and I\u2019ve told you what. These ships are made of rope and pitch and canvas, of Qohorik pine and teak from Sothoros, old oak from Great Norvos, yew and ash and spruce. Wood, Your Grace. Wood burns. The dragons\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will hear no more about my dragons. Leave me. Go pray to your Pentoshi gods for a storm to sink our foes.\u201d\n\u201cNo sailor prays for storms, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cI am tired of hearing what you will not do. Go.\u201d\nSer Barristan remained. \u201cOur stores are ample for the moment,\u201d he reminded her, \u201cand Your Grace has planted beans and grapes and wheat. Your Dothraki have harried the slavers from the hills and struck the shackles from their slaves. They are planting too, and will be bringing their crops to Meereen to market. And you will have the friendship of Lhazar.\u201d\nDaario won that for me, for all that it is worth. \u201cThe Lamb Men. Would that lambs had teeth.\u201d\n\u201cThat would make the wolves more cautious, no doubt.\u201d\nThat made her laugh. \u201cHow fare your orphans, ser?\u201d\nThe old knight smiled. \u201cWell, Your Grace. It is good of you to ask.\u201d The boys were his pride. \u201cFour or five have the makings of knights. Perhaps as many as a dozen.\u201d\n\u201cOne would be enough if he were as true as you.\u201d The day might come soon when she would have need of every knight. \u201cWill they joust for me? I should like that.\u201d Viserys had told her stories of the tourneys he had witnessed in the Seven Kingdoms, but Dany had never seen a joust herself.\n\u201cThey are not ready, Your Grace. When they are, they will be pleased to demonstrate their prowess.\u201d\n\u201cI hope that day comes quickly.\u201d She would have kissed her good knight on the cheek, but just then Missandei appeared beneath the arched doorway. \u201cMissandei?\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace. Skahaz awaits your pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cSend him up.\u201d\nThe Shavepate was accompanied by two of his Brazen Beasts. One wore a hawk mask, the other the likeness of a jackal. Only their eyes could be seen behind the brass. \u201cYour Radiance, Hizdahr was seen to enter the pyramid of Zhak last evening. He did not depart until well after dark.\u201d\n\u201cHow many pyramids has he visited?\u201d asked Dany.\n\u201cEleven.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how long since the last murder?\u201d\n\u201cSix-and-twenty days.\u201d The Shavepate\u2019s eyes brimmed with fury. It had been his notion to have the Brazen Beasts follow her betrothed and take note of all his actions.\n\u201cSo far Hizdahr has made good on his promises.\u201d\n\u201cHow? The Sons of the Harpy have put down their knives, but why? Because the noble Hizdahr asked sweetly? He is one of them, I tell you. That\u2019s why they obey him. He may well be the Harpy.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is a Harpy.\u201d Skahaz was convinced that somewhere in Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general commanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief. The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the Harpy\u2019s Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when questioned sharply\u00a0\u2026\u00a0too many names, it seemed to her. It would have been pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who might be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My enemies are legion. \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends. And he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or convinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests.\u201d\n\u201cIf he is not the Harpy, he knows him. I can find the truth of that easy enough. Give me your leave to put Hizdahr to the question, and I will bring you a confession.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not trust these confessions. You\u2019ve brought me too many of them, all of them worthless.\u201d\n\u201cYour Radiance\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I said.\u201d\nThe Shavepate\u2019s scowl turned his ugly face even uglier. \u201cA mistake. The Great Master Hizdahr plays Your Worship for a fool. Do you want a serpent in your bed?\u201d\nI want Daario in my bed, but I sent him away for the sake of you and yours. \u201cYou may continue to watch Hizdahr zo Loraq, but no harm is to come to him. Is that understood?\u201d\n\u201cI am not deaf, Magnificence. I will obey.\u201d Skahaz drew a parchment scroll from his sleeve. \u201cYour Worship should have a look at this. A list of all the Meereenese ships in the blockade, with their captains. Great Masters all.\u201d\nDany studied the scroll. All the ruling families of Meereen were named: Hazkar, Merreq, Quazzar, Zhak, Rhazdar, Ghazeen, Pahl, even Reznak and Loraq. \u201cWhat am I to do with a list of names?\u201d\n\u201cEvery man on that list has kin within the city. Sons and brothers, wives and daughters, mothers and fathers. Let my Brazen Beasts seize them. Their lives will win you back those ships.\u201d\n\u201cIf I send the Brazen Beasts into the pyramids, it will mean open war inside the city. I have to trust in Hizdahr. I have to hope for peace.\u201d Dany held the parchment above a candle and watched the names go up in flame, while Skahaz glowered at her.\nAfterward, Ser Barristan told her that her brother Rhaegar would have been proud of her. Dany remembered the words Ser Jorah had spoken at Astapor: Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.\nWhen she descended to the purple marble hall, she found it almost empty. \u201cAre there no petitioners today?\u201d Dany asked Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cNo one who craves justice or silver for a sheep?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Your Worship. The city is afraid.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing to fear.\u201d\nBut there was much and more to fear as she learned that evening. As her young hostages Miklaz and Kezmya were laying out a simple supper of autumn greens and ginger soup for her, Irri came to tell her that Galazza Galare had returned, with three Blue Graces from the temple. \u201cGrey Worm is come as well, Khaleesi. They beg words with you, most urgently.\u201d\n\u201cBring them to my hall. And summon Reznak and Skahaz. Did the Green Grace say what this was about?\u201d\n\u201cAstapor,\u201d said Irri.\nGrey Worm began the tale. \u201cHe came out of the morning mists, a rider on a pale horse, dying. His mare was staggering as she approached the city gates, her sides pink with blood and lather, her eyes rolling with terror. Her rider called out, \u2018She is burning, she is burning,\u2019 and fell from the saddle. This one was sent for, and gave orders that the rider be brought to the Blue Graces. When your servants carried him inside the gates, he cried out again, \u2018She is burning.\u2019 Under his tokar he was a skeleton, all bones and fevered flesh.\u201d\nOne of the Blue Graces took up the tale from there. \u201cThe Unsullied brought this man to the temple, where we stripped him and bathed him in cool water. His clothes were soiled, and my sisters found half an arrow in his thigh. Though he had broken off the shaft, the head remained inside him, and the wound had mortified, filling him with poisons. He died within the hour, still crying out that she was burning.\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018She is burning,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Daenerys repeated. \u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\u201cAstapor, Your Radiance,\u201d said another of the Blue Graces. \u201cHe said it, once. He said \u2018Astapor is burning.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cIt might have been his fever talking.\u201d\n\u201cYour Radiance speaks wisely,\u201d said Galazza Galare, \u201cbut Ezzara saw something else.\u201d\nThe Blue Grace called Ezzara folded her hands. \u201cMy queen,\u201d she murmured, \u201chis fever was not brought on by the arrow. He had soiled himself, not once but many times. The stains reached to his knees, and there was dried blood amongst his excrement.\u201d\n\u201cHis horse was bleeding, Grey Worm said.\u201d\n\u201cThis thing is true, Your Grace,\u201d the eunuch confirmed. \u201cThe pale mare was bloody from his spur.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so, Your Radiance,\u201d said Ezzara, \u201cbut this blood was mingled with his stool. It stained his smallclothes.\u201d\n\u201cHe was bleeding from the bowels,\u201d said Galazza Galare.\n\u201cWe cannot be certain,\u201d said Ezzara, \u201cbut it may be that Meereen has more to fear than the spears of the Yunkai\u2019i.\u201d\n\u201cWe must pray,\u201d said the Green Grace. \u201cThe gods sent this man to us. He comes as a harbinger. He comes as a sign.\u201d\n\u201cA sign of what?\u201d asked Dany.\n\u201cA sign of wroth and ruin.\u201d\nShe did not want to believe that. \u201cHe was one man. One sick man with an arrow in his leg. A horse brought him here, not a god.\u201d A pale mare. Dany rose abruptly. \u201cI thank you for your counsel and for all that you did for this poor man.\u201d\nThe Green Grace kissed Dany\u2019s fingers before she took her leave. \u201cWe shall pray for Astapor.\u201d\nAnd for me. Oh, pray for me, my lady. If Astapor had fallen, nothing remained to prevent Yunkai from turning north.\nShe turned to Ser Barristan. \u201cSend riders into the hills to find my bloodriders. Recall Brown Ben and the Second Sons as well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Stormcrows, Your Grace?\u201d\nDaario. \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Just three nights ago she had dreamed of Daario lying dead beside the road, staring sightlessly into the sky as crows quarreled above his corpse. Other nights she tossed in her bed, imagining that he\u2019d betrayed her, as he had once betrayed his fellow captains in the Stormcrows. He brought me their heads. What if he had taken his company back to Yunkai, to sell her for a pot of gold? He would not do that. Would he? \u201cThe Stormcrows too. Send riders after them at once.\u201d\nThe Second Sons were the first to return, eight days after the queen sent forth her summons. When Ser Barristan told her that her captain desired words with her, she thought for a moment that it was Daario, and her heart leapt. But the captain that he spoke of was Brown Ben Plumm.\nBrown Ben had a seamed and weathered face, skin the color of old teak, white hair, and wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Dany was so pleased to see his leathery brown face that she hugged him. His eyes crinkled in amusement. \u201cI heard talk Your Grace was going to take a husband,\u201d he said, \u201cbut no one told me it was me.\u201d They laughed together as Reznak sputtered, but the laughter ceased when Brown Ben said, \u201cWe caught three Astapori. Your Worship had best hear what they say.\u201d\n\u201cBring them.\u201d\nDaenerys received them in the grandeur of her hall as tall candles burned amongst the marble pillars. When she saw that the Astapori were half-starved, she sent for food at once. These three were all that remained of a dozen who had set out together from the Red City: a bricklayer, a weaver, and a cobbler. \u201cWhat befell the rest of your party?\u201d the queen asked.\n\u201cSlain,\u201d said the cobbler. \u201cYunkai\u2019s sellswords roam the hills north of Astapor, hunting down those who flee the flames.\u201d\n\u201cHas the city fallen, then? Its walls were thick.\u201d\n\u201cThis is so,\u201d said the bricklayer, a stoop-backed man with rheumy eyes, \u201cbut they were old and crumbling as well.\u201d\nThe weaver raised her head. \u201cEvery day we told each other that the dragon queen was coming back.\u201d The woman had thin lips and dull dead eyes, set in a pinched and narrow face. \u201cCleon had sent for you, it was said, and you were coming.\u201d\nHe sent for me, thought Dany. That much is true, at least.\n\u201cOutside our walls, the Yunkai\u2019i devoured our crops and slaughtered our herds,\u201d the cobbler went on. \u201cInside we starved. We ate cats and rats and leather. A horsehide was a feast. King Cutthroat and Queen Whore accused each other of feasting on the flesh of the slain. Men and women gathered in secret to draw lots and gorge upon the flesh of him who drew the black stone. The pyramid of Nakloz was despoiled and set aflame by those who claimed that Kraznys mo Nakloz was to blame for all our woes.\u201d\n\u201cOthers blamed Daenerys,\u201d said the weaver, \u201cbut more of us still loved you. \u2018She is on her way,\u2019 we said to one another. \u2018She is coming at the head of a great host, with food for all.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nI can scarce feed my own folk. If I had marched to Astapor, I would have lost Meereen.\nThe cobbler told them how the body of the Butcher King had been disinterred and clad in copper armor, after the Green Grace of Astapor had a vision that he would deliver them from the Yunkai\u2019i. Armored and stinking, the corpse of Cleon the Great was strapped onto the back of a starving horse to lead the remnants of his new Unsullied on a sortie, but they rode right into the iron teeth of a legion from New Ghis and were cut down to a man.\n\u201cAfterward the Green Grace was impaled upon a stake in the Plaza of Punishment and left until she died. In the pyramid of Ullhor, the survivors had a great feast that lasted half the night, and washed the last of their food down with poison wine so none need wake again come morning. Soon after came the sickness, a bloody flux that killed three men of every four, until a mob of dying men went mad and slew the guards on the main gate.\u201d\nThe old brickmaker broke in to say, \u201cNo. That was the work of healthy men, running to escape the flux.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d asked the cobbler. \u201cThe guards were torn apart and the gates thrown open. The legions of New Ghis came pouring into Astapor, followed by the Yunkai\u2019i and the sellswords on their horses. Queen Whore died fighting them with a curse upon her lips. King Cutthroat yielded and was thrown into a fighting pit, to be torn apart by a pack of starving dogs.\u201d\n\u201cEven then some said that you were coming,\u201d said the weaver. \u201cThey swore they had seen you mounted on a dragon, flying high above the camps of the Yunkai\u2019i. Every day we looked for you.\u201d\nI could not come, the queen thought. I dare not.\n\u201cAnd when the city fell?\u201d demanded Skahaz. \u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cThe butchery began. The Temple of the Graces was full of the sick who had come to ask the gods to heal them. The legions sealed the doors and set the temple ablaze with torches. Within the hour fires were burning in every corner of the city. As they spread they joined with one another. The streets were full of mobs, running this way and that to escape the flames, but there was no way out. The Yunkai\u2019i held the gates.\u201d\n\u201cYet you escaped,\u201d the Shavepate said. \u201cHow is that?\u201d\nThe old man answered. \u201cI am by trade a brickmaker, as my father and his father were before me. My grandfather built our house up against the city walls. It was an easy thing to work loose a few bricks every night. When I told my friends, they helped me shore up the tunnel so it would not collapse. We all agreed that it might be good to have our own way out.\u201d\nI left you with a council to rule over you, Dany thought, a healer, a scholar, and a priest. She could still recall the Red City as she had first seen it, dry and dusty behind its red brick walls, dreaming cruel dreams, yet full of life. There were islands in the Worm where lovers kissed, but in the Plaza of Punishment they peeled the skin off men in strips and left them hanging naked for the flies. \u201cIt is good that you have come,\u201d she told the Astapori. \u201cYou will be safe in Meereen.\u201d\nThe cobbler thanked her for that, and the old brickmaker kissed her foot, but the weaver looked at her with eyes as hard as slate. She knows I lie, the queen thought. She knows I cannot keep them safe. Astapor is burning, and Meereen is next.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more coming,\u201d Brown Ben announced when the Astapori had been led away. \u201cThese three had horses. Most are afoot.\u201d\n\u201cHow many are they?\u201d asked Reznak.\nBrown Ben shrugged. \u201cHundreds. Thousands. Some sick, some burned, some wounded. The Cats and the Windblown are swarming through the hills with lance and lash, driving them north and cutting down the laggards.\u201d\n\u201cMouths on feet. And sick, you say?\u201d Reznak wrung his hands. \u201cYour Worship must not allow them in the city.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm. \u201cI\u2019m no maester, mind you, but I know you got to keep the bad apples from the good.\u201d\n\u201cThese are not apples, Ben,\u201d said Dany. \u201cThese are men and women, sick and hungry and afraid.\u201d My children. \u201cI should have gone to Astapor.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace could not have saved them,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cYou warned King Cleon against this war with Yunkai. The man was a fool, and his hands were red with blood.\u201d\nAnd are my hands any cleaner? She remembered what Daario had said\u2014that all kings must be butchers, or meat. \u201cCleon was the enemy of our enemy. If I had joined him at the Horns of Hazzat, we might have crushed the Yunkai\u2019i between us.\u201d\nThe Shavepate disagreed. \u201cIf you had taken the Unsullied south to Hazzat, the Sons of the Harpy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know. It is Eroeh all over again.\u201d\nBrown Ben Plumm was puzzled. \u201cWho is Eroeh?\u201d\n\u201cA girl I thought I\u2019d saved from rape and torment. All I did was make it worse for her in the end. And all I did in Astapor was make ten thousand Eroehs.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace could not have known\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am the queen. It was my place to know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is done is done,\u201d said Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cYour Worship, I beg you, take the noble Hizdahr for your king at once. He can speak with the Wise Masters, make a peace for us.\u201d\n\u201cOn what terms?\u201d Beware the perfumed seneschal, Quaithe had said. The masked woman had foretold the coming of the pale mare, was she right about the noble Reznak too? \u201cI may be a young girl innocent of war, but I am not a lamb to walk bleating into the harpy\u2019s den. I still have my Unsullied. I have the Stormcrows and the Second Sons. I have three companies of freedmen.\u201d\n\u201cThem, and dragons,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm, with a grin.\n\u201cIn the pit, in chains,\u201d wailed Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cWhat good are dragons that cannot be controlled? Even the Unsullied grow fearful when they must open the doors to feed them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, o\u2019 the queen\u2019s little pets?\u201d Brown Ben\u2019s eyes crinkled in amusement. The grizzled captain of the Second Sons was a creature of the free companies, a mongrel with the blood of a dozen different peoples flowing through his veins, but he had always been fond of the dragons, and them of him.\n\u201cPets?\u201d screeched Reznak. \u201cMonsters, rather. Monsters that feed on children. We cannot\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSilence,\u201d said Daenerys. \u201cWe will not speak of that.\u201d\nReznak shrank away from her, flinching from the fury in her tone. \u201cForgive me, Magnificence, I did not\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nBrown Ben Plumm bulled over him. \u201cYour Grace, the Yunkish got three free companies against our two, and there\u2019s talk the Yunkishmen sent to Volantis to fetch back the Golden Company. Those bastards field ten thousand. Yunkai\u2019s got four Ghiscari legions too, maybe more, and I heard it said they sent riders across the Dothraki sea to maybe bring some big khalasar down on us. We need them dragons, the way I see it.\u201d\nDany sighed. \u201cI am sorry, Ben. I dare not loose the dragons.\u201d She could see that was not the answer that he wanted.\nPlumm scratched at his speckled whiskers. \u201cIf there\u2019s no dragons in the balance, well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we should leave before them Yunkish bastards close the trap\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only first, make the slavers pay to see our backs. They pay the khals to leave their cities be, why not us? Sell Meereen back to them and start west with wagons full o\u2019 gold and gems and such.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to loot Meereen and flee? No, I will not do that. Grey Worm, are my freedmen ready for battle?\u201d\nThe eunuch crossed his arms against his chest. \u201cThey are not Unsullied, but they will not shame you. This one will swear to that by spear and sword, Your Worship.\u201d\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d Daenerys looked at the faces of the men around her. The Shavepate, scowling. Ser Barristan, with his lined face and sad blue eyes. Reznak mo Reznak, pale, sweating. Brown Ben, white-haired, grizzled, tough as old leather. Grey Worm, smooth-cheeked, stolid, expressionless. Daario should be here, and my bloodriders, she thought. If there is to be a battle, the blood of my blood should be with me. She missed Ser Jorah Mormont too. He lied to me, informed on me, but he loved me too, and he always gave good counsel. \u201cI defeated the Yunkai\u2019i before. I will defeat them again. Where, though? How?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to take the field?\u201d The Shavepate\u2019s voice was thick with disbelief. \u201cThat would be folly. Our walls are taller and thicker than the walls of Astapor, and our defenders are more valiant. The Yunkai\u2019i will not take this city easily.\u201d\nSer Barristan disagreed. \u201cI do not think we should allow them to invest us. Theirs is a patchwork host at best. These slavers are no soldiers. If we take them unawares\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSmall chance of that,\u201d the Shavepate said. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i have many friends inside the city. They will know.\u201d\n\u201cHow large an army can we muster?\u201d Dany asked.\n\u201cNot large enough, begging your royal pardon,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm. \u201cWhat does Naharis have to say? If we\u2019re going to make a fight o\u2019 this, we need his Stormcrows.\u201d\n\u201cDaario is still in the field.\u201d Oh, gods, what have I done? Have I sent him to his death? \u201cBen, I will need your Second Sons to scout our enemies. Where they are, how fast they are advancing, how many men they have, and how they are disposed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need provisions. Fresh horses too.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Ser Barristan will see to it.\u201d\nBrown Ben scratched his chin. \u201cMight be we could get some o\u2019 them to come over. If Your Grace could spare a few bags o\u2019 gold and gems\u00a0\u2026\u00a0just to give their captains a good taste, as it were\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, who knows?\u201d\n\u201cBuy them, why not?\u201d Dany said. That sort of thing went on all the time amongst the free companies of the Disputed Lands, she knew. \u201cYes, very good. Reznak, see to it. Once the Second Sons ride out, close the gates and double the watch upon the walls.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall be done, Magnificence,\u201d said Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cWhat of these Astapori?\u201d\nMy children. \u201cThey are coming here for help. For succor and protection. We cannot turn our backs on them.\u201d\nSer Barristan frowned. \u201cYour Grace, I have known the bloody flux to destroy whole armies when left to spread unchecked. The seneschal is right. We cannot have the Astapori in Meereen.\u201d\nDany looked at him helplessly. It was good that dragons did not cry. \u201cAs you say, then. We will keep them outside the walls until this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this curse has run its course. Set up a camp for them beside the river, west of the city. We will send them what food we can. Perhaps we can separate the healthy from the sick.\u201d All of them were looking at her. \u201cWill you make me say it twice? Go and do as I\u2019ve commanded you.\u201d Dany rose, brushed past Brown Ben, and climbed the steps to the sweet solitude of her terrace.\nTwo hundred leagues divided Meereen from Astapor, yet it seemed to her that the sky was darker to the southwest, smudged and hazy with the smoke of the Red City\u2019s passing. Brick and blood built Astapor, and brick and blood its people. The old rhyme rang in her head. Ash and bone is Astapor, and ash and bone its people. She tried to recall Eroeh\u2019s face, but the dead girl\u2019s features kept turning into smoke.\nWhen Daenerys finally turned away, Ser Barristan stood near her, wrapped in his white cloak against the chill of evening. \u201cCan we make a fight of this?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cMen can always fight, Your Grace. Ask rather if we can win. Dying is easy, but victory comes hard. Your freedmen are half-trained and unblooded. Your sellswords once served your foes, and once a man turns his cloak he will not scruple to turn it again. You have two dragons who cannot be controlled, and a third that may be lost to you. Beyond these walls your only friends are the Lhazarene, who have no taste for war.\u201d\n\u201cMy walls are strong, though.\u201d\n\u201cNo stronger than when we sat outside them. And the Sons of the Harpy are inside the walls with us. So are the Great Masters, both those you did not kill and the sons of those you did.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d The queen sighed. \u201cWhat do you counsel, ser?\u201d\n\u201cBattle,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cMeereen is overcrowded and full of hungry mouths, and you have too many enemies within. We cannot long withstand a siege, I fear. Let me meet the foe as he comes north, on ground of my own choosing.\u201d\n\u201cMeet the foe,\u201d she echoed, \u201cwith the freedmen you\u2019ve called half-trained and unblooded.\u201d\n\u201cWe were all unblooded once, Your Grace. The Unsullied will help stiffen them. If I had five hundred knights\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOr five. And if I give you the Unsullied, I will have no one but the Brazen Beasts to hold Meereen.\u201d When Ser Barristan did not dispute her, Dany closed her eyes. Gods, she prayed, you took Khal Drogo, who was my sun-and-stars. You took our valiant son before he drew a breath. You have had your blood of me. Help me now, I pray you. Give me the wisdom to see the path ahead and the strength to do what I must to keep my children safe.\nThe gods did not respond.\nWhen she opened her eyes again, Daenerys said, \u201cI cannot fight two enemies, one within and one without. If I am to hold Meereen, I must have the city behind me. The whole city. I need\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I need\u00a0\u2026\u201d She could not say it.\n\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Ser Barristan prompted, gently.\nA queen belongs not to herself but to her people.\n\u201cI need Hizdahr zo Loraq.\u201d",

      "content": "MELISANDRE\nIt was never truly dark in Melisandre\u2019s chambers.\nThree tallow candles burned upon her windowsill to keep the terrors of the night at bay. Four more flickered beside her bed, two to either side. In the hearth a fire was kept burning day and night. The first lesson those who would serve her had to learn was that the fire must never, ever be allowed to go out.\nThe red priestess closed her eyes and said a prayer, then opened them once more to face the hearthfire. One more time. She had to be certain. Many a priest and priestess before her had been brought down by false visions, by seeing what they wished to see instead of what the Lord of Light had sent. Stannis was marching south into peril, the king who carried the fate of the world upon his shoulders, Azor Ahai reborn. Surely R\u2019hllor would vouchsafe her a glimpse of what awaited him. Show me Stannis, Lord, she prayed. Show me your king, your instrument.\nVisions danced before her, gold and scarlet, flickering, forming and melting and dissolving into one another, shapes strange and terrifying and seductive. She saw the eyeless faces again, staring out at her from sockets weeping blood. Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths. Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. Through curtains of fire great winged shadows wheeled against a hard blue sky.\nThe girl. I must find the girl again, the grey girl on the dying horse. Jon Snow would expect that of her, and soon. It would not be enough to say the girl was fleeing. He would want more, he would want the when and where, and she did not have that for him. She had seen the girl only once. A girl as grey as ash, and even as I watched she crumbled and blew away.\nA face took shape within the hearth. Stannis? she thought, for just a moment\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no, these were not his features. A wooden face, corpse white. Was this the enemy? A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames. He sees me. Beside him, a boy with a wolf\u2019s face threw back his head and howled.\nThe red priestess shuddered. Blood trickled down her thigh, black and smoking. The fire was inside her, an agony, an ecstasy, filling her, searing her, transforming her. Shimmers of heat traced patterns on her skin, insistent as a lover\u2019s hand. Strange voices called to her from days long past. \u201cMelony,\u201d she heard a woman cry. A man\u2019s voice called, \u201cLot Seven.\u201d She was weeping, and her tears were flame. And still she drank it in.\nSnowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and dead things shambled silent through the cold, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained.\nDeath, thought Melisandre. The skulls are death.\nThe flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name Jon Snow. His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a shadow half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again. But the skulls were here as well, the skulls were all around him. Melisandre had seen his danger before, had tried to warn the boy of it. Enemies all around him, daggers in the dark. He would not listen.\nUnbelievers never listened until it was too late.\n\u201cWhat do you see, my lady?\u201d the boy asked, softly.\nSkulls. A thousand skulls, and the bastard boy again. Jon Snow. Whenever she was asked what she saw within her fires, Melisandre would answer, \u201cMuch and more,\u201d but seeing was never as simple as those words suggested. It was an art, and like all arts it demanded mastery, discipline, study. Pain. That too. R\u2019hllor spoke to his chosen ones through blessed fire, in a language of ash and cinder and twisting flame that only a god could truly grasp. Melisandre had practiced her art for years beyond count, and she had paid the price. There was no one, even in her order, who had her skill at seeing the secrets half-revealed and half-concealed within the sacred flames.\nYet now she could not even seem to find her king. I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R\u2019hllor shows me only Snow. \u201cDevan,\u201d she called, \u201ca drink.\u201d Her throat was raw and parched.\n\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d The boy poured her a cup of water from the stone jug by the window and brought it to her.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Melisandre took a sip, swallowed, and gave the boy a smile. That made him blush. The boy was half in love with her, she knew. He fears me, he wants me, and he worships me.\nAll the same, Devan was not pleased to be here. The lad had taken great pride in serving as a king\u2019s squire, and it had wounded him when Stannis commanded him to remain at Castle Black. Like any boy his age, his head was full of dreams of glory; no doubt he had been picturing the prowess he would display at Deepwood Motte. Other boys his age had gone south, to serve as squires to the king\u2019s knights and ride into battle at their side. Devan\u2019s exclusion must have seemed a rebuke, a punishment for some failure on his part, or perhaps for some failure of his father.\nIn truth, he was here because Melisandre had asked for him. The four eldest sons of Davos Seaworth had perished in the battle on the Blackwater, when the king\u2019s fleet had been consumed by green fire. Devan was the fifthborn and safer here with her than at the king\u2019s side. Lord Davos would not thank her for it, no more than the boy himself, but it seemed to her that Seaworth had suffered enough grief. Misguided as he was, his loyalty to Stannis could not be doubted. She had seen that in her flames.\nDevan was quick and smart and able too, which was more than could be said about most of her attendants. Stannis had left a dozen of his men behind to serve her when he marched south, but most of them were useless. His Grace had need of every sword, so all he could spare were greybeards and cripples. One man had been blinded by a blow to his head in the battle by the Wall, another lamed when his falling horse crushed his legs. Her serjeant had lost an arm to a giant\u2019s club. Three of her guard were geldings that Stannis had castrated for raping wildling women. She had two drunkards and a craven too. The last should have been hanged, as the king himself admitted, but he came from a noble family, and his father and brothers had been stalwart from the first.\nHaving guards about her would no doubt help keep the black brothers properly respectful, the red priestess knew, but none of the men that Stannis had given her were like to be much help should she find herself in peril. It made no matter. Melisandre of Asshai did not fear for herself. R\u2019hllor would protect her.\nShe took another sip of water, laid her cup aside, blinked and stretched and rose from her chair, her muscles sore and stiff. After gazing into the flames so long, it took her a few moments to adjust to the dimness. Her eyes were dry and tired, but if she rubbed them, it would only make them worse.\nHer fire had burned low, she saw. \u201cDevan, more wood. What hour is it?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost dawn, my lady.\u201d\nDawn. Another day is given us, R\u2019hllor be praised. The terrors of the night recede. Melisandre had spent the night in her chair by the fire, as she often did. With Stannis gone, her bed saw little use. She had no time for sleep, with the weight of the world upon her shoulders. And she feared to dream. Sleep is a little death, dreams the whisperings of the Other, who would drag us all into his eternal night. She would sooner sit bathed in the ruddy glow of her red lord\u2019s blessed flames, her cheeks flushed by the wash of heat as if by a lover\u2019s kisses. Some nights she drowsed, but never for more than an hour. One day, Melisandre prayed, she would not sleep at all. One day she would be free of dreams. Melony, she thought. Lot Seven.\nDevan fed fresh logs to the fire until the flames leapt up again, fierce and furious, driving the shadows back into the corners of the room, devouring all her unwanted dreams. The dark recedes again\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for a little while. But beyond the Wall, the enemy grows stronger, and should he win the dawn will never come again. She wondered if it had been his face that she had seen, staring out at her from the flames. No. Surely not. His visage would be more frightening than that, cold and black and too terrible for any man to gaze upon and live. The wooden man she had glimpsed, though, and the boy with the wolf\u2019s face\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they were his servants, surely\u00a0\u2026\u00a0his champions, as Stannis was hers.\nMelisandre went to her window, pushed open the shutters. Outside the east had just begun to lighten, and the stars of morning still hung in a pitch-black sky. Castle Black was already beginning to stir as men in black cloaks made their way across the yard to break their fast with bowls of porridge before they relieved their brothers atop the Wall. A few snowflakes drifted by the open window, floating on the wind.\n\u201cDoes my lady wish to break her fast?\u201d asked Devan.\nFood. Yes, I should eat. Some days she forgot. R\u2019hllor provided her with all the nourishment her body needed, but that was something best concealed from mortal men.\nIt was Jon Snow she needed, not fried bread and bacon, but it was no use sending Devan to the lord commander. He would not come to her summons. Snow still chose to dwell behind the armory, in a pair of modest rooms previously occupied by the Watch\u2019s late blacksmith. Perhaps he did not think himself worthy of the King\u2019s Tower, or perhaps he did not care. That was his mistake, the false humility of youth that is itself a sort of pride. It was never wise for a ruler to eschew the trappings of power, for power itself flows in no small measure from such trappings.\nThe boy was not entirely naive, however. He knew better than to come to Melisandre\u2019s chambers like a supplicant, insisting she come to him instead should she have need of words with him. And oft as not, when she did come, he would keep her waiting or refuse to see her. That much, at least, was shrewd.\n\u201cI will have nettle tea, a boiled egg, and bread with butter. Fresh bread, if you please, not fried. You may find the wildling as well. Tell him that I must speak with him.\u201d\n\u201cRattleshirt, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cAnd quickly.\u201d\nWhile the boy was gone, Melisandre washed herself and changed her robes. Her sleeves were full of hidden pockets, and she checked them carefully as she did every morning to make certain all her powders were in place. Powders to turn fire green or blue or silver, powders to make a flame roar and hiss and leap up higher than a man is tall, powders to make smoke. A smoke for truth, a smoke for lust, a smoke for fear, and the thick black smoke that could kill a man outright. The red priestess armed herself with a pinch of each of them.\nThe carved chest that she had brought across the narrow sea was more than three-quarters empty now. And while Melisandre had the knowledge to make more powders, she lacked many rare ingredients. My spells should suffice. She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before. Such shadows as I bring forth here will be terrible, and no creature of the dark will stand before them. With such sorceries at her command, she should soon have no more need of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers.\nShe shut the chest, turned the lock, and hid the key inside her skirts in another secret pocket. Then came a rapping at her door. Her one-armed serjeant, from the tremulous sound of his knock. \u201cLady Melisandre, the Lord o\u2019 Bones is come.\u201d\n\u201cSend him in.\u201d Melisandre settled herself back into the chair beside the hearth.\nThe wildling wore a sleeveless jerkin of boiled leather dotted with bronze studs beneath a worn cloak mottled in shades of green and brown. No bones. He was cloaked in shadows too, in wisps of ragged grey mist, half-seen, sliding across his face and form with every step he took. Ugly things. As ugly as his bones. A widow\u2019s peak, close-set dark eyes, pinched cheeks, a mustache wriggling like a worm above a mouthful of broken brown teeth.\nMelisandre felt the warmth in the hollow of her throat as her ruby stirred at the closeness of its slave. \u201cYou have put aside your suit of bones,\u201d she observed.\n\u201cThe clacking was like to drive me mad.\u201d\n\u201cThe bones protect you,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThe black brothers do not love you. Devan tells me that only yesterday you had words with some of them over supper.\u201d\n\u201cA few. I was eating bean-and-bacon soup whilst Bowen Marsh was going on about the high ground. The Old Pomegranate thought that I was spying on him and announced that he would not suffer murderers listening to their councils. I told him that if that was true, maybe they shouldn\u2019t have them by the fire. Bowen turned red and made some choking sounds, but that was as far as it went.\u201d The wildling sat on the edge of the window, slid his dagger from its sheath. \u201cIf some crow wants to slip a knife between my ribs whilst I\u2019m spooning up some supper, he\u2019s welcome to try. Hobb\u2019s gruel would taste better with a drop of blood to spice it.\u201d\nMelisandre paid the naked steel no mind. If the wildling had meant her harm, she would have seen it in her flames. Danger to her own person was the first thing she had learned to see, back when she was still half a child, a slave girl bound for life to the great red temple. It was still the first thing she looked for whenever she gazed into a fire. \u201cIt is their eyes that should concern you, not their knives,\u201d she warned him.\n\u201cThe glamor, aye.\u201d In the black iron fetter about his wrist, the ruby seemed to pulse. He tapped it with the edge of his blade. The steel made a faint click against the stone. \u201cI feel it when I sleep. Warm against my skin, even through the iron. Soft as a woman\u2019s kiss. Your kiss. But sometimes in my dreams it starts to burn, and your lips turn into teeth. Every day I think how easy it would be to pry it out, and every day I don\u2019t. Must I wear the bloody bones as well?\u201d\n\u201cThe spell is made of shadow and suggestion. Men see what they expect to see. The bones are part of that.\u201d Was I wrong to spare this one? \u201cIf the glamor fails, they will kill you.\u201d\nThe wildling began to scrape the dirt out from beneath his nails with the point of his dagger. \u201cI\u2019ve sung my songs, fought my battles, drunk summer wine, tasted the Dornishman\u2019s wife. A man should die the way he\u2019s lived. For me that\u2019s steel in hand.\u201d\nDoes he dream of death? Could the enemy have touched him? Death is his domain, the dead his soldiers. \u201cYou shall have work for your steel soon enough. The enemy is moving, the true enemy. And Lord Snow\u2019s rangers will return before the day is done, with their blind and bloody eyes.\u201d\nThe wildling\u2019s own eyes narrowed. Grey eyes, brown eyes; Melisandre could see the color change with each pulse of the ruby. \u201cCutting out the eyes, that\u2019s the Weeper\u2019s work. The best crow\u2019s a blind crow, he likes to say. Sometimes I think he\u2019d like to cut out his own eyes, the way they\u2019re always watering and itching. Snow\u2019s been assuming the free folk would turn to Tormund to lead them, because that\u2019s what he would do. He liked Tormund, and the old fraud liked him too. If it\u2019s the Weeper, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that\u2019s not good. Not for him, and not for us.\u201d\nMelisandre nodded solemnly, as if she had taken his words to heart, but this Weeper did not matter. None of his free folk mattered. They were a lost people, a doomed people, destined to vanish from the earth, as the children of the forest had vanished. Those were not words he would wish to hear, though, and she could not risk losing him, not now. \u201cHow well do you know the north?\u201d\nHe slipped his blade away. \u201cAs well as any raider. Some parts more than others. There\u2019s a lot of north. Why?\u201d\n\u201cThe girl,\u201d she said. \u201cA girl in grey on a dying horse. Jon Snow\u2019s sister.\u201d Who else could it be? She was racing to him for protection, that much Melisandre had seen clearly. \u201cI have seen her in my flames, but only once. We must win the lord commander\u2019s trust, and the only way to do that is to save her.\u201d\n\u201cMe save her, you mean? The Lord o\u2019 Bones?\u201d He laughed. \u201cNo one ever trusted Rattleshirt but fools. Snow\u2019s not that. If his sister needs saving, he\u2019ll send his crows. I would.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not you. He made his vows and means to live by them. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part. But you are not Night\u2019s Watch. You can do what he cannot.\u201d\n\u201cIf your stiff-necked lord commander will allow it. Did your fires show you where to find this girl?\u201d\n\u201cI saw water. Deep and blue and still, with a thin coat of ice just forming on it. It seemed to go on and on forever.\u201d\n\u201cLong Lake. What else did you see around this girl?\u201d\n\u201cHills. Fields. Trees. A deer, once. Stones. She is staying well away from villages. When she can she rides along the bed of little streams, to throw hunters off her trail.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cThat will make it difficult. She was coming north, you said. Was the lake to her east or to her west?\u201d\nMelisandre closed her eyes, remembering. \u201cWest.\u201d\n\u201cShe is not coming up the kingsroad, then. Clever girl. There are fewer watchers on the other side, and more cover. And some hidey-holes I have used myself from time\u2014\u201d He broke off at the sound of a warhorn and rose swiftly to his feet. All over Castle Black, Melisandre knew, the same sudden hush had fallen, and every man and boy turned toward the Wall, listening, waiting. One long blast of the horn meant rangers returning, but two\u00a0\u2026\nThe day has come, the red priestess thought. Lord Snow will have to listen to me now.\nAfter the long mournful cry of the horn had faded away, the silence seemed to stretch out to an hour. The wildling finally broke the spell. \u201cOnly one, then. Rangers.\u201d\n\u201cDead rangers.\u201d Melisandre rose to her feet as well. \u201cGo put on your bones and wait. I will return.\u201d\n\u201cI should go with you.\u201d\n\u201cDo not be foolish. Once they find what they will find, the sight of any wildling will inflame them. Stay here until their blood has time to cool.\u201d\nDevan was coming up the steps of the King\u2019s Tower as Melisandre made her descent, flanked by two of the guards Stannis had left her. The boy was carrying her half-forgotten breakfast on a tray. \u201cI waited for Hobb to pull the fresh loaves from the ovens, my lady. The bread\u2019s still hot.\u201d\n\u201cLeave it in my chambers.\u201d The wildling would eat it, like as not. \u201cLord Snow has need of me, beyond the Wall.\u201d He does not know it yet, but soon\u00a0\u2026\nOutside, a light snow had begun to fall. A crowd of crows had gathered around the gate by the time Melisandre and her escort arrived, but they made way for the red priestess. The lord commander had preceded her through the ice, accompanied by Bowen Marsh and twenty spearmen. Snow had also sent a dozen archers to the top of the Wall, should any foes be hidden in the nearby woods. The guards on the gate were not queen\u2019s men, but they passed her all the same.\nIt was cold and dark beneath the ice, in the narrow tunnel that crooked and slithered through the Wall. Morgan went before her with a torch and Merrel came behind her with an axe. Both men were hopeless drunkards, but they were sober at this hour of the morning. Queen\u2019s men, at least in name, both had a healthy fear of her, and Merrel could be formidable when he was not drunk. She would have no need of them today, but Melisandre made it a point to keep a pair of guards about her everywhere she went. It sent a certain message. The trappings of power.\nBy the time the three of them emerged north of the Wall the snow was falling steadily. A ragged blanket of white covered the torn and tortured earth that stretched from the Wall to the edge of the haunted forest. Jon Snow and his black brothers were gathered around three spears, some twenty yards away.\nThe spears were eight feet long and made of ash. The one on the left had a slight crook, but the other two were smooth and straight. At the top of each was impaled a severed head. Their beards were full of ice, and the falling snow had given them white hoods. Where their eyes had been, only empty sockets remained, black and bloody holes that stared down in silent accusation.\n\u201cWho were they?\u201d Melisandre asked the crows.\n\u201cBlack Jack Bulwer, Hairy Hal, and Garth Greyfeather,\u201d Bowen Marsh said solemnly. \u201cThe ground is half-frozen. It must have taken the wildlings half the night to drive the spears so deep. They could still be close. Watching us.\u201d The Lord Steward squinted at the line of trees.\n\u201cCould be a hundred of them out there,\u201d said the black brother with the dour face. \u201cCould be a thousand.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jon Snow. \u201cThey left their gifts in the black of night, then ran.\u201d His huge white direwolf prowled around the shafts, sniffing, then lifted his leg and pissed on the spear that held the head of Black Jack Bulwer. \u201cGhost would have their scent if they were still out there.\u201d\n\u201cI hope the Weeper burned the bodies,\u201d said the dour man, the one called Dolorous Edd. \u201cElsewise they might come looking for their heads.\u201d\nJon Snow grasped the spear that bore Garth Greyfeather\u2019s head and wrenched it violently from the ground. \u201cPull down the other two,\u201d he commanded, and four of the crows hurried to obey.\nBowen Marsh\u2019s cheeks were red with cold. \u201cWe should never have sent out rangers.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the time and place to pick at that wound. Not here, my lord. Not now.\u201d To the men struggling with the spears Snow said, \u201cTake the heads and burn them. Leave nothing but bare bone.\u201d Only then did he seem to notice Melisandre. \u201cMy lady. Walk with me, if you would.\u201d\nAt last. \u201cIf it please the lord commander.\u201d\nAs they walked beneath the Wall, she slipped her arm through his. Morgan and Merrel went before them, Ghost came prowling at their heels. The priestess did not speak, but she slowed her pace deliberately, and where she walked the ice began to drip. He will not fail to notice that.\nBeneath the iron grating of a murder hole Snow broke the silence, as she had known he would. \u201cWhat of the other six?\u201d\n\u201cI have not seen them,\u201d Melisandre said.\n\u201cWill you look?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a raven from Ser Denys Mallister at the Shadow Tower,\u201d Jon Snow told her. \u201cHis men have seen fires in the mountains on the far side of the Gorge. Wildlings massing, Ser Denys believes. He thinks they are going to try to force the Bridge of Skulls again.\u201d\n\u201cSome may.\u201d Could the skulls in her vision have signified this bridge? Somehow Melisandre did not think so. \u201cIf it comes, that attack will be no more than a diversion. I saw towers by the sea, submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. That is where the heaviest blow will fall.\u201d\n\u201cEastwatch?\u201d\nWas it? Melisandre had seen Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with King Stannis. That was where His Grace left Queen Selyse and their daughter Shireen when he assembled his knights for the march to Castle Black. The towers in her fire had been different, but that was oft the way with visions. \u201cYes. Eastwatch, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\nShe spread her hands. \u201cOn the morrow. In a moon\u2019s turn. In a year. And it may be that if you act, you may avert what I have seen entirely.\u201d Else what would be the point of visions?\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Snow.\nThe crowd of crows beyond the gate had swollen to two score by the time they emerged from beneath the Wall. The men pressed close about them. Melisandre knew a few by name: the cook Three-Finger Hobb, Mully with his greasy orange hair, the dim-witted boy called Owen the Oaf, the drunkard Septon Celladar.\n\u201cIs it true, m\u2019lord?\u201d said Three-Finger Hobb.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Owen the Oaf. \u201cNot Dywen, is it?\u201d\n\u201cNor Garth,\u201d said the queen\u2019s man she knew as Alf of Runnymudd, one of the first to exchange his seven false gods for the truth of R\u2019hllor. \u201cGarth\u2019s too clever for them wildlings.\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d Mully asked.\n\u201cThree,\u201d Jon told them. \u201cBlack Jack, Hairy Hal, and Garth.\u201d\nAlf of Runnymudd let out a howl loud enough to wake sleepers in the Shadow Tower. \u201cPut him to bed and get some mulled wine into him,\u201d Jon told Three-Finger Hobb.\n\u201cLord Snow,\u201d Melisandre said quietly. \u201cWill you come with me to the King\u2019s Tower? I have more to share with you.\u201d\nHe looked at her face for a long moment with those cold grey eyes of his. His right hand closed, opened, closed again. \u201cAs you wish. Edd, take Ghost back to my chambers.\u201d\nMelisandre took that as a sign and dismissed her own guard as well. They crossed the yard together, just the two of them. The snow fell all around them. She walked as close to Jon Snow as she dared, close enough to feel the mistrust pouring off him like a black fog. He does not love me, will never love me, but he will make use of me. Well and good. Melisandre had danced the same dance with Stannis Baratheon, back in the beginning. In truth, the young lord commander and her king had more in common than either one would ever be willing to admit. Stannis had been a younger son living in the shadow of his elder brother, just as Jon Snow, bastard-born, had always been eclipsed by his trueborn sibling, the fallen hero men had called the Young Wolf. Both men were unbelievers by nature, mistrustful, suspicious. The only gods they truly worshiped were honor and duty.\n\u201cYou have not asked about your sister,\u201d Melisandre said, as they climbed the spiral steps of the King\u2019s Tower.\n\u201cI told you. I have no sister. We put aside our kin when we say our words. I cannot help Arya, much as I\u2014\u201d\nHe broke off as they stepped inside her chambers. The wildling was within, seated at her board, spreading butter on a ragged chunk of warm brown bread with his dagger. He had donned the bone armor, she was pleased to see. The broken giant\u2019s skull that was his helm rested on the window seat behind him.\nJon Snow tensed. \u201cYou.\u201d\n\u201cLord Snow.\u201d The wildling grinned at them through a mouth of brown and broken teeth. The ruby on his wrist glimmered in the morning light like a dim red star.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cBreaking my fast. You\u2019re welcome to share.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll not break bread with you.\u201d\n\u201cYour loss. The loaf\u2019s still warm. Hobb can do that much, at least.\u201d The wildling ripped off a bite. \u201cI could visit you as easily, my lord. Those guards at your door are a bad jape. A man who has climbed the Wall half a hundred times can climb in a window easy enough. But what good would come of killing you? The crows would only choose someone worse.\u201d He chewed, swallowed. \u201cI heard about your rangers. You should have sent me with them.\u201d\n\u201cSo you could betray them to the Weeper?\u201d\n\u201cAre we talking about betrayals? What was the name of that wildling wife of yours, Snow? Ygritte, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d The wildling turned to Melisandre. \u201cI will need horses. Half a dozen good ones. And this is nothing I can do alone. Some of the spearwives penned up at Mole\u2019s Town should serve. Women would be best for this. The girl\u2019s more like to trust them, and they will help me carry off a certain ploy I have in mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d Lord Snow asked her.\n\u201cYour sister.\u201d Melisandre put her hand on his arm. \u201cYou cannot help her, but he can.\u201d\nSnow wrenched his arm away. \u201cI think not. You do not know this creature. Rattleshirt could wash his hands a hundred times a day and he\u2019d still have blood beneath his nails. He\u2019d be more like to rape and murder Arya than to save her. No. If this was what you have seen in your fires, my lady, you must have ashes in your eyes. If he tries to leave Castle Black without my leave, I\u2019ll take his head off myself.\u201d\nHe leaves me no choice. So be it. \u201cDevan, leave us,\u201d she said, and the squire slipped away and closed the door behind him.\nMelisandre touched the ruby at her neck and spoke a word.\nThe sound echoed queerly from the corners of the room and twisted like a worm inside their ears. The wildling heard one word, the crow another. Neither was the word that left her lips. The ruby on the wildling\u2019s wrist darkened, and the wisps of light and shadow around him writhed and faded.\nThe bones remained\u2014the rattling ribs, the claws and teeth along his arms and shoulders, the great yellowed collarbone across his shoulders. The broken giant\u2019s skull remained a broken giant\u2019s skull, yellowed and cracked, grinning its stained and savage grin.\nBut the widow\u2019s peak dissolved. The brown mustache, the knobby chin, the sallow yellowed flesh and small dark eyes, all melted. Grey fingers crept through long brown hair. Laugh lines appeared at the corners of his mouth. All at once he was bigger than before, broader in the chest and shoulders, long-legged and lean, his face clean-shaved and windburnt.\nJon Snow\u2019s grey eyes grew wider. \u201cMance?\u201d\n\u201cLord Snow.\u201d Mance Rayder did not smile.\n\u201cShe burned you.\u201d\n\u201cShe burned the Lord of Bones.\u201d\nJon Snow turned to Melisandre. \u201cWhat sorcery is this?\u201d\n\u201cCall it what you will. Glamor, seeming, illusion. R\u2019hllor is Lord of Light, Jon Snow, and it is given to his servants to weave with it, as others weave with thread.\u201d\nMance Rayder chuckled. \u201cI had my doubts as well, Snow, but why not let her try? It was that, or let Stannis roast me.\u201d\n\u201cThe bones help,\u201d said Melisandre. \u201cThe bones remember. The strongest glamors are built of such things. A dead man\u2019s boots, a hank of hair, a bag of fingerbones. With whispered words and prayer, a man\u2019s shadow can be drawn forth from such and draped about another like a cloak. The wearer\u2019s essence does not change, only his seeming.\u201d\nShe made it sound a simple thing, and easy. They need never know how difficult it had been, or how much it had cost her. That was a lesson Melisandre had learned long before Asshai; the more effortless the sorcery appears, the more men fear the sorcerer. When the flames had licked at Rattleshirt, the ruby at her throat had grown so hot that she had feared her own flesh might start to smoke and blacken. Thankfully Lord Snow had delivered her from that agony with his arrows. Whilst Stannis had seethed at the defiance, she had shuddered with relief.\n\u201cOur false king has a prickly manner,\u201d Melisandre told Jon Snow, \u201cbut he will not betray you. We hold his son, remember. And he owes you his very life.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Snow sounded startled.\n\u201cWho else, my lord? Only his life\u2019s blood could pay for his crimes, your laws said, and Stannis Baratheon is not a man to go against the law\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but as you said so sagely, the laws of men end at the Wall. I told you that the Lord of Light would hear your prayers. You wanted a way to save your little sister and still hold fast to the honor that means so much to you, to the vows you swore before your wooden god.\u201d She pointed with a pale finger. \u201cThere he stands, Lord Snow. Arya\u2019s deliverance. A gift from the Lord of Light\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and me.\u201d",

      "content": "REEK\nHe heard the girls first, barking as they raced for home. The drum of hoofbeats echoing off flagstone jerked him to his feet, chains rattling. The one between his ankles was no more than a foot long, shortening his stride to a shuffle. It was hard to move quickly that way, but he tried as best he could, hopping and clanking from his pallet. Ramsay Bolton had returned and would want his Reek on hand to serve him.\nOutside, beneath a cold autumnal sky, the hunters were pouring through the gates. Ben Bones led the way, with the girls baying and barking all around him. Behind came Skinner, Sour Alyn, and Damon Dance-for-Me with his long greased whip, then the Walders riding the grey colts Lady Dustin had given them. His lordship himself rode Blood, a red stallion with a temper to match his own. He was laughing. That could be very good or very bad, Reek knew.\nThe dogs were on him before he could puzzle out which, drawn to his scent. The dogs were fond of Reek; he slept with them oft as not, and sometimes Ben Bones let him share their supper. The pack raced across the flagstones barking, circling him, jumping up to lick his filthy face, nipping at his legs. Helicent caught his left hand between her teeth and worried it so fiercely Reek feared he might lose two more fingers. Red Jeyne slammed into his chest and knocked him off his feet. She was lean, hard muscle, where Reek was loose, grey skin and brittle bones, a white-haired starveling.\nThe riders were dismounting by the time he pushed Red Jeyne off and struggled to his knees. Two dozen horsemen had gone out and two dozen had returned, which meant the search had been a failure. That was bad. Ramsay did not like the taste of failure. He will want to hurt someone.\nOf late, his lord had been forced to restrain himself, for Barrowton was full of men House Bolton needed, and Ramsay knew to be careful around the Dustins and Ryswells and his fellow lordlings. With them he was always courteous and smiling. What he was behind closed doors was something else.\nRamsay Bolton was attired as befit the lord of the Hornwood and heir to the Dreadfort. His mantle was stitched together from wolfskins and clasped against the autumn chill by the yellowed teeth of the wolf\u2019s head on his right shoulder. On one hip he wore a falchion, its blade as thick and heavy as a cleaver; on the other a long dagger and a small curved flaying knife with a hooked point and a razor-sharp edge. All three blades had matched hilts of yellow bone. \u201cReek,\u201d his lordship called down from Blood\u2019s high saddle, \u201cyou stink. I can smell you clear across the yard.\u201d\n\u201cI know, my lord,\u201d Reek had to say. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\n\u201cI brought you a gift.\u201d Ramsay twisted, reached behind him, pulled something from his saddle, and flung it. \u201cCatch!\u201d\nBetween the chain, the fetters, and his missing fingers, Reek was clumsier than he had been before he learned his name. The head struck his maimed hands, bounced away from the stumps of his fingers, and landed at his feet, raining maggots. It was so crusted with dried blood as to be unrecognizable.\n\u201cI told you to catch it,\u201d said Ramsay. \u201cPick it up.\u201d\nReek tried to lift the head up by the ear. It was no good. The flesh was green and rotting, and the ear tore off between his fingers. Little Walder laughed, and a moment later all the other men were laughing too. \u201cOh, leave him be,\u201d said Ramsay. \u201cJust see to Blood. I rode the bastard hard.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord. I will.\u201d Reek hurried to the horse, leaving the severed head for the dogs.\n\u201cYou smell like pigshit today, Reek,\u201d said Ramsay.\n\u201cOn him, that\u2019s an improvement,\u201d said Damon Dance-for-Me, smiling as he coiled his whip.\nLittle Walder swung down from the saddle. \u201cYou can see to my horse too, Reek. And to my little cousin\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI can see to my own horse,\u201d said Big Walder. Little Walder had become Lord Ramsay\u2019s best boy and grew more like him every day, but the smaller Frey was made of different stuff and seldom took part in his cousin\u2019s games and cruelties.\nReek paid the squires no mind. He led Blood off toward the stables, hopping aside when the stallion tried to kick him. The hunters strode into the hall, all but Ben Bones, who was cursing at the dogs to stop them fighting over the severed head.\nBig Walder followed him into the stables, leading his own mount. Reek stole a look at him as he removed Blood\u2019s bit. \u201cWho was he?\u201d he said softly, so the other stablehands would not hear.\n\u201cNo one.\u201d Big Walder pulled the saddle off his grey. \u201cAn old man we met on the road, is all. He was driving an old nanny goat and four kids.\u201d\n\u201cHis lordship slew him for his goats?\u201d\n\u201cHis lordship slew him for calling him Lord Snow. The goats were good, though. We milked the mother and roasted up the kids.\u201d\nLord Snow. Reek nodded, his chains clinking as he wrestled with Blood\u2019s saddle straps. By any name, Ramsay\u2019s no man to be around when he is in a rage. Or when he\u2019s not. \u201cDid you find your cousins, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I never thought we would. They\u2019re dead. Lord Wyman had them killed. That\u2019s what I would have done if I was him.\u201d\nReek said nothing. Some things were not safe to say, not even in the stables with his lordship in the hall. One wrong word could cost him another toe, even a finger. Not my tongue, though. He will never take my tongue. He likes to hear me plead with him to spare me from the pain. He likes to make me say it.\nThe riders had been sixteen days on the hunt, with only hard bread and salt beef to eat, aside from the occasional stolen kid, so that night Lord Ramsay commanded that a feast be laid to celebrate his return to Barrowton. Their host, a grizzled one-armed petty lord by the name of Harwood Stout, knew better than to refuse him, though by now his larders must be well nigh exhausted. Reek had heard Stout\u2019s servants muttering at how the Bastard and his men were eating through the winter stores. \u201cHe\u2019ll bed Lord Eddard\u2019s little girl, they say,\u201d Stout\u2019s cook complained when she did not know that Reek was listening, \u201cbut we\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll be fucked when the snows come, you mark my words.\u201d\nYet Lord Ramsay had decreed a feast, so feast they must. Trestle tables were set up in Stout\u2019s hall, an ox was slaughtered, and that night as the sun went down the empty-handed hunters ate roasts and ribs, barley bread, a mash of carrots and pease, washing it all down with prodigious quantities of ale.\nIt fell to Little Walder to keep Lord Ramsay\u2019s cup filled, whilst Big Walder poured for the others at the high table. Reek was chained up beside the doors lest his odor put the feasters off their appetites. He would eat later, off whatever scraps Lord Ramsay thought to send him. The dogs enjoyed the run of the hall, however, and provided the night\u2019s best entertainment, when Maude and Grey Jeyne tore into one of Lord Stout\u2019s hounds over an especially meaty bone that Will Short had tossed them. Reek was the only man in the hall who did not watch the three dogs fight. He kept his eyes on Ramsay Bolton.\nThe fight did not end until their host\u2019s dog was dead. Stout\u2019s old hound never stood a mummer\u2019s chance. He had been one against two, and Ramsay\u2019s bitches were young, strong, and savage. Ben Bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told Reek they were all named after peasant girls Ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he\u2019d still been a bastard, running with the first Reek. \u201cThe ones who give him good sport, anywise. The ones who weep and beg and won\u2019t run don\u2019t get to come back as bitches.\u201d The next litter to come out of the Dreadfort\u2019s kennels would include a Kyra, Reek did not doubt. \u201cHe\u2019s trained \u2019em to kill wolves as well,\u201d Ben Bones had confided. Reek said nothing. He knew which wolves the girls were meant to kill, but he had no wish to watch the girls fighting over his severed toe.\nTwo serving men were carrying off the dead dog\u2019s carcass and an old woman had fetched out a mop and rake and bucket to deal with the blood-soaked rushes when the doors to the hall flew open in a wash of wind, and a dozen men in grey mail and iron halfhelms stalked through, shouldering past Stout\u2019s pasty-faced young guards in their leather brigandines and cloaks of gold and russet. A sudden silence seized the feasters\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all but Lord Ramsay, who tossed aside the bone he had been gnawing, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, smiled a greasy, wet-lipped smile, and said, \u201cFather.\u201d\nThe Lord of the Dreadfort glanced idly at the remnants of the feast, at the dead dog, at the hangings on the walls, at Reek in his chains and fetters. \u201cOut,\u201d he told the feasters, in a voice as soft as a murmur. \u201cNow. The lot of you.\u201d\nLord Ramsay\u2019s men pushed back from the tables, abandoning cups and trenchers. Ben Bones shouted at the girls, and they trotted after him, some with bones still in their jaws. Harwood Stout bowed stiffly and relinquished his hall without a word. \u201cUnchain Reek and take him with you,\u201d Ramsay growled at Sour Alyn, but his father waved a pale hand and said, \u201cNo, leave him.\u201d\nEven Lord Roose\u2019s own guards retreated, pulling the doors shut behind them. When the echo died away, Reek found himself alone in the hall with the two Boltons, father and son.\n\u201cYou did not find our missing Freys.\u201d The way Roose Bolton said it, it was more a statement than a question.\n\u201cWe rode back to where Lord Lamprey claims they parted ways, but the girls could not find a trail.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked after them in villages and holdfasts.\u201d\n\u201cA waste of words. The peasants might as well be blind for all they ever see.\u201d Ramsay shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter? The world won\u2019t miss a few Freys. There\u2019s plenty more down at the Twins should we ever have need of one.\u201d\nLord Roose tore a small piece off a heel of bread and ate it. \u201cHosteen and Aenys are distressed.\u201d\n\u201cLet them go looking, if they like.\u201d\n\u201cLord Wyman blames himself. To hear him tell it, he had become especially fond of Rhaegar.\u201d\nLord Ramsay was turning wroth. Reek could see it in his mouth, the curl of those thick lips, the way the cords stood up in his neck. \u201cThe fools should have stayed with Manderly.\u201d\nRoose Bolton shrugged. \u201cLord Wyman\u2019s litter moves at a snail\u2019s pace\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and of course his lordship\u2019s health and girth do not permit him to travel more than a few hours a day, with frequent stops for meals. The Freys were anxious to reach Barrowton and be reunited with their kin. Can you blame them for riding on ahead?\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what they did. Do you believe Manderly?\u201d\nHis father\u2019s pale eyes glittered. \u201cDid I give you that impression? Still. His lordship is most distraught.\u201d\n\u201cNot so distraught that he can\u2019t eat. Lord Pig must have brought half the food in White Harbor with him.\u201d\n\u201cForty wayns full of foodstuffs. Casks of wine and hippocras, barrels of fresh-caught lampreys, a herd of goats, a hundred pigs, crates of crabs and oysters, a monstrous codfish\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Lord Wyman likes to eat. You may have noticed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I noticed was that he brought no hostages.\u201d\n\u201cI noticed that as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean to do about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a quandary.\u201d Lord Roose found an empty cup, wiped it out on the tablecloth, and filled it from a flagon. \u201cManderly is not alone in throwing feasts, it would seem.\u201d\n\u201cIt should have been you who threw the feast, to welcome me back,\u201d Ramsay complained, \u201cand it should have been in Barrow Hall, not this pisspot of a castle.\u201d\n\u201cBarrow Hall and its kitchens are not mine to dispose of,\u201d his father said mildly. \u201cI am only a guest there. The castle and the town belong to Lady Dustin, and she cannot abide you.\u201d\nRamsay\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIf I cut off her teats and feed them to my girls, will she abide me then? Will she abide me if I strip off her skin to make myself a pair of boots?\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely. And those boots would come dear. They would cost us Barrowton, House Dustin, and the Ryswells.\u201d Roose Bolton seated himself across the table from his son. \u201cBarbrey Dustin is my second wife\u2019s younger sister, Rodrik Ryswell\u2019s daughter, sister to Roger, Rickard, and mine own namesake, Roose, cousin to the other Ryswells. She was fond of my late son and suspects you of having some part in his demise. Lady Barbrey is a woman who knows how to nurse a grievance. Be grateful for that. Barrowton is staunch for Bolton largely because she still holds Ned Stark to blame for her husband\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cStaunch?\u201d Ramsay seethed. \u201cAll she does is spit on me. The day will come when I\u2019ll set her precious wooden town afire. Let her spit on that, see if it puts out the flames.\u201d\nRoose made a face, as if the ale he was sipping had suddenly gone sour. \u201cThere are times you make me wonder if you truly are my seed. My forebears were many things, but never fools. No, be quiet now, I have heard enough. We appear strong for the moment, yes. We have powerful friends in the Lannisters and Freys, and the grudging support of much of the north\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but what do you imagine is going to happen when one of Ned Stark\u2019s sons turns up?\u201d\nNed Stark\u2019s sons are all dead, Reek thought. Robb was murdered at the Twins, and Bran and Rickon\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we dipped the heads in tar\u00a0\u2026 His own head was pounding. He did not want to think about anything that had happened before he knew his name. There were things too hurtful to remember, thoughts almost as painful as Ramsay\u2019s flaying knife\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cStark\u2019s little wolflings are dead,\u201d said Ramsay, sloshing some more ale into his cup, \u201cand they\u2019ll stay dead. Let them show their ugly faces, and my girls will rip those wolves of theirs to pieces. The sooner they turn up, the sooner I kill them again.\u201d\nThe elder Bolton sighed. \u201cAgain? Surely you misspeak. You never slew Lord Eddard\u2019s sons, those two sweet boys we loved so well. That was Theon Turncloak\u2019s work, remember? How many of our grudging friends do you imagine we\u2019d retain if the truth were known? Only Lady Barbrey, whom you would turn into a pair of boots\u00a0\u2026\u00a0inferior boots. Human skin is not as tough as cowhide and will not wear as well. By the king\u2019s decree you are now a Bolton. Try and act like one. Tales are told of you, Ramsay. I hear them everywhere. People fear you.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cYou are mistaken. It is not good. No tales were ever told of me. Do you think I would be sitting here if it were otherwise? Your amusements are your own, I will not chide you on that count, but you must be more discreet. A peaceful land, a quiet people. That has always been my rule. Make it yours.\u201d\n\u201cIs this why you left Lady Dustin and your fat pig wife? So you could come down here and tell me to be quiet?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. There are tidings that you need to hear. Lord Stannis has finally left the Wall.\u201d\nThat got Ramsay halfway to his feet, a smile glistening on his wide, wet lips. \u201cIs he marching on the Dreadfort?\u201d\n\u201cHe is not, alas. Arnolf does not understand it. He swears that he did all he could to bait the trap.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder. Scratch a Karstark and you\u2019ll find a Stark.\u201d\n\u201cAfter the scratch the Young Wolf gave Lord Rickard, that may be somewhat less true than formerly. Be that as it may. Lord Stannis has taken Deepwood Motte from the ironmen and restored it to House Glover. Worse, the mountain clans have joined him, Wull and Norrey and Liddle and the rest. His strength is growing.\u201d\n\u201cOurs is greater.\u201d\n\u201cNow it is.\u201d\n\u201cNow is the time to smash him. Let me march on Deepwood.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you are wed.\u201d\nRamsay slammed down his cup, and the dregs of his ale erupted across the tablecloth. \u201cI\u2019m sick of waiting. We have a girl, we have a tree, and we have lords enough to witness. I\u2019ll wed her on the morrow, plant a son between her legs, and march before her maiden\u2019s blood has dried.\u201d\nShe\u2019ll pray for you to march, Reek thought, and she\u2019ll pray that you never come back to her bed.\n\u201cYou will plant a son in her,\u201d Roose Bolton said, \u201cbut not here. I\u2019ve decided you shall wed the girl at Winterfell.\u201d\nThat prospect did not appear to please Lord Ramsay. \u201cI laid waste to Winterfell, or had you forgotten?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but it appears you have\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the ironmen laid waste to Winterfell, and butchered all its people. Theon Turncloak.\u201d\nRamsay gave Reek a suspicious glance. \u201cAye, so he did, but still\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a wedding in that ruin?\u201d\n\u201cEven ruined and broken, Winterfell remains Lady Arya\u2019s home. What better place to wed her, bed her, and stake your claim? That is only half of it, however. We would be fools to march on Stannis. Let Stannis march on us. He is too cautious to come to Barrowton\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he must come to Winterfell. His clansmen will not abandon the daughter of their precious Ned to such as you. Stannis must march or lose them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and being the careful commander that he is, he will summon all his friends and allies when he marches. He will summon Arnolf Karstark.\u201d\nRamsay licked his chapped lips. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have him.\u201d\n\u201cIf the gods will it.\u201d Roose rose to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll wed at Winterfell. I shall inform the lords that we march in three days and invite them to accompany us.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the Warden of the North. Command them.\u201d\n\u201cAn invitation will accomplish the same thing. Power tastes best when sweetened by courtesy. You had best learn that if you ever hope to rule.\u201d The Lord of the Dreadfort glanced at Reek. \u201cOh, and unchain your pet. I am taking him.\u201d\n\u201cTaking him? Where? He\u2019s mine. You cannot have him.\u201d\nRoose seemed amused by that. \u201cAll you have I gave you. You would do well to remember that, bastard. As for this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Reek\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if you have not ruined him beyond redemption, he may yet be of some use to us. Get the keys and remove those chains from him, before you make me rue the day I raped your mother.\u201d\nReek saw the way Ramsay\u2019s mouth twisted, the spittle glistening between his lips. He feared he might leap the table with his dagger in his hand. Instead he flushed red, turned his pale eyes from his father\u2019s paler ones, and went to find the keys. But as he knelt to unlock the fetters around Reek\u2019s wrists and ankles, he leaned close and whispered, \u201cTell him nothing and remember every word he says. I\u2019ll have you back, no matter what that Dustin bitch may tell you. Who are you?\u201d\n\u201cReek, my lord. Your man. I\u2019m Reek, it rhymes with sneak.\u201d\n\u201cIt does. When my father brings you back, I\u2019m going to take another finger. I\u2019ll let you choose which one.\u201d\nUnbidden, tears began to trickle down his cheeks. \u201cWhy?\u201d he cried, his voice breaking. \u201cI never asked for him to take me from you. I\u2019ll do whatever you want, serve, obey, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please, no\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nRamsay slapped his face. \u201cTake him,\u201d he told his father. \u201cHe\u2019s not even a man. The way he smells disgusts me.\u201d\nThe moon was rising over the wooden walls of Barrowton when they stepped outside. Reek could hear the wind sweeping across the rolling plains beyond the town. It was less than a mile from Barrow Hall to Harwood Stout\u2019s modest keep beside the eastern gates. Lord Bolton offered him a horse. \u201cCan you ride?\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my lord, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I think so.\u201d\n\u201cWalton, help him mount.\u201d\nEven with the fetters gone, Reek moved like an old man. His flesh hung loosely on his bones, and Sour Alyn and Ben Bones said he twitched. And his smell\u00a0\u2026\u00a0even the mare they\u2019d brought for him shied away when he tried to mount.\nShe was a gentle horse, though, and she knew the way to Barrow Hall. Lord Bolton fell in beside him as they rode out the gate. The guards fell back to a discreet distance. \u201cWhat would you have me call you?\u201d the lord asked, as they trotted down the broad straight streets of Barrowton.\nReek, I\u2019m Reek, it rhymes with wreak. \u201cReek,\u201d he said, \u201cif it please my lord.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord.\u201d Bolton\u2019s lips parted just enough to show a quarter inch of teeth. It might have been a smile.\nHe did not understand. \u201cMy lord? I said\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014my lord, when you should have said m\u2019lord. Your tongue betrays your birth with every word you say. If you want to sound a proper peasant, say it as if you had mud in your mouth, or were too stupid to realize it was two words, not just one.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please my\u2014m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cBetter. Your stench is quite appalling.\u201d\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord. I beg your pardon, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? The way you smell is my son\u2019s doing, not your own. I am well aware of that.\u201d They rode past a stable and a shuttered inn with a wheat sheaf painted on its sign. Reek heard music coming through its windows. \u201cI knew the first Reek. He stank, though not for want of washing. I have never known a cleaner creature, truth be told. He bathed thrice a day and wore flowers in his hair as if he were a maiden. Once, when my second wife was still alive, he was caught stealing scent from her bedchamber. I had him whipped for that, a dozen lashes. Even his blood smelled wrong. The next year he tried it again. This time he drank the perfume and almost died of it. It made no matter. The smell was something he was born with. A curse, the smallfolk said. The gods had made him stink so that men would know his soul was rotting. My old maester insisted it was a sign of sickness, yet the boy was otherwise as strong as a young bull. No one could stand to be near him, so he slept with the pigs\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until the day that Ramsay\u2019s mother appeared at my gates to demand that I provide a servant for my bastard, who was growing up wild and unruly. I gave her Reek. It was meant to be amusing, but he and Ramsay became inseparable. I do wonder, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0was it Ramsay who corrupted Reek, or Reek Ramsay?\u201d His lordship glanced at the new Reek with eyes as pale and strange as two white moons. \u201cWhat was he whispering whilst he unchained you?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he said\u00a0\u2026\u201d He said to tell you nothing. The words caught in his throat, and he began to cough and choke.\n\u201cBreathe deep. I know what he said. You\u2019re to spy on me and keep his secrets.\u201d Bolton chuckled. \u201cAs if he had secrets. Sour Alyn, Luton, Skinner, and the rest, where does he think they came from? Can he truly believe they are his men?\u201d\n\u201cHis men,\u201d Reek echoed. Some comment seemed to be expected of him, but he did not know what to say.\n\u201cHas my bastard ever told you how I got him?\u201d\nThat he did know, to his relief. \u201cYes, my\u00a0\u2026\u00a0m\u2019lord. You met his mother whilst out riding and were smitten by her beauty.\u201d\n\u201cSmitten?\u201d Bolton laughed. \u201cDid he use that word? Why, the boy has a singer\u2019s soul\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though if you believe that song, you may well be dimmer than the first Reek. Even the riding part is wrong. I was hunting a fox along the Weeping Water when I chanced upon a mill and saw a young woman washing clothes in the stream. The old miller had gotten himself a new young wife, a girl not half his age. She was a tall, willowy creature, very healthy-looking. Long legs and small firm breasts, like two ripe plums. Pretty, in a common sort of way. The moment that I set eyes on her I wanted her. Such was my due. The maesters will tell you that King Jaehaerys abolished the lord\u2019s right to the first night to appease his shrewish queen, but where the old gods rule, old customs linger. The Umbers keep the first night too, deny it as they may. Certain of the mountain clans as well, and on Skagos\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, only heart trees ever see half of what they do on Skagos.\n\u201cThis miller\u2019s marriage had been performed without my leave or knowledge. The man had cheated me. So I had him hanged, and claimed my rights beneath the tree where he was swaying. If truth be told, the wench was hardly worth the rope. The fox escaped as well, and on our way back to the Dreadfort my favorite courser came up lame, so all in all it was a dismal day.\n\u201cA year later this same wench had the impudence to turn up at the Dreadfort with a squalling, red-faced monster that she claimed was my own get. I should\u2019ve had the mother whipped and thrown her child down a well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the babe did have my eyes. She told me that when her dead husband\u2019s brother saw those eyes, he beat her bloody and drove her from the mill. That annoyed me, so I gave her the mill and had the brother\u2019s tongue cut out, to make certain he did not go running to Winterfell with tales that might disturb Lord Rickard. Each year I sent the woman some piglets and chickens and a bag of stars, on the understanding that she was never to tell the boy who had fathered him. A peaceful land, a quiet people, that has always been my rule.\u201d\n\u201cA fine rule, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cThe woman disobeyed me, though. You see what Ramsay is. She made him, her and Reek, always whispering in his ear about his rights. He should have been content to grind corn. Does he truly think that he can ever rule the north?\u201d\n\u201cHe fights for you,\u201d Reek blurted out. \u201cHe\u2019s strong.\u201d\n\u201cBulls are strong. Bears. I have seen my bastard fight. He is not entirely to blame. Reek was his tutor, the first Reek, and Reek was never trained at arms. Ramsay is ferocious, I will grant you, but he swings that sword like a butcher hacking meat.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of anyone, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cHe should be. Fear is what keeps a man alive in this world of treachery and deceit. Even here in Barrowton the crows are circling, waiting to feast upon our flesh. The Cerwyns and the Tallharts are not to be relied on, my fat friend Lord Wyman plots betrayal, and Whoresbane\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the Umbers may seem simple, but they are not without a certain low cunning. Ramsay should fear them all, as I do. The next time you see him, tell him that.\u201d\n\u201cTell him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0tell him to be afraid?\u201d Reek felt ill at the very thought of it. \u201cM\u2019lord, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if I did that, he\u2019d\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Lord Bolton sighed. \u201cHis blood is bad. He needs to be leeched. The leeches suck away the bad blood, all the rage and pain. No man can think so full of anger. Ramsay, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0his tainted blood would poison even leeches, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cHe is your only son.\u201d\n\u201cFor the moment. I had another, once. Domeric. A quiet boy, but most accomplished. He served four years as Lady Dustin\u2019s page, and three in the Vale as a squire to Lord Redfort. He played the high harp, read histories, and rode like the wind. Horses\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the boy was mad for horses, Lady Dustin will tell you. Not even Lord Rickard\u2019s daughter could outrace him, and that one was half a horse herself. Redfort said he showed great promise in the lists. A great jouster must be a great horseman first.\u201d\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord. Domeric. I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have heard his name\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRamsay killed him. A sickness of the bowels, Maester Uthor says, but I say poison. In the Vale, Domeric had enjoyed the company of Redfort\u2019s sons. He wanted a brother by his side, so he rode up the Weeping Water to seek my bastard out. I forbade it, but Domeric was a man grown and thought that he knew better than his father. Now his bones lie beneath the Dreadfort with the bones of his brothers, who died still in the cradle, and I am left with Ramsay. Tell me, my lord\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if the kinslayer is accursed, what is a father to do when one son slays another?\u201d\nThe question frightened him. Once he had heard Skinner say that the Bastard had killed his trueborn brother, but he had never dared to believe it. He could be wrong. Brothers die sometimes, it does not mean that they were killed. My brothers died, and I never killed them. \u201cMy lord has a new wife to give him sons.\u201d\n\u201cAnd won\u2019t my bastard love that? Lady Walda is a Frey, and she has a fertile feel to her. I have become oddly fond of my fat little wife. The two before her never made a sound in bed, but this one squeals and shudders. I find that quite endearing. If she pops out sons the way she pops in tarts, the Dreadfort will soon be overrun with Boltons. Ramsay will kill them all, of course. That\u2019s for the best. I will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood, and boy lords are the bane of any House. Walda will grieve to see them die, though.\u201d\nReek\u2019s throat was dry. He could hear the wind rattling the bare branches of the elms that lined the street. \u201cMy lord, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord, remember?\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord. If I might ask\u00a0\u2026\u00a0why did you want me? I\u2019m no use to anyone, I\u2019m not even a man, I\u2019m broken, and\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the smell\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA bath and change of clothes will make you smell sweeter.\u201d\n\u201cA bath?\u201d Reek felt a clenching in his guts. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I would sooner not, m\u2019lord. Please. I have\u00a0\u2026\u00a0wounds, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and these clothes, Lord Ramsay gave them to me, he\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he said that I was never to take them off, save at his command\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou are wearing rags,\u201d Lord Bolton said, quite patiently. \u201cFilthy things, torn and stained and stinking of blood and urine. And thin. You must be cold. We\u2019ll put you in lambswool, soft and warm. Perhaps a fur-lined cloak. Would you like that?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He could not let them take the clothes Lord Ramsay gave him. He could not let them see him.\n\u201cWould you prefer to dress in silk and velvet? There was a time when you were fond of such, I do recall.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted, shrilly. \u201cNo, I only want these clothes. Reek\u2019s clothes. I\u2019m Reek, it rhymes with peek.\u201d His heart was beating like a drum, and his voice rose to a frightened squeak. \u201cI don\u2019t want a bath. Please, m\u2019lord, don\u2019t take my clothes.\u201d\n\u201cWill you let us wash them, at least?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, m\u2019lord. Please.\u201d He clutched his tunic to his chest with both hands and hunched down in the saddle, half-afraid that Roose Bolton might command his guardsmen to tear the clothes off him right there in the street.\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Bolton\u2019s pale eyes looked empty in the moonlight, as if there were no one behind them at all. \u201cI mean you no harm, you know. I owe you much and more.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Some part of him was screaming, This is a trap, he is playing with you, the son is just the shadow of the father. Lord Ramsay played with his hopes all the time. \u201cWhat\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what do you owe me, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cThe north. The Starks were done and doomed the night that you took Winterfell.\u201d He waved a pale hand, dismissive. \u201cAll this is only squabbling over spoils.\u201d\nTheir short journey reached its end at the wooden walls of Barrow Hall. Banners flew from its square towers, flapping in the wind: the flayed man of the Dreadfort, the battle-axe of Cerwyn, Tallhart\u2019s pines, the merman of Manderly, old Lord Locke\u2019s crossed keys, the Umber giant and the stony hand of Flint, the Hornwood moose. For the Stouts, chevrony russet and gold, for Slate, a grey field within a double tressure white. Four horseheads proclaimed the four Ryswells of the Rills\u2014one grey, one black, one gold, one brown. The jape was that the Ryswells could not even agree upon the color of their arms. Above them streamed the stag-and-lion of the boy who sat upon the Iron Throne a thousand leagues away.\nReek listened to the vanes turning on the old windmill as they rode beneath the gatehouse into a grassy courtyard where stableboys ran out to take their horses. \u201cThis way, if you please.\u201d Lord Bolton led him toward the keep, where the banners were those of the late Lord Dustin and his widowed wife. His showed a spiked crown above crossed longaxes; hers quartered those same arms with Rodrik Ryswell\u2019s golden horsehead.\nAs he climbed a wide flight of wooden steps to the hall, Reek\u2019s legs began to shake. He had to stop to steady them, staring up at the grassy slopes of the Great Barrow. Some claimed it was the grave of the First King, who had led the First Men to Westeros. Others argued that it must be some King of the Giants who was buried there, to account for its size. A few had even been known to say it was no barrow, just a hill, but if so it was a lonely hill, for most of the barrowlands were flat and windswept.\nInside the hall, a woman stood beside the hearth, warming thin hands above the embers of a dying fire. She was clad all in black, from head to heel, and wore no gold nor gems, but she was highborn, that was plain to see. Though there were wrinkles at the corners of her mouth and more around her eyes, she still stood tall, unbent, and handsome. Her hair was brown and grey in equal parts and she wore it tied behind her head in a widow\u2019s knot.\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the boy? Did your bastard refuse to give him up? Is this old man his\u00a0\u2026\u00a0oh, gods be good, what is that smell? Has this creature soiled himself?\u201d\n\u201cHe has been with Ramsay. Lady Barbrey, allow me to present the rightful Lord of the Iron Islands, Theon of House Greyjoy.\u201d\nNo, he thought, no, don\u2019t say that name, Ramsay will hear you, he\u2019ll know, he\u2019ll know, he\u2019ll hurt me.\nHer mouth pursed. \u201cHe is not what I expected.\u201d\n\u201cHe is what we have.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did your bastard do to him?\u201d\n\u201cRemoved some skin, I would imagine. A few small parts. Nothing too essential.\u201d\n\u201cIs he mad?\u201d\n\u201cHe may be. Does it matter?\u201d\nReek could hear no more. \u201cPlease, m\u2019lord, m\u2019lady, there\u2019s been some mistake.\u201d He fell to his knees, trembling like a leaf in a winter storm, tears streaming down his ravaged cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not him, I\u2019m not the turncloak, he died at Winterfell. My name is Reek.\u201d He had to remember his name. \u201cIt rhymes with freak.\u201d",

      "content": "TYRION\nThe Selaesori Qhoran was seven days from Volantis when Penny finally emerged from her cabin, creeping up on deck like some timid woodland creature emerging from a long winter\u2019s sleep.\nIt was dusk and the red priest had lit his nightfire in the great iron brazier amidships as the crew gathered round to pray. Moqorro\u2019s voice was a bass drum that seemed to boom from somewhere deep within his massive torso. \u201cWe thank you for your sun that keeps us warm,\u201d he prayed. \u201cWe thank you for your stars that watch over us as we sail this cold black sea.\u201d A huge man, taller than Ser Jorah and wide enough to make two of him, the priest wore scarlet robes embroidered at sleeve and hem and collar with orange satin flames. His skin was black as pitch, his hair as white as snow; the flames tattooed across his cheeks and brow yellow and orange. His iron staff was as tall as he was and crowned with a dragon\u2019s head; when he stamped its butt upon the deck, the dragon\u2019s maw spat crackling green flame.\nHis guardsmen, five slave warriors of the Fiery Hand, led the responses. They chanted in the tongue of Old Volantis, but Tyrion had heard the prayers enough to grasp the essence. Light our fire and protect us from the dark, blah blah, light our way and keep us toasty warm, the night is dark and full of terrors, save us from the scary things, and blah blah blah some more.\nHe knew better than to voice such thoughts aloud. Tyrion Lannister had no use for any god, but on this ship it was wise to show a certain respect for red R\u2019hllor. Jorah Mormont had removed Tyron\u2019s chains and fetters once they were safely under way, and the dwarf did not wish to give him cause to clap them on again.\nThe Selaesori Qhoran was a wallowing tub of five hundred tons, with a deep hold, high castles fore and aft, and a single mast between. At her forecastle stood a grotesque figurehead, some worm-eaten wooden eminence with a constipated look and a scroll tucked up under one arm. Tyrion had never seen an uglier ship. Her crew was no prettier. Her captain, a mean-mouthed, flinty, kettle-bellied man with close-set, greedy eyes, was a bad cyvasse player and a worse loser. Under him served four mates, freedmen all, and fifty slaves bound to the ship, each with a crude version of the cog\u2019s figurehead tattooed upon one cheek. No-Nose, the sailors liked to call Tyrion, no matter how many times he told them his name was Hugor Hill.\nThree of the mates and more than three-quarters of the crew were fervent worshipers of the Lord of Light. Tyrion was less certain about the captain, who always emerged for the evening prayers but took no other part in them. But Moqorro was the true master of the Selaesori Qhoran, at least for this voyage.\n\u201cLord of Light, bless your slave Moqorro, and light his way in the dark places of the world,\u201d the red priest boomed. \u201cAnd defend your righteous slave Benerro. Grant him courage. Grant him wisdom. Fill his heart with fire.\u201d\nThat was when Tyrion noticed Penny, watching the mummery from the steep wooden stair that led down beneath the sterncastle. She stood on one of the lower steps, so only the top of her head was visible. Beneath her hood her eyes shone big and white in the light of the nightfire. She had her dog with her, the big grey hound she rode in the mock jousts.\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d Tyrion called softly. In truth, she was no lady, but he could not bring himself to mouth that silly name of hers, and he was not about to call her girl or dwarf.\nShe cringed back. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I did not see you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am small.\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I was unwell\u00a0\u2026\u201d Her dog barked.\nSick with grief, you mean. \u201cIf I can be of help\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d And quick as that she was gone again, retreating back below to the cabin she shared with her dog and sow. Tyrion could not fault her. The crew of the Selaesori Qhoran had been pleased enough when he first came on board; a dwarf was good luck, after all. His head had been rubbed so often and so vigorously that it was a wonder he wasn\u2019t bald. But Penny had met with a more mixed reaction. She might be a dwarf, but she was also a woman, and women were bad luck aboard ship. For every man who tried to rub her head, there were three who muttered maledictions under their breath when she went by.\nAnd the sight of me can only be salt in her wound. They hacked off her brother\u2019s head in the hope that it was mine, yet here I sit like some bloody gargoyle, offering empty consolations. If I were her, I\u2019d want nothing more than to shove me into the sea.\nHe felt nothing but pity for the girl. She did not deserve the horror visited on her in Volantis, any more than her brother had. The last time he had seen her, just before they left port, her eyes had been raw from crying, two ghastly red holes in a wan, pale face. By the time they raised sail she had locked herself in her cabin with her dog and her pig, but at night they could hear her weeping. Only yesterday he had heard one of the mates say that they ought to throw her overboard before her tears could swamp the ship. Tyrion was not entirely sure he had been japing.\nWhen the evening prayers had ended and the ship\u2019s crew had once again dispersed, some to their watch and others to food and rum and hammocks, Moqorro remained beside his nightfire, as he did every night. The red priest rested by day but kept vigil through the dark hours, to tend his sacred flames so that the sun might return to them at dawn.\nTyrion squatted across from him and warmed his hands against the night\u2019s chill. Moqorro took no notice of him for several moments. He was staring into the flickering flames, lost in some vision. Does he see days yet to come, as he claims? If so, that was a fearsome gift. After a time the priest raised his eyes to meet the dwarf\u2019s. \u201cHugor Hill,\u201d he said, inclining his head in a solemn nod. \u201cHave you come to pray with me?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone told me that the night is dark and full of terrors. What do you see in those flames?\u201d\n\u201cDragons,\u201d Moqorro said in the Common Tongue of Westeros. He spoke it very well, with hardly a trace of accent. No doubt that was one reason the high priest Benerro had chosen him to bring the faith of R\u2019hllor to Daenerys Targaryen. \u201cDragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark. And you. A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of all.\u201d\n\u201cSnarling? An amiable fellow like me?\u201d Tyrion was almost flattered. And no doubt that is just what he intends. Every fool loves to hear that he\u2019s important. \u201cPerhaps it was Penny you saw. We\u2019re almost of a size.\u201d\n\u201cNo, my friend.\u201d\nMy friend? When did that happen, I wonder? \u201cDid you see how long it will take us to reach Meereen?\u201d\n\u201cYou are eager to behold the world\u2019s deliverer?\u201d\nYes and no. The world\u2019s deliverer may snick off my head or give me to her dragons as a savory. \u201cNot me,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cFor me, it is all about the olives. Though I fear I may grow old and die before I taste one. I could dog-paddle faster than we\u2019re sailing. Tell me, was Selaesori Qhoran a triarch or a turtle?\u201d\nThe red priest chuckled. \u201cNeither. Qhoran is\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not a ruler, but one who serves and counsels such, and helps conduct his business. You of Westeros might say steward or magister.\u201d\nKing\u2019s Hand? That amused him. \u201cAnd selaesori?\u201d\nMoqorro touched his nose. \u201cImbued with a pleasant aroma. Fragrant, would you say? Flowery?\u201d\n\u201cSo Selaesori Qhoran means Stinky Steward, more or less?\u201d\n\u201cFragrant Steward, rather.\u201d\nTyrion gave a crooked grin. \u201cI believe I will stay with Stinky. But I do thank you for the lesson.\u201d\n\u201cI am pleased to have enlightened you. Perhaps someday you will let me teach you the truth of R\u2019hllor as well.\u201d\n\u201cSomeday.\u201d When I am a head on a spike.\nThe quarters he shared with Ser Jorah were a cabin only by courtesy; the dank, dark, foul-smelling closet had barely enough space to hang a pair of sleeping hammocks, one above the other. He found Mormont stretched out in the lower one, swaying slowly with the motion of the ship. \u201cThe girl finally poked her nose abovedecks,\u201d Tyrion told him. \u201cOne look at me and she scurried right back down below.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a pretty sight.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of us can be as comely as you. The girl is lost. It would not surprise me if the poor creature wasn\u2019t sneaking up to jump over the side and drown herself.\u201d\n\u201cThe poor creature\u2019s name is Penny.\u201d\n\u201cI know her name.\u201d He hated her name. Her brother had gone by the name of Groat, though his true name had been Oppo. Groat and Penny. The smallest coins, worth the least, and what\u2019s worse, they chose the names themselves. It left a bad taste in Tyrion\u2019s mouth. \u201cBy any name, she needs a friend.\u201d\nSer Jorah sat up in his hammock. \u201cBefriend her, then. Marry her, for all I care.\u201d\nThat left a bad taste in his mouth as well. \u201cLike with like, is that your notion? Do you mean to find a she-bear for yourself, ser?\u201d\n\u201cYou were the one who insisted that we bring her.\u201d\n\u201cI said we could not abandon her in Volantis. That does not mean I want to fuck her. She wants me dead, have you forgotten? I\u2019m the last person she\u2019s like to want as a friend.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re both dwarfs.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and so was her brother, who was killed because some drunken fools took him for me.\u201d\n\u201cFeeling guilty, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tyrion bristled. \u201cI have sins enough to answer for; I\u2019ll have no part of this one. I might have nurtured some ill will toward her and her brother for the part they played the night of Joffrey\u2019s wedding, but I never wished them harm.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a harmless creature, to be sure. Innocent as a lamb.\u201d Ser Jorah got to his feet. \u201cThe dwarf girl is your burden. Kiss her, kill her, or avoid her, as you like. It\u2019s naught to me.\u201d He shouldered past Tyrion and out of the cabin.\nTwice exiled, and small wonder, Tyrion thought. I\u2019d exile him too if I could. The man is cold, brooding, sullen, deaf to humor. And those are his good points. Ser Jorah spent most of his waking hours pacing the forecastle or leaning on the rail, gazing out to sea. Looking for his silver queen. Looking for Daenerys, willing the ship to sail faster. Well, I might do the same if Tysha waited in Meereen.\nCould Slaver\u2019s Bay be where whores went? It seemed unlikely. From what he\u2019d read, the slaver cities were the place where whores were made. Mormont should have bought one for himself. A pretty slave girl might have done wonders to improve his temper\u00a0\u2026\u00a0particularly one with silvery hair, like the whore who had been sitting on his cock back in Selhorys.\nOn the river Tyrion had to endure Griff, but there had at least been the mystery of the captain\u2019s true identity to divert him and the more congenial companionship of the rest of the poleboat\u2019s little company. On the cog, alas, everyone was just who they appeared to be, no one was particularly congenial, and only the red priest was interesting. Him, and maybe Penny. But the girl hates me, and she should.\nLife aboard the Selaesori Qhoran was nothing if not tedious, Tyrion had found. The most exciting part of his day was pricking his toes and fingers with a knife. On the river there had been wonders to behold: giant turtles, ruined cities, stone men, naked septas. One never knew what might be lurking around the next bend. The days and nights at sea were all the same. Leaving Volantis, the cog had sailed within sight of land at first, so Tyrion could gaze at passing headlands, watch clouds of seabirds rise from stony cliffs and crumbling watchtowers, count bare brown islands as they slipped past. He saw many other ships as well: fishing boats, lumbering merchantmen, proud galleys with their oars lashing the waves into white foam. But once they struck out into deeper waters, there was only sea and sky, air and water. The water looked like water. The sky looked like sky. Sometimes there was a cloud. Too much blue.\nAnd the nights were worse. Tyrion slept badly at the best of times, and this was far from that. Sleep meant dreams as like as not, and in his dreams the Sorrows waited, and a stony king with his father\u2019s face. That left him with the beggar\u2019s choice of climbing up into his hammock and listening to Jorah Mormont snore beneath him, or remaining abovedecks to contemplate the sea. On moonless nights the water was as black as maester\u2019s ink, from horizon to horizon. Dark and deep and forbidding, beautiful in a chilly sort of way, but when he looked at it too long Tyrion found himself musing on how easy it would be to slip over the gunwale and drop down into that darkness. One very small splash, and the pathetic little tale that was his life would soon be done. But what if there is a hell and my father\u2019s waiting for me?\nThe best part of each evening was supper. The food was not especially good, but it was plentiful, so that was where the dwarf went next. The galley where he took his meals was a cramped and uncomfortable space, with a ceiling so low that the taller passengers were always in danger of cracking their heads, a hazard the strapping slave soldiers of the Fiery Hand seemed particularly prone to. As much as Tyrion enjoyed sniggering at that, he had come to prefer taking his meals alone. Sitting at a crowded table with men who did not share a common language with you, listening to them talk and jape whilst understanding none of it, had quickly grown wearisome. Particularly since he always found himself wondering if the japes and laughter were directed at him.\nThe galley was also where the ship\u2019s books were kept. Her captain being an especially bookish man, she carried three\u2014a collection of nautical poetry that went from bad to worse, a well-thumbed tome about the erotic adventures of a young slave girl in a Lysene pillow house, and the fourth and final volume of The Life of the Triarch Belicho, a famous Volantene patriot whose unbroken succession of conquests and triumphs ended rather abruptly when he was eaten by giants. Tyrion had finished them all by their third day at sea. Then, for lack of any other books, he started reading them again. The slave girl\u2019s story was the worst written but the most engrossing, and that was the one he took down this evening to see him through a supper of buttered beets, cold fish stew, and biscuits that could have been used to drive nails.\nHe was reading the girl\u2019s account of the day she and her sister were taken by slavers when Penny entered the galley. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I did not mean to disturb m\u2019lord, I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou are not disturbing me. You\u2019re not going to try to kill me again, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She looked away, her face reddening.\n\u201cIn that case, I would welcome some company. There\u2019s little enough aboard this ship.\u201d Tyrion closed the book. \u201cCome. Sit. Eat.\u201d The girl had left most of her meals untouched outside her cabin door. By now she must be starving. \u201cThe stew is almost edible. The fish is fresh, at least.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I choked on a fish bone once, I can\u2019t eat fish.\u201d\n\u201cHave some wine, then.\u201d He filled a cup and slid it toward her. \u201cCompliments of our captain. Closer to piss than Arbor gold, if truth be told, but even piss tastes better than the black tar rum the sailors drink. It might help you sleep.\u201d\nThe girl made no move to touch the cup. \u201cThank you, m\u2019lord, but no.\u201d She backed away. \u201cI should not be bothering you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to spend your whole life running away?\u201d Tyrion asked before she could slip back out the door.\nThat stopped her. Her cheeks turned a bright pink, and he was afraid she was about to start weeping again. Instead she thrust out her lip defiantly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re running too.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d he confessed, \u201cbut I am running to and you are running from, and there\u2019s a world of difference there.\u201d\n\u201cWe would never have had to run at all but for you.\u201d\nIt took some courage to say that to my face. \u201cAre you speaking of King\u2019s Landing or Volantis?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d Tears glistened in her eyes. \u201cEverything. Why couldn\u2019t you just come joust with us, the way the king wanted? You wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt. What would that have cost m\u2019lord, to climb up on our dog and ride a tilt to please the boy? It was just a bit of fun. They would have laughed at you, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cThey would have laughed at me,\u201d said Tyrion. I made them laugh at Joff instead. And wasn\u2019t that a clever ploy?\n\u201cMy brother says that is a good thing, making people laugh. A noble thing, and honorable. My brother says\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u00a0\u2026\u201d The tears fell then, rolling down her face.\n\u201cI am sorry about your brother.\u201d Tyrion had said the same words to her before, back in Volantis, but she was so far gone in grief back there that he doubted she had heard them.\nShe heard them now. \u201cSorry. You are sorry.\u201d Her lip was trembling, her cheeks were wet, her eyes were red-rimmed holes. \u201cWe left King\u2019s Landing that very night. My brother said it was for the best, before someone wondered if we\u2019d had some part in the king\u2019s death and decided to torture us to find out. We went to Tyrosh first. My brother thought that would be far enough, but it wasn\u2019t. We knew a juggler there. For years and years he would juggle every day by the Fountain of the Drunken God. He was old, so his hands were not as deft as they had been, and sometimes he would drop his balls and chase them across the square, but the Tyroshi would laugh and throw him coins all the same. Then one morning we heard that his body had been found at the Temple of Trios. Trios has three heads, and there\u2019s a big statue of him beside the temple doors. The old man had been cut into three parts and pushed inside the threefold mouths of Trios. Only when the parts were sewn back together, his head was gone.\u201d\n\u201cA gift for my sweet sister. He was another dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cA little man, aye. Like you, and Oppo. Groat. Are you sorry about the juggler too?\u201d\n\u201cI never knew your juggler existed until this very moment\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but yes, I am sorry he is dead.\u201d\n\u201cHe died for you. His blood is on your hands.\u201d\nThe accusation stung, coming so hard on the heels of Jorah Mormont\u2019s words. \u201cHis blood is on my sister\u2019s hands, and the hands of the brutes who killed him. My hands\u00a0\u2026\u201d Tyrion turned them over, inspected them, coiled them into fists. \u201c\u2026\u00a0my hands are crusted with old blood, aye. Call me kinslayer, and you won\u2019t be wrong. Kingslayer, I\u2019ll answer to that one as well. I have killed mothers, fathers, nephews, lovers, men and women, kings and whores. A singer once annoyed me, so I had the bastard stewed. But I have never killed a juggler, nor a dwarf, and I am not to blame for what happened to your bloody brother.\u201d\nPenny picked the cup of wine he\u2019d poured for her and threw it in his face. Just like my sweet sister. He heard the galley door slam but never saw her leave. His eyes were stinging, and the world was a blur. So much for befriending her.\nTyrion Lannister had scant experience with other dwarfs. His lord father had not welcomed any reminders of his son\u2019s deformities, and such mummers as featured little folk in their troupes soon learned to stay away from Lannisport and Casterly Rock, at the risk of his displeasure. Growing up, Tyrion heard reports of a dwarf jester at the seat of the Dornish Lord Fowler, a dwarf maester in service on the Fingers, and a female dwarf amongst the silent sisters, but he never felt the least need to seek them out. Less reliable tales also reached his ears, of a dwarf witch who haunted a hill in the riverlands, and a dwarf whore in King\u2019s Landing renowned for coupling with dogs. His own sweet sister had told him of the last, even offering to find him a bitch in heat if he cared to try it out. When he asked politely if she were referring to herself, Cersei had thrown a cup of wine in his face. That was red, as I recall, and this is gold. Tyrion mopped at his face with a sleeve. His eyes still stung.\nHe did not see Penny again until the day of the storm.\nThe salt air lay still and heavy that morning, but the western sky was a fiery red, streaked with lowering clouds that glowed as bright as Lannister crimson. Sailors were dashing about battening hatches, running lines, clearing the decks, lashing down everything that was not already lashed down. \u201cBad wind coming,\u201d one warned him. \u201cNo-Nose should get below.\u201d\nTyrion remembered the storm he\u2019d suffered crossing the narrow sea, the way the deck had jumped beneath his feet, the hideous creaking sounds the ship had made, the taste of wine and vomit. \u201cNo-Nose will stay up here.\u201d If the gods wanted him, he would sooner die by drowning than choking on his own vomit. And overhead the cog\u2019s canvas sail rippled slowly, like the fur of some great beast stirring from a long sleep, then filled with a sudden crack that turned every head on the ship.\nThe winds drove the cog before them, far off her chosen course. Behind them black clouds piled one atop another against a blood-red sky. By midmorning they could see lightning flickering to the west, followed by the distant crash of thunder. The sea grew rougher, and dark waves rose up to smash against the hull of the Stinky Steward. It was about then that the crew started hauling down the canvas. Tyrion was underfoot amidships, so he climbed the forecastle and hunkered down, savoring the lash of cold rain on his cheeks. The cog went up and down, bucking more wildly than any horse he\u2019d ever ridden, lifting with each wave before sliding down into the troughs between, jarring him to the bones. Even so, it was better here where he could see than down below locked in some airless cabin.\nBy the time the storm broke, evening was upon them and Tyrion Lannister was soaked through to the smallclothes, yet somehow he felt elated\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and even more so later, when he found a drunken Jorah Mormont in a pool of vomit in their cabin.\nThe dwarf lingered in the galley after supper, celebrating his survival by sharing a few tots of black tar rum with the ship\u2019s cook, a great greasy loutish Volantene who spoke only one word of the Common Tongue (fuck), but played a ferocious game of cyvasse, particularly when drunk. They played three games that night. Tyrion won the first, then lost the other two. After that he decided that he\u2019d had enough and stumbled back up on deck to clear his head of rum and elephants alike.\nHe found Penny on the forecastle, where he had so often found Ser Jorah, standing by the rail beside the cog\u2019s hideous half-rotted figurehead and gazing out across the inky sea. From behind, she looked as small and vulnerable as a child.\nTyrion thought it best to leave her undisturbed, but it was too late. She had heard him. \u201cHugor Hill.\u201d\n\u201cIf you like.\u201d We both know better. \u201cI am sorry to intrude on you. I will retire.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her face was pale and sad, but she did not look to have been crying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. About the wine. It wasn\u2019t you who killed my brother or that poor old man in Tyrosh.\u201d\n\u201cI played a part, though not by choice.\u201d\n\u201cI miss him so much. My brother. I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d He found himself thinking of Jaime. Count yourself lucky. Your brother died before he could betray you.\n\u201cI thought I wanted to die,\u201d she said, \u201cbut today when the storm came and I thought the ship would sink, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou realized that you wanted to live after all.\u201d I have been there too. Something else we have in common.\nHer teeth were crooked, which made her shy with her smiles, but she smiled now. \u201cDid you truly cook a singer in a stew?\u201d\n\u201cWho, me? No. I do not cook.\u201d\nWhen Penny giggled, she sounded like the sweet young girl she was\u00a0\u2026\u00a0seventeen, eighteen, no more than nineteen. \u201cWhat did he do, this singer?\u201d\n\u201cHe wrote a song about me.\u201d For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss. And a chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman\u2019s kiss. It was queer how quick the words came back to him. Perhaps they had never left him. Hands of gold are always cold, but a woman\u2019s hands are warm.\n\u201cIt must have been a very bad song.\u201d\n\u201cNot really. It was no \u2018Rains of Castamere,\u2019 mind you, but some parts were\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cNo. You do not want to hear me sing.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother used to sing to us when we were children. My brother and me. She always said that it didn\u2019t matter what your voice was like so long as you loved the song.\u201d\n\u201cWas she \u2026?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0a little person? No, but our father was. His own father sold him to a slaver when he was three, but he grew up to be such a famous mummer that he bought his freedom. He traveled to all the Free Cities, and Westeros as well. In Oldtown they used to call him Hop-Bean.\u201d\nOf course they did. Tyrion tried not to wince.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead now,\u201d Penny went on. \u201cMy mother too. Oppo\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he was my last family, and now he\u2019s gone too.\u201d She turned her head away and gazed out across the sea. \u201cWhat will I do? Where will I go? I have no trade, just the jousting show, and that needs two.\u201d\nNo, thought Tyrion. That is not a place you want to go, girl. Do not ask that of me. Do not even think it. \u201cFind yourself some likely orphan boy,\u201d he suggested.\nPenny did not seem to hear that. \u201cIt was Father\u2019s idea to do the tilts. He even trained the first pig, but by then he was too sick to ride her, so Oppo took his place. I always rode the dog. We performed for the Sealord of Braavos once, and he laughed so hard that afterward he gave each of us a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a grand gift.\u201d\n\u201cIs that where my sister found you? In Braavos?\u201d\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d The girl looked lost.\n\u201cQueen Cersei.\u201d\nPenny shook her head. \u201cShe never\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it was a man who came to us, in Pentos. Osmund. No, Oswald. Something like that. Oppo met with him, not me. Oppo made all of our arrangements. My brother always knew what to do, where we should go next.\u201d\n\u201cMeereen is where we\u2019re going next.\u201d\nShe gave him a puzzled look. \u201cQarth, you mean. We\u2019re bound for Qarth, by way of New Ghis.\u201d\n\u201cMeereen. You\u2019ll ride your dog for the dragon queen and come away with your weight in gold. Best start eating more, so you\u2019ll be nice and plump when you joust before Her Grace.\u201d\nPenny did not return the smile. \u201cBy myself, all I can do is ride around in circles. And even if the queen should laugh, where will I go afterward? We never stay in one place long. The first time they see us they laugh and laugh, but by the fourth or fifth time, they know what we\u2019re going to do before we do it. Then they stop laughing, so we have to go somewhere new. We make the most coin in the big cities, but I always liked the little towns the best. Places like that, the people have no silver, but they feed us at their own tables, and the children follow us everywhere.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because they have never seen a dwarf before, in their wretched pisspot towns, Tyrion thought. The bloody brats would follow around a two-headed goat if one turned up. Until they got bored with its bleating and slaughtered it for supper. But he had no wish to make her weep again, so instead he said, \u201cDaenerys has a kind heart and a generous nature.\u201d It was what she needed to hear. \u201cShe will find a place for you at her court, I don\u2019t doubt. A safe place, beyond my sister\u2019s reach.\u201d\nPenny turned back to him. \u201cAnd you will be there too.\u201d\nUnless Daenerys decides she needs some Lannister blood, to pay for the Targaryen blood my brother shed. \u201cI will.\u201d\nAfter that, the dwarf girl was seen more frequently above deck. The next day Tyrion encountered her and her spotted sow amidships in midafternoon, when the air was warm and the sea calm. \u201cHer name is Pretty,\u201d the girl told him, shyly.\nPretty the pig and Penny the girl, he thought. Someone has a deal to answer for. Penny gave Tyrion some acorns, and he let Pretty eat them from his hand. Do not think I don\u2019t see what you are doing, girl, he thought, as the big sow snuffled and squealed.\nSoon they began to take their meals together. Some nights it was just the two of them; at other meals they crowded in with Moqorro\u2019s guards. The fingers, Tyrion called them; they were men of the Fiery Hand, after all, and there were five of them. Penny laughed at that, a sweet sound, though not one that he heard often. Her wound was too fresh, her grief too deep.\nHe soon had her calling the ship the Stinky Steward, though she got somewhat wroth with him whenever he called Pretty Bacon. To atone for that Tyrion made an attempt to teach her cyvasse, though he soon realized that was a lost cause. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, a dozen times, \u201cthe dragon flies, not the elephants.\u201d\nThat same night, she came right out and asked him if he would like to tilt with her. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. Only later did it occur to him that perhaps tilt did not mean tilt. His answer would still have been no, but he might not have been so brusque.\nBack in the cabin he shared with Jorah Mormont, Tyrion twisted in his hammock for hours, slipping in and out of sleep. His dreams were full of grey, stony hands reaching for him from out of the fog, and a stair that led up to his father.\nFinally he gave it up and made his way up top for a breath of night air. The Selaesori Qhoran had furled her big striped sail for the night, and her decks were all but deserted. One of the mates was on the sterncastle, and amidships Moqorro sat by his brazier, where a few small flames still danced amongst the embers.\nOnly the brightest stars were visible, all to the west. A dull red glow lit the sky to the northeast, the color of a blood bruise. Tyrion had never seen a bigger moon. Monstrous, swollen, it looked as if it had swallowed the sun and woken with a fever. Its twin, floating on the sea beyond the ship, shimmered red with every wave. \u201cWhat hour is this?\u201d he asked Moqorro. \u201cThat cannot be sunrise unless the east has moved. Why is the sky red?\u201d\n\u201cThe sky is always red above Valyria, Hugor Hill.\u201d\nA cold chill went down his back. \u201cAre we close?\u201d\n\u201cCloser than the crew would like,\u201d Moqorro said in his deep voice. \u201cDo you know the stories, in your Sunset Kingdoms?\u201d\n\u201cI know some sailors say that any man who lays eyes upon that coast is doomed.\u201d He did not believe such tales himself, no more than his uncle had. Gerion Lannister had set sail for Valyria when Tyrion was eighteen, intent on recovering the lost ancestral blade of House Lannister and any other treasures that might have survived the Doom. Tyrion had wanted desperately to go with them, but his lord father had dubbed the voyage a \u201cfool\u2019s quest,\u201d and forbidden him to take part.\nAnd perhaps he was not so wrong. Almost a decade had passed since the Laughing Lion headed out from Lannisport, and Gerion had never returned. The men Lord Tywin sent to seek after him had traced his course as far as Volantis, where half his crew had deserted him and he had bought slaves to replace them. No free man would willingly sign aboard a ship whose captain spoke openly of his intent to sail into the Smoking Sea. \u201cSo those are fires of the Fourteen Flames we\u2019re seeing, reflected on the clouds?\u201d\n\u201cFourteen or fourteen thousand. What man dares count them? It is not wise for mortals to look too deeply at those fires, my friend. Those are the fires of god\u2019s own wrath, and no human flame can match them. We are small creatures, men.\u201d\n\u201cSome smaller than others.\u201d Valyria. It was written that on the day of Doom every hill for five hundred miles had split asunder to fill the air with ash and smoke and fire, blazes so hot and hungry that even the dragons in the sky were engulfed and consumed. Great rents had opened in the earth, swallowing palaces, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery fountains spewed molten rock a thousand feet into the air, red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in. The proudest city in all the world was gone in an instant, its fabled empire vanished in a day, the Lands of the Long Summer scorched and drowned and blighted.\nAn empire built on blood and fire. The Valyrians reaped the seed they had sown. \u201cDoes our captain mean to test the curse?\u201d\n\u201cOur captain would prefer to be fifty leagues farther out to sea, well away from that accursed shore, but I have commanded him to steer the shortest course. Others seek Daenerys too.\u201d\nGriff, with his young prince. Could all that talk of the Golden Company sailing west have been a feint? Tyrion considered saying something, then thought better. It seemed to him that the prophecy that drove the red priests had room for just one hero. A second Targaryen would only serve to confuse them. \u201cHave you seen these others in your fires?\u201d he asked, warily.\n\u201cOnly their shadows,\u201d Moqorro said. \u201cOne most of all. A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood.\u201d",

      "content": "BRAN\nThe moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. A pale sun rose and set and rose again. Red leaves whispered in the wind. Dark clouds filled the skies and turned to storms. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, and dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes shuffled round a cleft in the hillside but could not enter. Under the hill, the broken boy sat upon a weirwood throne, listening to whispers in the dark as ravens walked up and down his arms.\n\u201cYou will never walk again,\u201d the three-eyed crow had promised, \u201cbut you will fly.\u201d Sometimes the sound of song would drift up from someplace far below. The children of the forest, Old Nan would have called the singers, but those who sing the song of earth was their own name for themselves, in the True Tongue that no human man could speak. The ravens could speak it, though. Their small black eyes were full of secrets, and they would caw at him and peck his skin when they heard the songs.\nThe moon was fat and full. Stars wheeled across a black sky. Rain fell and froze, and tree limbs snapped from the weight of the ice. Bran and Meera made up names for those who sang the song of earth: Ash and Leaf and Scales, Black Knife and Snowylocks and Coals. Their true names were too long for human tongues, said Leaf. Only she could speak the Common Tongue, so what the others thought of their new names Bran never learned.\nAfter the bone-grinding cold of the lands beyond the Wall, the caves were blessedly warm, and when the chill crept out of the rock the singers would light fires to drive it off again. Down here there was no wind, no snow, no ice, no dead things reaching out to grab you, only dreams and rushlight and the kisses of the ravens. And the whisperer in darkness.\nThe last greenseer, the singers called him, but in Bran\u2019s dreams he was still a three-eyed crow. When Meera Reed had asked him his true name, he made a ghastly sound that might have been a chuckle. \u201cI wore many names when I was quick, but even I once had a mother, and the name she gave me at her breast was Brynden.\u201d\n\u201cI have an uncle Brynden,\u201d Bran said. \u201cHe\u2019s my mother\u2019s uncle, really. Brynden Blackfish, he\u2019s called.\u201d\n\u201cYour uncle may have been named for me. Some are, still. Not so many as before. Men forget. Only the trees remember.\u201d His voice was so soft that Bran had to strain to hear.\n\u201cMost of him has gone into the tree,\u201d explained the singer Meera called Leaf. \u201cHe has lived beyond his mortal span, and yet he lingers. For us, for you, for the realms of men. Only a little strength remains in his flesh. He has a thousand eyes and one, but there is much to watch. One day you will know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will I know?\u201d Bran asked the Reeds afterward, when they came with torches burning brightly in their hand, to carry him back to a small chamber off the big cavern where the singers had made beds for them to sleep. \u201cWhat do the trees remember?\u201d\n\u201cThe secrets of the old gods,\u201d said Jojen Reed. Food and fire and rest had helped restore him after the ordeals of their journey, but he seemed sadder now, sullen, with a weary, haunted look about the eyes. \u201cTruths the First Men knew, forgotten now in Winterfell\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not in the wet wild. We live closer to the green in our bogs and crannogs, and we remember. Earth and water, soil and stone, oaks and elms and willows, they were here before us all and will still remain when we are gone.\u201d\n\u201cSo will you,\u201d said Meera. That made Bran sad. What if I don\u2019t want to remain when you are gone? he almost asked, but he swallowed the words unspoken. He was almost a man grown, and he did not want Meera to think he was some weepy babe. \u201cMaybe you could be greenseers too,\u201d he said instead.\n\u201cNo, Bran.\u201d Now Meera sounded sad.\n\u201cIt is given to a few to drink of that green fountain whilst still in mortal flesh, to hear the whisperings of the leaves and see as the trees see, as the gods see,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cMost are not so blessed. The gods gave me only greendreams. My task was to get you here. My part in this is done.\u201d\nThe moon was a black hole in the sky. Wolves howled in the wood, sniffing through the snowdrifts after dead things. A murder of ravens erupted from the hillside, screaming their sharp cries, black wings beating above a white world. A red sun rose and set and rose again, painting the snows in shades of rose and pink. Under the hill, Jojen brooded, Meera fretted, and Hodor wandered through dark tunnels with a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left. Or was it Bran wandering?\nNo one must ever know.\nThe great cavern that opened on the abyss was as black as pitch, black as tar, blacker than the feathers of a crow. Light entered as a trespasser, unwanted and unwelcome, and soon was gone again; cookfires, candles, and rushes burned for a little while, then guttered out again, their brief lives at an end.\nThe singers made Bran a throne of his own, like the one Lord Brynden sat, white weirwood flecked with red, dead branches woven through living roots. They placed it in the great cavern by the abyss, where the black air echoed to the sound of running water far below. Of soft grey moss they made his seat. Once he had been lowered into place, they covered him with warm furs.\nThere he sat, listening to the hoarse whispers of his teacher. \u201cNever fear the darkness, Bran.\u201d The lord\u2019s words were accompanied by a faint rustling of wood and leaf, a slight twisting of his head. \u201cThe strongest trees are rooted in the dark places of the earth. Darkness will be your cloak, your shield, your mother\u2019s milk. Darkness will make you strong.\u201d\nThe moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. Snowflakes drifted down soundlessly to cloak the soldier pines and sentinels in white. The drifts grew so deep that they covered the entrance to the caves, leaving a white wall that Summer had to dig through whenever he went outside to join his pack and hunt. Bran did not oft range with them in those days, but some nights he watched them from above.\nFlying was even better than climbing.\nSlipping into Summer\u2019s skin had become as easy for him as slipping on a pair of breeches once had been, before his back was broken. Changing his own skin for a raven\u2019s night-black feathers had been harder, but not as hard as he had feared, not with these ravens. \u201cA wild stallion will buck and kick when a man tries to mount him, and try to bite the hand that slips the bit between his teeth,\u201d Lord Brynden said, \u201cbut a horse that has known one rider will accept another. Young or old, these birds have all been ridden. Choose one now, and fly.\u201d\nHe chose one bird, and then another, without success, but the third raven looked at him with shrewd black eyes, tilted its head, and gave a quork, and quick as that he was not a boy looking at a raven but a raven looking at a boy. The song of the river suddenly grew louder, the torches burned a little brighter than before, and the air was full of strange smells. When he tried to speak it came out in a scream, and his first flight ended when he crashed into a wall and ended back inside his own broken body. The raven was unhurt. It flew to him and landed on his arm, and Bran stroked its feathers and slipped inside of it again. Before long he was flying around the cavern, weaving through the long stone teeth that hung down from the ceiling, even flapping out over the abyss and swooping down into its cold black depths.\nThen he realized he was not alone.\n\u201cSomeone else was in the raven,\u201d he told Lord Brynden, once he had returned to his own skin. \u201cSome girl. I felt her.\u201d\n\u201cA woman, of those who sing the song of earth,\u201d his teacher said. \u201cLong dead, yet a part of her remains, just as a part of you would remain in Summer if your boy\u2019s flesh were to die upon the morrow. A shadow on the soul. She will not harm you.\u201d\n\u201cDo all the birds have singers in them?\u201d\n\u201cAll,\u201d Lord Brynden said. \u201cIt was the singers who taught the First Men to send messages by raven\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but in those days, the birds would speak the words. The trees remember, but men forget, and so now they write the messages on parchment and tie them round the feet of birds who have never shared their skin.\u201d\nOld Nan had told him the same story once, Bran remembered, but when he asked Robb if it was true, his brother laughed and asked him if he believed in grumkins too. He wished Robb were with them now. I\u2019d tell him I could fly, but he wouldn\u2019t believe, so I\u2019d have to show him. I bet that he could learn to fly too, him and Arya and Sansa, even baby Rickon and Jon Snow. We could all be ravens and live in Maester Luwin\u2019s rookery.\nThat was just another silly dream, though. Some days Bran wondered if all of this wasn\u2019t just some dream. Maybe he had fallen asleep out in the snows and dreamed himself a safe, warm place. You have to wake, he would tell himself, you have to wake right now, or you\u2019ll go dreaming into death. Once or twice he pinched his arm with his fingers, really hard, but the only thing that did was make his arm hurt. In the beginning he had tried to count the days by making note of when he woke and slept, but down here sleeping and waking had a way of melting into one another. Dreams became lessons, lessons became dreams, things happened all at once or not at all. Had he done that or only dreamed it?\n\u201cOnly one man in a thousand is born a skinchanger,\u201d Lord Brynden said one day, after Bran had learned to fly, \u201cand only one skinchanger in a thousand can be a greenseer.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the greenseers were the wizards of the children,\u201d Bran said. \u201cThe singers, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cIn a sense. Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift. The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance. But once inside the wood they linger long indeed. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. Greenseers.\u201d\nBran did not understand, so he asked the Reeds. \u201cDo you like to read books, Bran?\u201d Jojen asked him.\n\u201cSome books. I like the fighting stories. My sister Sansa likes the kissing stories, but those are stupid.\u201d\n\u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cThe man who never reads lives only one. The singers of the forest had no books. No ink, no parchment, no written language. Instead they had the trees, and the weirwoods above all. When they died, they went into the wood, into leaf and limb and root, and the trees remembered. All their songs and spells, their histories and prayers, everything they knew about this world. Maesters will tell you that the weirwoods are sacred to the old gods. The singers believe they are the old gods. When singers die they become part of that godhood.\u201d\nBran\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Meera said. \u201cJojen, you\u2019re scaring him.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not the one who needs to be afraid.\u201d\nThe moon was fat and full. Summer prowled through the silent woods, a long grey shadow that grew more gaunt with every hunt, for living game could not be found. The ward upon the cave mouth still held; the dead men could not enter. The snows had buried most of them again, but they were still there, hidden, frozen, waiting. Other dead things came to join them, things that had once been men and women, even children. Dead ravens sat on bare brown branches, wings crusted with ice. A snow bear crashed through the brush, huge and skeletal, half its head sloughed away to reveal the skull beneath. Summer and his pack fell upon it and tore it into pieces. Afterward they gorged, though the meat was rotted and half-frozen, and moved even as they ate it.\nUnder the hill they still had food to eat. A hundred kinds of mushrooms grew down here. Blind white fish swam in the black river, but they tasted just as good as fish with eyes once you cooked them up. They had cheese and milk from the goats that shared the caves with the singers, even some oats and barleycorn and dried fruit laid by during the long summer. And almost every day they ate blood stew, thickened with barley and onions and chunks of meat. Jojen thought it might be squirrel meat, and Meera said that it was rat. Bran did not care. It was meat and it was good. The stewing made it tender.\nThe caves were timeless, vast, silent. They were home to more than three score living singers and the bones of thousands dead, and extended far below the hollow hill. \u201cMen should not go wandering in this place,\u201d Leaf warned them. \u201cThe river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to a sunless sea. And there are passages that go even deeper, bottomless pits and sudden shafts, forgotten ways that lead to the very center of the earth. Even my people have not explored them all, and we have lived here for a thousand thousand of your man-years.\u201d\nThough the men of the Seven Kingdoms might call them the children of the forest, Leaf and her people were far from childlike. Little wise men of the forest would have been closer. They were small compared to men, as a wolf is smaller than a direwolf. That does not mean it is a pup. They had nut-brown skin, dappled like a deer\u2019s with paler spots, and large ears that could hear things that no man could hear. Their eyes were big too, great golden cat\u2019s eyes that could see down passages where a boy\u2019s eyes saw only blackness. Their hands had only three fingers and a thumb, with sharp black claws instead of nails.\nAnd they did sing. They sang in True Tongue, so Bran could not understand the words, but their voices were as pure as winter air. \u201cWhere are the rest of you?\u201d Bran asked Leaf, once.\n\u201cGone down into the earth,\u201d she answered. \u201cInto the stones, into the trees. Before the First Men came all this land that you call Westeros was home to us, yet even in those days we were few. The gods gave us long lives but not great numbers, lest we overrun the world as deer will overrun a wood where there are no wolves to hunt them. That was in the dawn of days, when our sun was rising. Now it sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The great lions of the western hills have been slain, the unicorns are all but gone, the mammoths down to a few hundred. The direwolves will outlast us all, but their time will come as well. In the world that men have made, there is no room for them, or us.\u201d\nShe seemed sad when she said it, and that made Bran sad as well. It was only later that he thought, Men would not be sad. Men would be wroth. Men would hate and swear a bloody vengeance. The singers sing sad songs, where men would fight and kill.\nOne day Meera and Jojen decided to go see the river, despite Leaf\u2019s cautions. \u201cI want to come too,\u201d Bran said.\nMeera gave him a mournful look. The river was six hundred feet below, down steep slopes and twisty passages, she explained, and the last part required climbing down a rope. \u201cHodor could never make the climb with you on his back. I\u2019m sorry, Bran.\u201d\nBran remembered a time when no one could climb as good as him, not even Robb or Jon. Part of him wanted to shout at them for leaving him, and another part wanted to cry. He was almost a man grown, though, so he said nothing. But after they were gone, he slipped inside Hodor\u2019s skin and followed them.\nThe big stableboy no longer fought him as he had the first time, back in the lake tower during the storm. Like a dog who has had all the fight whipped out of him, Hodor would curl up and hide whenever Bran reached out for him. His hiding place was somewhere deep within him, a pit where not even Bran could touch him. No one wants to hurt you, Hodor, he said silently, to the child-man whose flesh he\u2019d taken. I just want to be strong again for a while. I\u2019ll give it back, the way I always do.\nNo one ever knew when he was wearing Hodor\u2019s skin. Bran only had to smile, do as he was told, and mutter \u201cHodor\u201d from time to time, and he could follow Meera and Jojen, grinning happily, without anyone suspecting it was really him. He often tagged along, whether he was wanted or not. In the end, the Reeds were glad he came. Jojen made it down the rope easily enough, but after Meera caught a blind white fish with her frog spear and it was time to climb back up, his arms began to tremble and he could not make it to the top, so they had to tie the rope around him and let Hodor haul him up. \u201cHodor,\u201d he grunted every time he gave a pull. \u201cHodor, hodor, hodor.\u201d\nThe moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. Summer dug up a severed arm, black and covered with hoarfrost, its fingers opening and closing as it pulled itself across the frozen snow. There was still enough meat on it to fill his empty belly, and after that was done he cracked the arm bones for the marrow. Only then did the arm remember it was dead.\nBran ate with Summer and his pack, as a wolf. As a raven he flew with the murder, circling the hill at sunset, watching for foes, feeling the icy touch of the air. As Hodor he explored the caves. He found chambers full of bones, shafts that plunged deep into the earth, a place where the skeletons of gigantic bats hung upside down from the ceiling. He even crossed the slender stone bridge that arched over the abyss and discovered more passages and chambers on the far side. One was full of singers, enthroned like Brynden in nests of weirwood roots that wove under and through and around their bodies. Most of them looked dead to him, but as he crossed in front of them their eyes would open and follow the light of his torch, and one of them opened and closed a wrinkled mouth as if he were trying to speak. \u201cHodor,\u201d Bran said to him, and he felt the real Hodor stir down in his pit.\nSeated on his throne of roots in the great cavern, half-corpse and half-tree, Lord Brynden seemed less a man than some ghastly statue made of twisted wood, old bone, and rotted wool. The only thing that looked alive in the pale ruin that was his face was his one red eye, burning like the last coal in a dead fire, surrounded by twisted roots and tatters of leathery white skin hanging off a yellowed skull.\nThe sight of him still frightened Bran\u2014the weirwood roots snaking in and out of his withered flesh, the mushrooms sprouting from his cheeks, the white wooden worm that grew from the socket where one eye had been. He liked it better when the torches were put out. In the dark he could pretend that it was the three-eyed crow who whispered to him and not some grisly talking corpse.\nOne day I will be like him. The thought filled Bran with dread. Bad enough that he was broken, with his useless legs. Was he doomed to lose the rest too, to spend all of his years with a weirwood growing in him and through him? Lord Brynden drew his life from the tree, Leaf told them. He did not eat, he did not drink. He slept, he dreamed, he watched. I was going to be a knight, Bran remembered. I used to run and climb and fight. It seemed a thousand years ago.\nWhat was he now? Only Bran the broken boy, Brandon of House Stark, prince of a lost kingdom, lord of a burned castle, heir to ruins. He had thought the three-eyed crow would be a sorcerer, a wise old wizard who could fix his legs, but that was some stupid child\u2019s dream, he realized now. I am too old for such fancies, he told himself. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. That was as good as being a knight. Almost as good, anyway.\nThe moon was a black hole in the sky. Outside the cave the world went on. Outside the cave the sun rose and set, the moon turned, the cold winds howled. Under the hill, Jojen Reed grew ever more sullen and solitary, to his sister\u2019s distress. She would often sit with Bran beside their little fire, talking of everything and nothing, petting Summer where he slept between them, whilst her brother wandered the caverns by himself. Jojen had even taken to climbing up to the cave\u2019s mouth when the day was bright. He would stand there for hours, looking out over the forest, wrapped in furs yet shivering all the same.\n\u201cHe wants to go home,\u201d Meera told Bran. \u201cHe will not even try and fight his fate. He says the greendreams do not lie.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s being brave,\u201d said Bran. The only time a man can be brave is when he is afraid, his father had told him once, long ago, on the day they found the direwolf pups in the summer snows. He still remembered.\n\u201cHe\u2019s being stupid,\u201d Meera said. \u201cI\u2019d hoped that when we found your three-eyed crow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0now I wonder why we ever came.\u201d\nFor me, Bran thought. \u201cHis greendreams,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHis greendreams.\u201d Meera\u2019s voice was bitter.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor.\nMeera began to cry.\nBran hated being crippled then. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he said. He wanted to put his arms around her, hold her tight the way his mother used to hold him back at Winterfell when he\u2019d hurt himself. She was right there, only a few feet from him, but so far out of reach it might have been a hundred leagues. To touch her he would need to pull himself along the ground with his hands, dragging his legs behind him. The floor was rough and uneven, and it would be slow going, full of scrapes and bumps. I could put on Hodor\u2019s skin, he thought. Hodor could hold her and pat her on the back. The thought made Bran feel strange, but he was still thinking it when Meera bolted from the fire, back out into the darkness of the tunnels. He heard her steps recede until there was nothing but the voices of the singers.\nThe moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. The days marched past, one after the other, each shorter than the one before. The nights grew longer. No sunlight ever reached the caves beneath the hill. No moonlight ever touched those stony halls. Even the stars were strangers there. Those things belonged to the world above, where time ran in its iron circles, day to night to day to night to day.\n\u201cIt is time,\u201d Lord Brynden said.\nSomething in his voice sent icy fingers running up Bran\u2019s back. \u201cTime for what?\u201d\n\u201cFor the next step. For you to go beyond skinchanging and learn what it means to be a greenseer.\u201d\n\u201cThe trees will teach him,\u201d said Leaf. She beckoned, and another of the singers padded forward, the white-haired one that Meera had named Snowylocks. She had a weirwood bowl in her hands, carved with a dozen faces, like the ones the heart trees wore. Inside was a white paste, thick and heavy, with dark red veins running through it. \u201cYou must eat of this,\u201d said Leaf. She handed Bran a wooden spoon.\nThe boy looked at the bowl uncertainly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cA paste of weirwood seeds.\u201d\nSomething about the look of it made Bran feel ill. The red veins were only weirwood sap, he supposed, but in the torchlight they looked remarkably like blood. He dipped the spoon into the paste, then hesitated. \u201cWill this make me a greenseer?\u201d\n\u201cYour blood makes you a greenseer,\u201d said Lord Brynden. \u201cThis will help awaken your gifts and wed you to the trees.\u201d\nBran did want to be married to a tree\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but who else would wed a broken boy like him? A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. A greenseer.\nHe ate.\nIt had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him. The empty bowl slipped from his fingers and clattered on the cavern floor. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any different. What happens next?\u201d\nLeaf touched his hand. \u201cThe trees will teach you. The trees remember.\u201d He raised a hand, and the other singers began to move about the cavern, extinguishing the torches one by one. The darkness thickened and crept toward them.\n\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d said the three-eyed crow. \u201cSlip your skin, as you do when you join with Summer. But this time, go into the roots instead. Follow them up through the earth, to the trees upon the hill, and tell me what you see.\u201d\nBran closed his eyes and slipped free of his skin. Into the roots, he thought. Into the weirwood. Become the tree. For an instant he could see the cavern in its black mantle, could hear the river rushing by below.\nThen all at once he was back home again.\nLord Eddard Stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the godswood, the pale roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man\u2019s gnarled arms. The greatsword Ice lay across Lord Eddard\u2019s lap, and he was cleaning the blade with an oilcloth.\n\u201cWinterfell,\u201d Bran whispered.\nHis father looked up. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he asked, turning\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and Bran, frightened, pulled away. His father and the black pool and the godswood faded and were gone and he was back in the cavern, the pale thick roots of his weirwood throne cradling his limbs as a mother does a child. A torch flared to life before him.\n\u201cTell us what you saw.\u201d From far away Leaf looked almost a girl, no older than Bran or one of his sisters, but close at hand she seemed far older. She claimed to have seen two hundred years.\nBran\u2019s throat was very dry. He swallowed. \u201cWinterfell. I was back in Winterfell. I saw my father. He\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s not, I saw him, he\u2019s back at Winterfell, he\u2019s still alive.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Leaf. \u201cHe is gone, boy. Do not seek to call him back from death.\u201d\n\u201cI saw him.\u201d Bran could feel rough wood pressing against one cheek. \u201cHe was cleaning Ice.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw what you wished to see. Your heart yearns for your father and your home, so that is what you saw.\u201d\n\u201cA man must know how to look before he can hope to see,\u201d said Lord Brynden. \u201cThose were shadows of days past that you saw, Bran. You were looking through the eyes of the heart tree in your godswood. Time is different for a tree than for a man. Sun and soil and water, these are the things a weirwood understands, not days and years and centuries. For men, time is a river. We are trapped in its flow, hurtling from past to present, always in the same direction. The lives of trees are different. They root and grow and die in one place, and that river does not move them. The oak is the acorn, the acorn is the oak. And the weirwood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a thousand human years are a moment to a weirwood, and through such gates you and I may gaze into the past.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Bran, \u201che heard me.\u201d\n\u201cHe heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. I have my own ghosts, Bran. A brother that I loved, a brother that I hated, a woman I desired. Through the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change it.\u201d\n\u201cWill I see my father again?\u201d\n\u201cOnce you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past. Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth\u2019s wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood. The singers carved eyes into their heart trees to awaken them, and those are the first eyes a new greenseer learns to use\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Bran wanted to know.\n\u201cIn a year, or three, or ten. That I have not glimpsed. It will come in time, I promise you. But I am tired now, and the trees are calling me. We will resume on the morrow.\u201d\nHodor carried Bran back to his chamber, muttering \u201cHodor\u201d in a low voice as Leaf went before them with a torch. He had hoped that Meera and Jojen would be there, so he could tell them what he had seen, but their snug alcove in the rock was cold and empty. Hodor eased Bran down onto his bed, covered him with furs, and made a fire for them. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees.\nWatching the flames, Bran decided he would stay awake till Meera came back. Jojen would be unhappy, he knew, but Meera would be glad for him, He did not remember closing his eyes.\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but then somehow he was back at Winterfell again, in the godswood looking down upon his father. Lord Eddard seemed much younger this time. His hair was brown, with no hint of grey in it, his head bowed. \u201c\u2026\u00a0let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them,\u201d he prayed, \u201cand let my lady wife find it in her heart to forgive\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFather.\u201d Bran\u2019s voice was a whisper in the wind, a rustle in the leaves. \u201cFather, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Bran. Brandon.\u201d\nEddard Stark lifted his head and looked long at the weirwood, frowning, but he did not speak. He cannot see me, Bran realized, despairing. He wanted to reach out and touch him, but all that he could do was watch and listen. I am in the tree. I am inside the heart tree, looking out of its red eyes, but the weirwood cannot talk, so I can\u2019t.\nEddard Stark resumed his prayer. Bran felt his eyes fill up with tears. But were they his own tears, or the weirwood\u2019s? If I cry, will the tree begin to weep?\nThe rest of his father\u2019s words were drowned out by a sudden clatter of wood on wood. Eddard Stark dissolved, like mist in a morning sun. Now two children danced across the godswood, hooting at one another as they dueled with broken branches. The girl was the older and taller of the two. Arya! Bran thought eagerly, as he watched her leap up onto a rock and cut at the boy. But that couldn\u2019t be right. If the girl was Arya, the boy was Bran himself, and he had never worn his hair so long. And Arya never beat me playing swords, the way that girl is beating him. She slashed the boy across his thigh, so hard that his leg went out from under him and he fell into the pool and began to splash and shout. \u201cYou be quiet, stupid,\u201d the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. \u201cIt\u2019s just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and run tell Father?\u201d She knelt and pulled her brother from the pool, but before she got him out again, the two of them were gone.\nAfter that the glimpses came faster and faster, till Bran was feeling lost and dizzy. He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her. Then there came a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor. A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows. The tree itself was shrinking, growing smaller with each vision, whilst the lesser trees dwindled into saplings and vanished, only to be replaced by other trees that would dwindle and vanish in their turn. And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them.\nThen, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped toward them through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Bran, \u201cno, don\u2019t,\u201d but they could not hear him, no more than his father had. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his throat, and slashed. And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could only watch as the man\u2019s feet drummed against the earth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but as his life flowed out of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood.",

      "content": "JON\nThe sun had broken through near midday, after seven days of dark skies and snow flurries. Some of the drifts were higher than a man, but the stewards had been shoveling all day and the paths were as clean as they were like to get. Reflections glimmered off the Wall, every crack and crevice glittering pale blue.\nSeven hundred feet up, Jon Snow stood looking down upon the haunted forest. A north wind swirled through the trees below, sending thin white plumes of snow crystals flying from the highest branches, like icy banners. Elsewise nothing moved. Not a sign of life. That was not entirely reassuring. It was not the living that he feared. Even so\u00a0\u2026\nThe sun is out. The snow has stopped. It may be a moon\u2019s turn before we have another chance as good. It may be a season. \u201cHave Emmett assemble his recruits,\u201d he told Dolorous Edd. \u201cWe\u2019ll want an escort. Ten rangers, armed with dragonglass. I want them ready to leave within the hour.\u201d\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord. And to command?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be me.\u201d\nEdd\u2019s mouth turned down even more than usual. \u201cSome might think it better if the lord commander stayed safe and warm south of the Wall. Not that I\u2019d say such myself, but some might.\u201d\nJon smiled. \u201cSome had best not say so in my presence.\u201d\nA sudden gust of wind set Edd\u2019s cloak to flapping noisily. \u201cBest go down, m\u2019lord. This wind\u2019s like to push us off the Wall, and I never did learn the knack of flying.\u201d\nThey rode the winch lift back to the ground. The wind was gusting, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan had told when Jon was a boy. The heavy cage was swaying. From time to time it scraped against the Wall, starting small crystalline showers of ice that sparkled in the sunlight as they fell, like shards of broken glass.\nGlass, Jon mused, might be of use here. Castle Black needs its own glass gardens, like the ones at Winterfell. We could grow vegetables even in the deep of winter. The best glass came from Myr, but a good clear pane was worth its weight in spice, and green and yellow glass would not work as well. What we need is gold. With enough coin, we could buy \u2018prentice glassblowers and glaziers in Myr, bring them north, offer them their freedom for teaching their art to some of our recruits. That would be the way to go about it. If we had the gold. Which we do not.\nAt the base of the Wall he found Ghost rolling in a snowbank. The big white direwolf seemed to love fresh snow. When he saw Jon he bounded back onto his feet and shook himself off. Dolorous Edd said, \u201cHe\u2019s going with you?\u201d\n\u201cHe is.\u201d\n\u201cA clever wolf, him. And me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cA clever lord, you. Ghost\u2019s the better choice. I don\u2019t have the teeth for biting wildlings anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIf the gods are good, we won\u2019t encounter any wildlings. I\u2019ll want the grey gelding.\u201d\nWord spread fast at Castle Black. Edd was still saddling the grey when Bowen Marsh stomped across the yard to confront Jon at the stables. \u201cMy lord, I wish you would reconsider. The new men can take their vows in the sept as easily.\u201d\n\u201cThe sept is home to the new gods. The old gods live in the wood, and those who honor them say their words amongst the weirwoods. You know that as well as I.\u201d\n\u201cSatin comes from Oldtown, and Arron and Emrick from the westerlands. The old gods are not their gods.\u201d\n\u201cI do not tell men which god to worship. They were free to choose the Seven or the red woman\u2019s Lord of Light. They chose the trees instead, with all the peril that entails.\u201d\n\u201cThe Weeping Man may still be out there, watching.\u201d\n\u201cThe grove is no more than two hours\u2019 ride, even with the snow. We should be back by midnight.\u201d\n\u201cToo long. This is not wise.\u201d\n\u201cUnwise,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut necessary. These men are about to pledge their lives to the Night\u2019s Watch, joining a brotherhood that stretches back in an unbroken line for thousands of years. The words matter, and so do these traditions. They bind us all together, highborn and low, young and old, base and noble. They make us brothers.\u201d He clapped Marsh on his shoulder. \u201cI promise you, we shall return.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lord,\u201d said the Lord Steward, \u201cbut will it be as living men or heads on spears with your eyes scooped out? You will be returning through the black of night. The snowdrifts are waist deep in places. I see that you are taking seasoned men with you, that is good, but Black Jack Bulwer knew these woods as well. Even Benjen Stark, your own uncle, he\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have something they did not.\u201d Jon turned his head and whistled. \u201cGhost. To me.\u201d The direwolf shook the snow from his back and trotted to Jon\u2019s side. The rangers parted to let him through, though one mare whinnied and shied away till Rory gave her reins a sharp tug. \u201cThe Wall is yours, Lord Bowen.\u201d He took his horse by the bridle and walked him to the gate and the icy tunnel that snaked beneath the Wall.\nBeyond the ice, the trees stood tall and silent, huddled in the thick white cloaks. Ghost stalked beside Jon\u2019s horse as the rangers and recruits formed up, then stopped and sniffed, his breath frosting in the air. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jon asked. \u201cIs someone there?\u201d The woods were empty as far as he could see, but that was not very far.\nGhost bounded toward the trees, slipped between two white-cloaked pines, and vanished in a cloud of snow. He wants to hunt, but what? Jon did not fear for the direwolf so much as for any wildlings he might encounter. A white wolf in a white wood, silent as a shadow. They will never know he\u2019s coming. He knew better than to go chasing him. Ghost would return when he wanted to and not before. Jon put his heels into his horse. His men fell in around them, the hooves of their garrons breaking through the icy crust to the softer snow beneath. Into the woods they went, at a steady walking pace, as the Wall dwindled behind them.\nThe soldier pines and sentinels wore thick white coats, and icicles draped the bare brown limbs of the broadleafs. Jon sent Tom Barleycorn ahead to scout for them, though the way to the white grove was oft trod and familiar. Big Liddle and Luke of Longtown slipped into the brush to east and west. They would flank the column to give warning of any approach. All were seasoned rangers, armed with obsidian as well as steel, warhorns slung across their saddles should they need to summon help.\nThe others were good men too. Good men in a fight, at least, and loyal to their brothers. Jon could not speak for what they might have been before they reached the Wall, but he did not doubt that most had pasts as black as their cloaks. Up here, they were the sort of men he wanted at his back. Their hoods were raised against the biting wind, and some had scarves wrapped about their faces, hiding their features. Jon knew them, though. Every name was graven on his heart. They were his men, his brothers.\nSix more rode with them\u2014a mix of young and old, large and small, seasoned and raw. Six to say the words. Horse had been born and raised in Mole\u2019s Town, Arron and Emrick came from Fair Isle, Satin from the brothels of Oldtown at the other end of Westeros. All of them were boys. Leathers and Jax were older men, well past forty, sons of the haunted forest, with sons and grandsons of their own. They had been two of the sixty-three wildlings who had followed Jon Snow back to the Wall the day he made his appeal, so far the only two to decide they wanted a black cloak. Iron Emmett said they all were ready, or as ready as they were ever going to be. He and Jon and Bowen Marsh had weighed each man in turn and assigned him to an order: Leathers, Jax, and Emrick to the rangers, Horse to the builders, Arron and Satin to the stewards. The time had come for them to take their vows.\nIron Emmett rode at the head of the column, mounted on the ugliest horse Jon had ever seen, a shaggy beast that looked to be all hair and hooves. \u201cTalk is there was some trouble at Harlot\u2019s Tower last night,\u201d the master-at-arms said.\n\u201cHardin\u2019s Tower.\u201d Of the sixty-three who had come back with him from Mole\u2019s Town, nineteen had been women and girls. Jon had housed them in the same abandoned tower where he had once slept when he had been new to the Wall. Twelve were spearwives, more than capable of defending both themselves and the younger girls from the unwanted attentions of black brothers. It was some of the men they\u2019d turned away who\u2019d given Hardin\u2019s Tower its new, inflammatory name. Jon was not about to condone the mockery. \u201cThree drunken fools mistook Hardin\u2019s for a brothel, that\u2019s all. They are in the ice cells now, contemplating their mistake.\u201d\nIron Emmett grimaced. \u201cMen are men, vows are words, and words are wind. You should put guards around the women.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who will guard the guards?\u201d You know nothing, Jon Snow. He had learned, though, and Ygritte had been his teacher. If he could not hold to his own vows, how could he expect more of his brothers? But there were dangers in trifling with wildling women. A man can own a woman, and a man can own a knife, Ygritte had told him once, but no man can own both. Bowen Marsh had not been all wrong. Hardin\u2019s Tower was tinder waiting for a spark. \u201cI mean to open three more castles,\u201d Jon said. \u201cDeep Lake, Sable Hall, and the Long Barrow. All garrisoned with free folk, under the command of our own officers. The Long Barrow will be all women, aside from the commander and chief steward.\u201d There would be some mingling, he did not doubt, but the distances were great enough to make that difficult, at least.\n\u201cAnd what poor fool will get that choice command?\u201d\n\u201cI am riding beside him.\u201d\nThe look of mingled horror and delight that passed across Iron Emmett\u2019s face was worth more than a sack of gold. \u201cWhat have I done to make you hate me so, my lord?\u201d\nJon laughed. \u201cHave no fear, you won\u2019t be alone. I mean to give you Dolorous Edd as your second and your steward.\u201d\n\u201cThe spearwives will be so happy. You might do well to bestow a castle on the Magnar.\u201d\nJon\u2019s smile died. \u201cI might if I could trust him. Sigorn blames me for his father\u2019s death, I fear. Worse, he was bred and trained to give orders, not to take them. Do not confuse the Thenns with free folk. Magnar means lord in the Old Tongue, I am told, but Styr was closer to a god to his people, and his son is cut from the same skin. I do not require men to kneel, but they do need to obey.\u201d\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord, but you had best do something with the Magnar. You\u2019ll have trouble with the Thenns if you ignore them.\u201d\nTrouble is the lord commander\u2019s lot, Jon might have said. His visit to Mole\u2019s Town was giving him plenty, as it happened, and the women were the least of it. Halleck was proving to be just as truculent as he had feared, and there were some amongst the black brothers whose hatred of the free folk was bone deep. One of Halleck\u2019s followers had already cut off a builder\u2019s ear in the yard, and like as not that was just a taste of the bloodshed to come. He had to get the old forts open soon, so Harma\u2019s brother could be sent off to garrison Deep Lake or Sable Hall. Just now, though, neither of those was fit for human habitation, and Othell Yarwyck and his builders were still off trying to restore the Nightfort. There were nights when Jon Snow wondered if he had not made a grievous mistake by preventing Stannis from marching all the wildlings off to be slaughtered. I know nothing, Ygritte, he thought, and perhaps I never will.\nHalf a mile from the grove, long red shafts of autumn sunlight were slanting down between the branches of the leafless trees, staining the snowdrifts pink. The riders crossed a frozen stream, between two jagged rocks armored in ice, then followed a twisting game trail to the northeast. Whenever the wind kicked up, sprays of loose snow filled the air and stung their eyes. Jon pulled his scarf up over his mouth and nose and raised the hood on his cloak. \u201cNot far now,\u201d he told the men. No one replied.\nJon smelled Tom Barleycorn before he saw him. Or was it Ghost who smelled him? Of late, Jon Snow sometimes felt as if he and the direwolf were one, even awake. The great white wolf appeared first, shaking off the snow. A few moments later Tom was there. \u201cWildlings,\u201d he told Jon, softly. \u201cIn the grove.\u201d\nJon brought the riders to a halt. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cI counted nine. No guards. Some dead, might be, or sleeping. Most look to be women. One child, but there\u2019s a giant too. Just the one that I saw. They got a fire burning, smoke drifting through the trees. Fools.\u201d\nNine, and I have seven-and-ten. Four of his were green boys, though, and none were giants.\nJon was not of a mind to fall back to the Wall, however. If the wildlings are still alive, it may be we can bring them in. And if they are dead, well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a corpse or two could be of use. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue on foot,\u201d he said, dropping lightly to the frozen ground. The snow was ankle deep. \u201cRory, Pate, stay with the horses.\u201d He might have given that duty to the recruits, but they would need to be blooded soon enough. This was as good a time as any. \u201cSpread out and form a crescent. I want to close in on the grove from three sides. Keep the men to your right and left in sight, so the gaps do not widen. The snow should muffle our steps. Less chance of blood if we take them unawares.\u201d\nNight was falling fast. The shafts of sunlight had vanished when the last thin slice of the sun was swallowed beneath the western woods. The pink snow drifts were going white again, the color leaching out of them as the world darkened. The evening sky had turned the faded grey of an old cloak that had been washed too many times, and the first shy stars were coming out.\nAhead he glimpsed a pale white trunk that could only be a weirwood, crowned with a head of dark red leaves. Jon Snow reached back and pulled Longclaw from his sheath. He looked to right and left, gave Satin and Horse a nod, watched them pass it on to the men beyond. They rushed the grove together, kicking through drifts of old snow with no sound but their breathing. Ghost ran with them, a white shadow at Jon\u2019s side.\nThe weirwoods rose in a circle around the edges of the clearing. There were nine, all roughly of the same age and size. Each one had a face carved into it, and no two faces were alike. Some were smiling, some were screaming, some were shouting at him. In the deepening glow their eyes looked black, but in daylight they would be blood-red, Jon knew. Eyes like Ghost\u2019s.\nThe fire in the center of the grove was a small sad thing, ashes and embers and a few broken branches burning slow and smoky. Even then, it had more life than the wildlings huddled near it. Only one of them reacted when Jon stepped from the brush. That was the child, who began to wail, clutching at his mother\u2019s ragged cloak. The woman raised her eyes and gasped. By then the grove was ringed by rangers, sliding past the bone-white trees, steel glinting in black-gloved hands, poised for slaughter.\nThe giant was the last to notice them. He had been asleep, curled up by the fire, but something woke him\u2014the child\u2019s cry, the sound of snow crunching beneath black boots, a sudden indrawn breath. When he stirred it was as if a boulder had come to life. He heaved himself into a sitting position with a snort, pawing at his eyes with hands as big as hams to rub the sleep away\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until he saw Iron Emmett, his sword shining in his hand. Roaring, he came leaping to his feet, and one of those huge hands closed around a maul and jerked it up.\nGhost showed his teeth in answer. Jon grabbed the wolf by the scruff of the neck. \u201cWe want no battle here.\u201d His men could bring the giant down, he knew, but not without cost. Once blood was shed, the wildlings would join the fray. Most or all would die here, and some of his own brothers too. \u201cThis is a holy place. Yield, and we\u2014\u201d\nThe giant bellowed again, a sound that shook the leaves in the trees, and slammed his maul against the ground. The shaft of it was six feet of gnarled oak, the head a stone as big as a loaf of bread. The impact made the ground shake. Some of the other wildlings went scrambling for their own weapons.\nJon Snow was about to reach for Longclaw when Leathers spoke, from the far side of the grove. His words sounded gruff and guttural, but Jon heard the music in it and recognized the Old Tongue. Leathers spoke for a long while. When he was done, the giant answered. It sounded like growling, interspersed with grunts, and Jon could not understand a word of it. But Leathers pointed at the trees and said something else, and the giant pointed at the trees, ground his teeth, and dropped his maul.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d said Leathers. \u201cThey want no fight.\u201d\n\u201cWell done. What did you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cThat they were our gods too. That we came to pray.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall. Put away your steel, all of you. We will have no blood shed here tonight.\u201d\nNine, Tom Barleycorn had said, and nine there were, but two were dead and one so weak he might have died by morning. The six who remained included a mother and child, two old men, a wounded Thenn in battered bronze, and one of the Hornfoot folk, his bare feet so badly frostbitten that Jon knew at a glance he would never walk again. Most had been strangers to one another when they came to the grove, he learned subsequently; when Stannis broke Mance Rayder\u2019s host, they had fled into the woods to escape the carnage, wandered for a time, lost friends and kin to cold and starvation, and finally washed up here, too weak and weary to go on. \u201cThe gods are here,\u201d one of the old men said. \u201cThis was as good a place to die as any.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall is only a few hours south of here,\u201d said Jon. \u201cWhy not seek shelter there? Others yielded. Even Mance.\u201d\nThe wildlings exchanged looks. Finally one said, \u201cWe heard stories. The crows burned all them that yielded.\u201d\n\u201cEven Mance hisself,\u201d the woman added.\nMelisandre, Jon thought, you and your red god have much and more to answer for. \u201cAll those who wish are welcome to return with us. There is food and shelter at Castle Black, and the Wall to keep you safe from the things that haunt these woods. You have my word, no one will burn.\u201d\n\u201cA crow\u2019s word,\u201d the woman said, hugging her child close, \u201cbut who\u2019s to say that you can keep it? Who are you?\u201d\n\u201cLord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, and a son of Eddard Stark of Winterfell.\u201d Jon turned to Tom Barleycorn. \u201cHave Rory and Pate bring up the horses. I do not mean to stay here one moment longer than we must.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nOne last thing remained before they could depart: the thing that they had come for. Iron Emmett called forth his charges, and as the rest of the company watched from a respectful distance, they knelt before the weirwoods. The last light of day was gone by then; the only light came from the stars above and the faint red glow of the dying fire in the center of the grove.\nWith their black hoods and thick black cowls, the six might have been carved from shadow. Their voices rose together, small against the vastness of the night. \u201cNight gathers, and now my watch begins,\u201d they said, as thousands had said before them. Satin\u2019s voice was sweet as song, Horse\u2019s hoarse and halting, Arron\u2019s a nervous squeak. \u201cIt shall not end until my death.\u201d\nMay those deaths be long in coming. Jon Snow sank to one knee in the snow. Gods of my fathers, protect these men. And Arya too, my little sister, wherever she might be. I pray you, let Mance find her and bring her safe to me.\n\u201cI shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children,\u201d the recruits promised, in voices that echoed back through years and centuries. \u201cI shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post.\u201d\nGods of the wood, grant me the strength to do the same, Jon Snow prayed silently. Give me the wisdom to know what must be done and the courage to do it.\n\u201cI am the sword in the darkness,\u201d said the six, and it seemed to Jon as though their voices were changing, growing stronger, more certain. \u201cI am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.\u201d\nThe shield that guards the realms of men. Ghost nuzzled up against his shoulder, and Jon draped an arm around him. He could smell Horse\u2019s unwashed breeches, the sweet scent Satin combed into his beard, the rank sharp smell of fear, the giant\u2019s overpowering musk. He could hear the beating of his own heart. When he looked across the grove at the woman with her child, the two greybeards, the Hornfoot man with his maimed feet, all he saw was men.\n\u201cI pledge my life and honor to the Night\u2019s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.\u201d\nJon Snow was the first onto his feet. \u201cRise now as men of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d He gave Horse a hand to pull him up.\nThe wind was rising. It was time to go.\nThe journey back took much longer than the journey to the grove. The giant\u2019s pace was a ponderous one, despite the length and girth of those legs, and he was forever stopping to knock snow off low-hanging limbs with his maul. The woman rode double with Rory, her son with Tom Barleycorn, the old men with Horse and Satin. The Thenn was frightened of the horses, however, and preferred to limp along despite his wounds. The Hornfoot man could not sit a saddle and had to be tied over the back of a garron like a sack of grain; so too the pale-faced crone with the stick-thin limbs, whom they had not been able to rouse.\nThey did the same with the two corpses, to the puzzlement of Iron Emmett. \u201cThey will only slow us, my lord,\u201d he said to Jon. \u201cWe should chop them up and burn them.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jon. \u201cBring them. I have a use for them.\u201d\nThey had no moon to guide them home, and only now and then a patch of stars. The world was black and white and still. It was a long, slow, endless trek. The snow clung to their boots and breeches, and the wind rattled the pines and made their cloaks snap and swirl. Jon glimpsed the red wanderer above, watching them through the leafless branches of great trees as they made their way beneath. The Thief, the free folk called it. The best time to steal a woman was when the Thief was in the Moonmaid, Ygritte had always claimed. She never mentioned the best time to steal a giant. Or two dead men.\nIt was almost dawn before they saw the Wall again.\nA sentry\u2019s horn greeted them as they approached, sounding from on high like the cry of some huge, deep-throated bird, a single long blast that meant rangers returning. Big Liddle unslung his own warhorn and gave answer. At the gate, they had to wait a few moments before Dolorous Edd Tollett appeared to slide back the bolts and swing open the iron bars. When Edd caught sight of the ragged band of wildlings, he pursed his lips and gave the giant a long look. \u201cMight need some butter to slide that one through the tunnel, m\u2019lord. Shall I send someone to the larder?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think he\u2019ll fit. Unbuttered.\u201d\nSo he did\u00a0\u2026\u00a0on hands and knees, crawling. A big boy, this one. Fourteen feet, at least. Even bigger than Mag the Mighty. Mag had died beneath this very ice, locked in mortal struggle with Donal Noye. A good man. The Watch has lost too many good men. Jon took Leathers aside. \u201cTake charge of him. You speak his tongue. See that he is fed and find him a warm place by the fire. Stay with him. See that no one provokes him.\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d Leathers hesitated. \u201cM\u2019lord.\u201d\nThe living wildlings Jon sent off to have their wounds and frostbites tended. Some hot food and warm clothes would restore most of them, he hoped, though the Hornfoot man was like to lose both feet. The corpses he consigned to the ice cells.\nClydas had come and gone, Jon noted as he was hanging his cloak on the peg beside the door. A letter had been left on the table in his solar. Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower, he assumed at first glance. But the wax was gold, not black. The seal showed a stag\u2019s head within a flaming heart. Stannis. Jon cracked the hardened wax, flattened the roll of parchment, read. A maester\u2019s hand, but the king\u2019s words.\nStannis had taken Deepwood Motte, and the mountain clans had joined him. Flint, Norrey, Wull, Liddle, all.",

      "content": "The moment Jon set the letter aside, the parchment curled up again, as if eager to protect its secrets. He was not at all sure how he felt about what he had just read. Battles had been fought at Winterfell before, but never one without a Stark on one side or the other. \u201cThe castle is a shell,\u201d he said, \u201cnot Winterfell, but the ghost of Winterfell.\u201d It was painful just to think of it, much less say the words aloud. And still\u00a0\u2026\nHe wondered how many men old Crowfood would bring to the fray, and how many swords Arnolf Karstark would be able to conjure up. Half the Umbers would be across the field with Whoresbane, fighting beneath the flayed man of the Dreadfort, and the greater part of the strength of both houses had gone south with Robb, never to return. Even ruined, Winterfell itself would confer a considerable advantage on whoever held it. Robert Baratheon would have seen that at once and moved swiftly to secure the castle, with the forced marches and midnight rides for which he had been famous. Would his brother be as bold?\nNot likely. Stannis was a deliberate commander, and his host was a half-digested stew of clansmen, southron knights, king\u2019s men and queen\u2019s men, salted with a few northern lords. He should move on Winterfell swiftly, or not at all, Jon thought. It was not his place to advise the king, but\u00a0\u2026\nHe glanced at the letter again. I will save your sister if I can. A surprisingly tender sentiment from Stannis, though undercut by that final, brutal if I can and the addendum and find a better match for her than Ramsay Snow. But what if Arya was not there to be saved? What if Lady Melisandre\u2019s flames had told it true? Could his sister truly have escaped such captors? How would she do that? Arya was always quick and clever, but in the end she\u2019s just a little girl, and Roose Bolton is not the sort who would be careless with a prize of such great worth.\nWhat if Bolton never had his sister? This wedding could well be just some ruse to lure Stannis into a trap. Eddard Stark had never had any reason to complain of the Lord of the Dreadfort, so far as Jon knew, but even so he had never trusted him, with his whispery voice and his pale, pale eyes.\nA grey girl on a dying horse, fleeing from her marriage. On the strength of those words he had loosed Mance Rayder and six spearwives on the north. \u201cYoung ones, and pretty,\u201d Mance had said. The unburnt king supplied some names, and Dolorous Edd had done the rest, smuggling them from Mole\u2019s Town. It seemed like madness now. He might have done better to strike down Mance the moment he revealed himself. Jon had a certain grudging admiration for the late King-Beyond-the-Wall, but the man was an oathbreaker and a turncloak. He had even less trust in Melisandre. Yet somehow here he was, pinning his hopes on them. All to save my sister. But the men of the Night\u2019s Watch have no sisters.\nWhen Jon had been a boy at Winterfell, his hero had been the Young Dragon, the boy king who had conquered Dorne at the age of fourteen. Despite his bastard birth, or perhaps because of it, Jon Snow had dreamed of leading men to glory just as King Daeron had, of growing up to be a conqueror. Now he was a man grown and the Wall was his, yet all he had were doubts. He could not even seem to conquer those.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe stench of the camp was so appalling it was all that Dany could do not to gag.\nSer Barristan wrinkled up his nose, and said, \u201cYour Grace should not be here, breathing these black humors.\u201d\n\u201cI am the blood of the dragon,\u201d Dany reminded him. \u201cHave you ever seen a dragon with the flux?\u201d Viserys had oft claimed that Targaryens were untroubled by the pestilences that afflicted common men, and so far as she could tell, it was true. She could remember being cold and hungry and afraid, but never sick.\n\u201cEven so,\u201d the old knight said, \u201cI would feel better if Your Grace would return to the city.\u201d The many-colored brick walls of Meereen were half a mile back. \u201cThe bloody flux has been the bane of every army since the Dawn Age. Let us distribute the food, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cOn the morrow. I am here now. I want to see.\u201d She put her heels into her silver. The others trotted after her. Jhogo rode before her, Aggo and Rakharo just behind, long Dothraki whips in hand to keep away the sick and dying. Ser Barristan was at her right, mounted on a dapple grey. To her left was Symon Stripeback of the Free Brothers and Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men. Three score soldiers followed close behind the captains, to protect the food wagons. Mounted men all, Dothraki and Brazen Beasts and freedmen, they were united only by their distaste for this duty.\nThe Astapori stumbled after them in a ghastly procession that grew longer with every yard they crossed. Some spoke tongues she did not understand. Others were beyond speaking. Many lifted their hands to Dany, or knelt as her silver went by. \u201cMother,\u201d they called to her, in the dialects of Astapor, Lys, and Old Volantis, in guttural Dothraki and the liquid syllables of Qarth, even in the Common Tongue of Westeros. \u201cMother, please\u00a0\u2026\u00a0mother, help my sister, she is sick\u00a0\u2026\u00a0give me food for my little ones\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please, my old father\u00a0\u2026\u00a0help him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0help her\u00a0\u2026\u00a0help me\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nI have no more help to give, Dany thought, despairing. The Astapori had no place to go. Thousands remained outside Meereen\u2019s thick walls\u2014men and women and children, old men and little girls and newborn babes. Many were sick, most were starved, and all were doomed to die. Daenerys dare not open her gates to let them in. She had tried to do what she could for them. She had sent them healers, Blue Graces and spell-singers and barber-surgeons, but some of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the galloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating the healthy from the sick had proved impractical as well. Her Stalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from their mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with stones. A few days later, the sick were dead and the healthy ones were sick. Dividing the one from the other had accomplished nothing.\nEven feeding them had grown difficult. Every day she sent them what she could, but every day there were more of them and less food to give them. It was growing harder to find drivers willing to deliver the food as well. Too many of the men they had sent into the camp had been stricken by the flux themselves. Others had been attacked on the way back to the city. Yesterday a wagon had been overturned and two of her soldiers killed, so today the queen had determined that she would bring the food herself. Every one of her advisors had argued fervently against it, from Reznak and the Shavepate to Ser Barristan, but Daenerys would not be moved. \u201cI will not turn away from them,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cA queen must know the sufferings of her people.\u201d\nSuffering was the only thing they did not lack. \u201cThere is scarcely a horse or mule left, though many rode from Astapor,\u201d Marselen reported to her. \u201cThey\u2019ve eaten every one, Your Grace, along with every rat and scavenger dog that they could catch. Now some have begun to eat their own dead.\u201d\n\u201cMan must not eat the flesh of man,\u201d said Aggo.\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d agreed Rahkaro. \u201cThey will be cursed.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re past cursing,\u201d said Symon Stripeback.\nLittle children with swollen stomachs trailed after them, too weak or scared to beg. Gaunt men with sunken eyes squatted amidst sand and stones, shitting out their lives in stinking streams of brown and red. Many shat where they slept now, too feeble to crawl to the ditches she\u2019d commanded them to dig. Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten stood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick lest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength called out. \u201cMother\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please, Mother\u00a0\u2026\u00a0bless you, Mother\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nBless me, Dany thought bitterly. Your city is gone to ash and bone, your people are dying all around you. I have no shelter for you, no medicine, no hope. Only stale bread and wormy meat, hard cheese, a little milk. Bless me, bless me.\nWhat kind of mother has no milk to feed her children?\n\u201cToo many dead,\u201d Aggo said. \u201cThey should be burned.\u201d\n\u201cWho will burn them?\u201d asked Ser Barristan. \u201cThe bloody flux is everywhere. A hundred die each night.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not good to touch the dead,\u201d said Jhogo.\n\u201cThis is known,\u201d Aggo and Rakharo said, together.\n\u201cThat may be so,\u201d said Dany, \u201cbut this thing must be done, all the same.\u201d She thought a moment. \u201cThe Unsullied have no fear of corpses. I shall speak to Grey Worm.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Ser Barristan, \u201cthe Unsullied are your best fighters. We dare not loose this plague amongst them. Let the Astapori bury their own dead.\u201d\n\u201cThey are too feeble,\u201d said Symon Stripeback.\nDany said, \u201cMore food might make them stronger.\u201d\nSymon shook his head. \u201cFood should not be wasted on the dying, Your Worship. We do not have enough to feed the living.\u201d\nHe was not wrong, she knew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear. \u201cThis is far enough,\u201d the queen decided. \u201cWe\u2019ll feed them here.\u201d She raised a hand. Behind her the wagons bumped to a halt, and her riders spread out around them, to keep the Astapori from rushing at the food. No sooner had they stopped than the press began to thicken around them, as more and more of the afflicted came limping and shambling toward the wagons. The riders cut them off. \u201cWait your turn,\u201d they shouted. \u201cNo pushing. Back. Stay back. Bread for everyone. Wait your turn.\u201d\nDany could only sit and watch. \u201cSer,\u201d she said to Barristan Selmy, \u201cis there no more we can do? You have provisions.\u201d\n\u201cProvisions for Your Grace\u2019s soldiers. We may well need to withstand a long siege. The Stormcrows and the Second Sons can harry the Yunkishmen, but they cannot hope to turn them. If Your Grace would allow me to assemble an army\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf there must be a battle, I would sooner fight it from behind the walls of Meereen. Let the Yunkai\u2019i try and storm my battlements.\u201d The queen surveyed the scene around her. \u201cIf we were to share our food equally\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0the Astapori would eat through their portion in days, and we would have that much less for the siege.\u201d\nDany gazed across the camp, to the many-colored brick walls of Meereen. The air was thick with flies and cries. \u201cThe gods have sent this pestilence to humble me. So many dead\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will not have them eating corpses.\u201d She beckoned Aggo closer. \u201cRide to the gates and bring me Grey Worm and fifty of his Unsullied.\u201d\n\u201cKhaleesi. The blood of your blood obeys.\u201d Aggo touched his horse with his heels and galloped off.\nSer Barristan watched with ill-concealed apprehension. \u201cYou should not linger here overlong, Your Grace. The Astapori are being fed, as you commanded. There\u2019s no more we can do for the poor wretches. We should repair back to the city.\u201d\n\u201cGo if you wish, ser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.\u201d Dany vaulted down from the horse. \u201cI cannot heal them, but I can show them that their Mother cares.\u201d\nJhogo sucked in his breath. \u201cKhaleesi, no.\u201d The bell in his braid rang softly as he dismounted. \u201cYou must not get any closer. Do not let them touch you! Do not!\u201d\nDany walked right past him. There was an old man on the ground a few feet away, moaning and staring up at the grey belly of the clouds. She knelt beside him, wrinkling her nose at the smell, and pushed back his dirty grey hair to feel his brow. \u201cHis flesh is on fire. I need water to bathe him. Seawater will serve. Marselen, will you fetch some for me? I need oil as well, for the pyre. Who will help me burn the dead?\u201d\nBy the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the Unsullied loping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping her. Symon Stripeback and his men were pulling the living from the dead and stacking up the corpses, while Jhogo and Rakharo and their Dothraki helped those who could still walk toward the shore to bathe and wash their clothes. Aggo stared at them as if they had all gone mad, but Grey Worm knelt beside the queen and said, \u201cThis one would be of help.\u201d\nBefore midday a dozen fires were burning. Columns of greasy black smoke rose up to stain a merciless blue sky. Dany\u2019s riding clothes were stained and sooty as she stepped back from the pyres. \u201cWorship,\u201d Grey Worm said, \u201cthis one and his brothers beg your leave to bathe in the salt sea when our work here is done, that we might be purified according to the laws of our great goddess.\u201d\nThe queen had not known that the eunuchs had a goddess of their own. \u201cWho is this goddess? One of the gods of Ghis?\u201d\nGrey Worm looked troubled. \u201cThe goddess is called by many names. She is the Lady of Spears, the Bride of Battle, the Mother of Hosts, but her true name belongs only to these poor ones who have burned their manhoods upon her altar. We may not speak of her to others. This one begs your forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish. Yes, you may bathe if that is your desire. Thank you for your help.\u201d\n\u201cThese ones live to serve you.\u201d\nWhen Daenerys returned to her pyramid, sore of limb and sick of heart, she found Missandei reading some old scroll whilst Irri and Jhiqui argued about Rakharo. \u201cYou are too skinny for him,\u201d Jhiqui was saying. \u201cYou are almost a boy. Rakharo does not bed with boys. This is known.\u201d Irri bristled back. \u201cIt is known that you are almost a cow. Rakharo does not bed with cows.\u201d\n\u201cRakharo is blood of my blood. His life belongs to me, not you,\u201d Dany told the two of them. Rakharo had grown almost half a foot during his time away from Meereen and returned with arms and legs thick with muscle and four bells in his hair. He towered over Aggo and Jhogo now, as her handmaids had both noticed. \u201cNow be quiet. I need to bathe.\u201d She had never felt more soiled. \u201cJhiqui, help me from these clothes, then take them away and burn them. Irri, tell Qezza to find me something light and cool to wear. The day was very hot.\u201d\nA cool wind was blowing on her terrace. Dany sighed with pleasure as she slipped into the waters of her pool. At her command, Missandei stripped off her clothes and climbed in after her. \u201cThis one heard the Astapori scratching at the walls last night,\u201d the little scribe said as she was washing Dany\u2019s back.\nIrri and Jhiqui exchanged a look. \u201cNo one was scratching,\u201d said Jhiqui. \u201cScratching\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how could they scratch?\u201d\n\u201cWith their hands,\u201d said Missandei. \u201cThe bricks are old and crumbling. They are trying to claw their way into the city.\u201d\n\u201cThis would take them many years,\u201d said Irri. \u201cThe walls are very thick. This is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d agreed Jhiqui.\n\u201cI dream of them as well.\u201d Dany took Missandei\u2019s hand. \u201cThe camp is a good half-mile from the city, my sweetling. No one was scratching at the walls.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace knows best,\u201d said Missandei. \u201cShall I wash your hair? It is almost time. Reznak mo Reznak and the Green Grace are coming to discuss\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014the wedding preparations.\u201d Dany sat up with a splash. \u201cI had almost forgotten.\u201d Perhaps I wanted to forget. \u201cAnd after them, I am to dine with Hizdahr.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIrri, bring the green tokar, the silk one fringed with Myrish lace.\u201d\n\u201cThat one is being repaired, Khaleesi. The lace was torn. The blue tokar has been cleaned.\u201d\n\u201cBlue, then. They will be just as pleased.\u201d\nShe was only half-wrong. The priestess and the seneschal were happy to see her garbed in a tokar, a proper Meereenese lady for once, but what they really wanted was to strip her bare. Daenerys heard them out, incredulous. When they were done, she said, \u201cI have no wish to give offense, but I will not present myself naked to Hizdahr\u2019s mother and sisters.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Reznak mo Reznak, blinking, \u201cbut you must, Your Worship. Before a marriage it is traditional for the women of the man\u2019s house to examine the bride\u2019s womb and, ah\u00a0\u2026\u00a0her female parts. To ascertain that they are well formed and, ah\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0fertile,\u201d finished Galazza Galare. \u201cAn ancient ritual, Your Radiance. Three Graces shall be present to witness the examination and say the proper prayers.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Reznak, \u201cand afterward there is a special cake. A women\u2019s cake, baked only for betrothals. Men are not allowed to taste it. I am told it is delicious. Magical.\u201d\nAnd if my womb is withered and my female parts accursed, is there a special cake for that as well? \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq may inspect my women\u2019s parts after we are wed.\u201d Khal Drogo found no fault with them, why should he? \u201cLet his mother and his sisters examine one another and share the special cake. I shall not be eating it. Nor shall I wash the noble Hizdahr\u2019s noble feet.\u201d\n\u201cMagnificence, you do not understand,\u201d protested Reznak. \u201cThe washing of the feet is hallowed by tradition. It signifies that you shall be your husband\u2019s handmaid. The wedding garb is fraught with meaning too. The bride is dressed in dark red veils above a tokar of white silk, fringed with baby pearls.\u201d\nThe queen of the rabbits must not be wed without her floppy ears. \u201cAll those pearls will make me rattle when I walk.\u201d\n\u201cThe pearls symbolize fertility. The more pearls Your Worship wears, the more healthy children she will bear.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I want a hundred children?\u201d Dany turned to the Green Grace. \u201cIf we should wed by Westerosi rites\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe gods of Ghis would deem it no true union.\u201d Galazza Galare\u2019s face was hidden behind a veil of green silk. Only her eyes showed, green and wise and sad. \u201cIn the eyes of the city you would be the noble Hizdahr\u2019s concubine, not his lawful wedded wife. Your children would be bastards. Your Worship must marry Hizdahr in the Temple of the Graces, with all the nobility of Meereen on hand to bear witness to your union.\u201d\nGet the heads of all the noble houses out of their pyramids on some pretext, Daario had said. The dragon\u2019s words are fire and blood. Dany pushed the thought aside. It was not worthy of her. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI shall marry Hizdahr in the Temple of the Graces wrapped in a white tokar fringed with baby pearls. Is there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cOne more small matter, Your Worship,\u201d said Reznak. \u201cTo celebrate your nuptials, it would be most fitting if you would allow the fighting pits to open once again. It would be your wedding gift to Hizdahr and to your loving people, a sign that you had embraced the ancient ways and customs of Meereen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd most pleasing to the gods as well,\u201d the Green Grace added in her soft and kindly voice.\nA bride price paid in blood. Daenerys was weary of fighting this battle. Even Ser Barristan did not think she could win. \u201cNo ruler can make a people good,\u201d Selmy had told her. \u201cBaelor the Blessed prayed and fasted and built the Seven as splendid a temple as any gods could wish for, yet he could not put an end to war and want.\u201d A queen must listen to her people, Dany reminded herself. \u201cAfter the wedding Hizdahr will be king. Let him reopen the fighting pits if he wishes. I want no part of it.\u201d Let the blood be on his hands, not mine. She rose. \u201cIf my husband wishes me to wash his feet, he must first wash mine. I will tell him so this evening.\u201d She wondered how her betrothed would take that.\nShe need not have been concerned. Hizdahr zo Loraq arrived an hour after the sun had set. His own tokar was burgundy, with a golden stripe and a fringe of golden beads. Dany told him of her meeting with Reznak and the Green Grace as she was pouring wine for him. \u201cThese rituals are empty,\u201d Hizdahr declared, \u201cjust the sort of thing we must sweep aside. Meereen has been steeped in these foolish old traditions for too long.\u201d He kissed her hand and said, \u201cDaenerys, my queen, I will gladly wash you from head to heel if that is what I must do to be your king and consort.\u201d\n\u201cTo be my king and consort, you need only bring me peace. Skahaz tells me you have had messages of late.\u201d\n\u201cI have.\u201d Hizdahr crossed his long legs. He looked pleased with himself. \u201cYunkai will give us peace, but for a price. The disruption of the slave trade has caused great injury throughout the civilized world. Yunkai and her allies will require an indemnity of us, to be paid in gold and gemstones.\u201d\nGold and gems were easy. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i will resume slaving, as before. Astapor will be rebuilt, as a slave city. You will not interfere.\u201d\n\u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i resumed their slaving before I was two leagues from their city. Did I turn back? King Cleon begged me to join with him against them, and I turned a deaf ear to his pleas. I want no war with Yunkai. How many times must I say it? What promises do they require?\u201d\n\u201cAh, there is the thorn in the bower, my queen,\u201d said Hizdahr zo Loraq. \u201cSad to say, Yunkai has no faith in your promises. They keep plucking the same string on the harp, about some envoy that your dragons set on fire.\u201d\n\u201cOnly his tokar was burned,\u201d said Dany scornfully.\n\u201cBe that as it may, they do not trust you. The men of New Ghis feel the same. Words are wind, as you yourself have so oft said. No words of yours will secure this peace for Meereen. Your foes require deeds. They would see us wed, and they would see me crowned as king, to rule beside you.\u201d\nDany filled his wine cup again, wanting nothing so much as to pour the flagon over his head and drown his complacent smile. \u201cMarriage or carnage. A wedding or a war. Are those my choices?\u201d\n\u201cI see only one choice, Your Radiance. Let us say our vows before the gods of Ghis and make a new Meereen together.\u201d\nThe queen was framing her response when she heard a step behind her. The food, she thought. Her cooks had promised her to serve the noble Hizdahr\u2019s favorite meal, dog in honey, stuffed with prunes and peppers. But when she turned to look, it was Ser Barristan standing there, freshly bathed and clad in white, his longsword at his side. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, bowing, \u201cI am sorry to disturb you, but I thought that you would want to know at once. The Stormcrows have returned to the city, with word of the foe. The Yunkishmen are on the march, just as we had feared.\u201d\nA flicker of annoyance crossed the noble face of Hizdahr zo Loraq. \u201cThe queen is at her supper. These sellswords can wait.\u201d\nSer Barristan ignored him. \u201cI asked Lord Daario to make his report to me, as Your Grace had commanded. He laughed and said that he would write it out in his own blood if Your Grace would send your little scribe to show him how to make the letters.\u201d\n\u201cBlood?\u201d said Dany, horrified. \u201cIs that a jape? No. No, don\u2019t tell me, I must see him for myself.\u201d She was a young girl, and alone, and young girls can change their minds. \u201cConvene my captains and commanders. Hizdahr, I know you will forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cMeereen must come first.\u201d Hizdahr smiled genially. \u201cWe will have other nights. A thousand nights.\u201d\n\u201cSer Barristan will show you out.\u201d Dany hurried off, calling for her handmaids. She would not welcome her captain home in a tokar. In the end she tried a dozen gowns before she found one she liked, but she refused the crown that Jhiqui offered her.\nAs Daario Naharis took a knee before her, Dany\u2019s heart gave a lurch. His hair was matted with dried blood, and on his temple a deep cut glistened red and raw. His right sleeve was bloody almost to the elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she gasped.\n\u201cThis?\u201d Daario touched his temple. \u201cA crossbowman tried to put a quarrel through my eye, but I outrode it. I was hurrying home to my queen, to bask in the warmth of her smile.\u201d He shook his sleeve, spattering red droplets. \u201cThis blood is not mine. One of my serjeants said we should go over to the Yunkai\u2019i, so I reached down his throat and pulled his heart out. I meant to bring it to you as a gift for my silver queen, but four of the Cats cut me off and came snarling and spitting after me. One almost caught me, so I threw the heart into his face.\u201d\n\u201cVery gallant,\u201d said Ser Barristan, in a tone that suggested it was anything but, \u201cbut do you have tidings for Her Grace?\u201d\n\u201cHard tidings, Ser Grandfather. Astapor is gone, and the slavers are coming north in strength.\u201d\n\u201cThis is old news, and stale,\u201d growled the Shavepate.\n\u201cYour mother said the same of your father\u2019s kisses,\u201d Daario replied. \u201cSweet queen, I would have been here sooner, but the hills are aswarm with Yunkish sellswords. Four free companies. Your Stormcrows had to cut their way through all of them. There is more, and worse. The Yunkai\u2019i are marching their host up the coast road, joined by four legions out of New Ghis. They have elephants, a hundred, armored and towered. Tolosi slingers too, and a corps of Qartheen camelry. Two more Ghiscari legions took ship at Astapor. If our captives told it true, they will be landed beyond the Skahazadhan to cut us off from the Dothraki sea.\u201d\nAs he told his tale, from time to time a drop of bright red blood would patter against the marble floor, and Dany would wince. \u201cHow many men were killed?\u201d she asked when he was done.\n\u201cOf ours? I did not stop to count. We gained more than we lost, though.\u201d\n\u201cMore turncloaks?\u201d\n\u201cMore brave men drawn to your noble cause. My queen will like them. One is an axeman from the Basilisk Isles, a brute, bigger than Belwas. You should see him. Some Westerosi too, a score or more. Deserters from the Windblown, unhappy with the Yunkai\u2019i. They\u2019ll make good Stormcrows.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say.\u201d Dany would not quibble. Meereen might soon have need of every sword.\nSer Barristan frowned at Daario. \u201cCaptain, you made mention of four free companies. We know of only three. The Windblown, the Long Lances, and the Company of the Cat.\u201d\n\u201cSer Grandfather knows how to count. The Second Sons have gone over to the Yunkai\u2019i.\u201d Daario turned his head and spat. \u201cThat\u2019s for Brown Ben Plumm. When next I see his ugly face I will open him from throat to groin and rip out his black heart.\u201d\nDany tried to speak and found no words. She remembered Ben\u2019s face the last time she had seen it. It was a warm face, a face I trusted. Dark skin and white hair, the broken nose, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Even the dragons had been fond of old Brown Ben, who liked to boast that he had a drop of dragon blood himself. Three treasons will you know. Once for gold and once for blood and once for love. Was Plumm the third treason, or the second? And what did that make Ser Jorah, her gruff old bear? Would she never have a friend that she could trust? What good are prophecies if you cannot make sense of them? If I marry Hizdahr before the sun comes up, will all these armies melt away like morning dew and let me rule in peace?\nDaario\u2019s announcement had sparked an uproar. Reznak was wailing, the Shavepate was muttering darkly, her bloodriders were swearing vengeance. Strong Belwas thumped his scarred belly with his fist and swore to eat Brown Ben\u2019s heart with plums and onions. \u201cPlease,\u201d Dany said, but only Missandei seemed to hear. The queen got to her feet. \u201cBe quiet! I have heard enough.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Ser Barristan went to one knee. \u201cWe are yours to command. What would you have us do?\u201d\n\u201cContinue as we planned. Gather food, as much as you can.\u201d If I look back I am lost. \u201cWe must close the gates and put every fighting man upon the walls. No one enters, no one leaves.\u201d\nThe hall was quiet for a moment. The men looked at one another. Then Reznak said, \u201cWhat of the Astapori?\u201d\nShe wanted to scream, to gnash her teeth and tear her clothes and beat upon the floor. Instead she said, \u201cClose the gates. Will you make me say it thrice?\u201d They were her children, but she could not help them now. \u201cLeave me. Daario, remain. That cut should be washed, and I have more questions for you.\u201d\nThe others bowed and went. Dany took Daario Naharis up the steps to her bedchamber, where Irri washed his cut with vinegar and Jhiqui wrapped it in white linen. When that was done she sent her handmaids off as well. \u201cYour clothes are stained with blood,\u201d she told Daario. \u201cTake them off.\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you do the same.\u201d He kissed her.\nHis hair smelled of blood and smoke and horse, and his mouth was hard and hot on hers. Dany trembled in his arms. When they broke apart, she said, \u201cI thought you would be the one to betray me. Once for blood and once for gold and once for love, the warlocks said. I thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I never thought Brown Ben. Even my dragons seemed to trust him.\u201d She clutched her captain by the shoulders. \u201cPromise me that you will never turn against me. I could not bear that. Promise me.\u201d\n\u201cNever, my love.\u201d\nShe believed him. \u201cI swore that I should wed Hizdahr zo Loraq if he gave me ninety days of peace, but now\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I wanted you from the first time that I saw you, but you were a sellsword, fickle, treacherous. You boasted that you\u2019d had a hundred women.\u201d\n\u201cA hundred?\u201d Daario chuckled through his purple beard. \u201cI lied, sweet queen. It was a thousand. But never once a dragon.\u201d\nShe raised her lips to his. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d",

      "content": "THE PRINCE OF WINTERFELL\nThe hearth was caked with cold black ash, the room unheated but for candles. Every time a door opened their flames would sway and shiver. The bride was shivering too. They had dressed her in white lambswool trimmed with lace. Her sleeves and bodice were sewn with freshwater pearls, and on her feet were white doeskin slippers\u2014pretty, but not warm. Her face was pale, bloodless.\nA face carved of ice, Theon Greyjoy thought as he draped a fur-trimmed cloak about her shoulders. A corpse buried in the snow. \u201cMy lady. It is time.\u201d Beyond the door, the music called them, lute and pipes and drum.\nThe bride raised her eyes. Brown eyes, shining in the candlelight. \u201cI will be a good wife to him, and t-true. I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I will please him and give him sons. I will be a better wife than the real Arya could have been, he\u2019ll see.\u201d\nTalk like that will get you killed, or worse. That lesson he had learned as Reek. \u201cYou are the real Arya, my lady. Arya of House Stark, Lord Eddard\u2019s daughter, heir to Winterfell.\u201d Her name, she had to know her name. \u201cArya Underfoot. Your sister used to call you Arya Horseface.\u201d\n\u201cIt was me made up that name. Her face was long and horsey. Mine isn\u2019t. I was pretty.\u201d Tears spilled from her eyes at last. \u201cI was never beautiful like Sansa, but they all said I was pretty. Does Lord Ramsay think I am pretty?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he lied. \u201cHe\u2019s told me so.\u201d\n\u201cHe knows who I am, though. Who I really am. I see it when he looks at me. He looks so angry, even when he smiles, but it\u2019s not my fault. They say he likes to hurt people.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady should not listen to such\u00a0\u2026\u00a0lies.\u201d\n\u201cThey say that he hurt you. Your hands, and\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nHis mouth was dry. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I deserved it. I made him angry. You must not make him angry. Lord Ramsay is a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a sweet man, and kindly. Please him, and he will be good to you. Be a good wife.\u201d\n\u201cHelp me.\u201d She clutched at him. \u201cPlease. I used to watch you in the yard, playing with your swords. You were so handsome.\u201d She squeezed his arm. \u201cIf we ran away, I could be your wife, or your\u00a0\u2026\u00a0your whore\u00a0\u2026\u00a0whatever you wanted. You could be my man.\u201d\nTheon wrenched his arm away from her. \u201cI\u2019m no\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m no one\u2019s man.\u201d A man would help her. \u201cJust\u00a0\u2026\u00a0just be Arya, be his wife. Please him, or\u00a0\u2026\u00a0just please him, and stop this talk about being someone else.\u201d Jeyne, her name is Jeyne, it rhymes with pain. The music was growing more insistent. \u201cIt is time. Wipe those tears from your eyes.\u201d Brown eyes. They should be grey. Someone will see. Someone will remember. \u201cGood. Now smile.\u201d\nThe girl tried. Her lips, trembling, twitched up and froze, and he could see her teeth. Pretty white teeth, he thought, but if she angers him, they will not be pretty long. When he pushed the door open, three of the four candles fluttered out. He led the bride into the mist, where the wedding guests were waiting.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d he had asked when Lady Dustin told him he must give the bride away.\n\u201cHer father is dead and all her brothers. Her mother perished at the Twins. Her uncles are lost or dead or captive.\u201d\n\u201cShe has a brother still.\u201d She has three brothers still, he might have said. \u201cJon Snow is with the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\n\u201cA half-brother, bastard-born, and bound to the Wall. You were her father\u2019s ward, the nearest thing she has to living kin. It is only fitting that you give her hand in marriage.\u201d\nThe nearest thing she has to living kin. Theon Greyjoy had grown up with Arya Stark. Theon would have known an imposter. If he was seen to accept Bolton\u2019s feigned girl as Arya, the northern lords who had gathered to bear witness to the match would have no grounds to question her legitimacy. Stout and Slate, Whoresbane Umber, the quarrelsome Ryswells, Hornwood men and Cerywn cousins, fat Lord Wyman Manderly\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not one of them had known Ned Stark\u2019s daughters half so well as he. And if a few entertained private doubts, surely they would be wise enough to keep those misgivings to themselves.\nThey are using me to cloak their deception, putting mine own face on their lie. That was why Roose Bolton had clothed him as a lord again, to play his part in this mummer\u2019s farce. Once that was done, once their false Arya had been wedded and bedded, Bolton would have no more use for Theon Turncloak. \u201cServe us in this, and when Stannis is defeated we will discuss how best to restore you to your father\u2019s seat,\u201d his lordship had said in that soft voice of his, a voice made for lies and whispers. Theon never believed a word of it. He would dance this dance for them because he had no choice, but afterward\u00a0\u2026\u00a0He will give me back to Ramsay then, he thought, and Ramsay will take a few more fingers and turn me into Reek once more. Unless the gods were good, and Stannis Baratheon descended on Winterfell and put all of them to the sword, himself included. That was the best he could hope for.\nIt was warmer in the godswood, strange to say. Beyond its confines, a hard white frost gripped Winterfell. The paths were treacherous with black ice, and hoarfrost sparkled in the moonlight on the broken panes of the Glass Gardens. Drifts of dirty snow had piled up against the walls, filling every nook and corner. Some were so high they hid the doors behind them. Under the snow lay grey ash and cinders, and here and there a blackened beam or a pile of bones adorned with scraps of skin and hair. Icicles long as lances hung from the battlements and fringed the towers like an old man\u2019s stiff white whiskers. But inside the godswood, the ground remained unfrozen, and steam rose off the hot pools, as warm as baby\u2019s breath.\nThe bride was garbed in white and grey, the colors the true Arya would have worn had she lived long enough to wed. Theon wore black and gold, his cloak pinned to his shoulder by a crude iron kraken that a smith in Barrowton had hammered together for him. But under the hood, his hair was white and thin, and his flesh had an old man\u2019s greyish undertone. A Stark at last, he thought. Arm in arm, the bride and he passed through an arched stone door, as wisps of fog stirred round their legs. The drum was as tremulous as a maiden\u2019s heart, the pipes high and sweet and beckoning. Up above the treetops, a crescent moon was floating in a dark sky, half-obscured by mist, like an eye peering through a veil of silk.\nTheon Greyjoy was no stranger to this godswood. He had played here as a boy, skipping stones across the cold black pool beneath the weirwood, hiding his treasures in the bole of an ancient oak, stalking squirrels with a bow he made himself. Later, older, he had soaked his bruises in the hot springs after many a session in the yard with Robb and Jory and Jon Snow. In amongst these chestnuts and elms and soldier pines he had found secret places where he could hide when he wanted to be alone. The first time he had ever kissed a girl had been here. Later, a different girl had made a man of him upon a ragged quilt in the shade of that tall grey-green sentinel.\nHe had never seen the godswood like this, though\u2014grey and ghostly, filled with warm mists and floating lights and whispered voices that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Beneath the trees, the hot springs steamed. Warm vapors rose from the earth, shrouding the trees in their moist breath, creeping up the walls to draw grey curtains across the watching windows.\nThere was a path of sorts, a meandering footpath of cracked stones overgrown with moss, half-buried beneath blown dirt and fallen leaves and made treacherous by thick brown roots pushing up from underneath. He led the bride along it. Jeyne, her name is Jeyne, it rhymes with pain. He must not think that, though. Should that name pass his lips, it might cost him a finger or an ear. He walked slowly, watching every step. His missing toes made him hobble when he hurried, and it would not do to stumble. Mar Lord Ramsay\u2019s wedding with a misstep, and Lord Ramsay might rectify such clumsiness by flaying the offending foot.\nThe mists were so thick that only the nearest trees were visible; beyond them stood tall shadows and faint lights. Candles flickered beside the wandering path and back amongst the trees, pale fireflies floating in a warm grey soup. It felt like some strange underworld, some timeless place between the worlds, where the damned wandered mournfully for a time before finding their way down to whatever hell their sins had earned them. Are we all dead, then? Did Stannis come and kill us in our sleep? Is the battle yet to come, or has it been fought and lost?\nHere and there a torch burned hungrily, casting its ruddy glow over the faces of the wedding guests. The way the mists threw back the shifting light made their features seem bestial, half-human, twisted. Lord Stout became a mastiff, old Lord Locke a vulture, Whoresbane Umber a gargoyle, Big Walder Frey a fox, Little Walder a red bull, lacking only a ring for his nose. Roose Bolton\u2019s own face was a pale grey mask, with two chips of dirty ice where his eyes should be.\nAbove their heads the trees were full of ravens, their feathers fluffed as they hunched on bare brown branches, staring down at the pageantry below. Maester Luwin\u2019s birds. Luwin was dead, and his maester\u2019s tower had been put to the torch, yet the ravens lingered. This is their home. Theon wondered what that would be like, to have a home.\nThen the mists parted, like the curtain opening at a mummer show to reveal some new tableau. The heart tree appeared in front of them, its bony limbs spread wide. Fallen leaves lay about the wide white trunk in drifts of red and brown. The ravens were the thickest here, muttering to one another in the murderers\u2019 secret tongue. Ramsay Bolton stood beneath them, clad in high boots of soft grey leather and a black velvet doublet slashed with pink silk and glittering with garnet teardrops. A smile danced across his face. \u201cWho comes?\u201d His lips were moist, his neck red above his collar. \u201cWho comes before the god?\u201d\nTheon answered. \u201cArya of House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown and flowered, trueborn and noble, she comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?\u201d\n\u201cMe,\u201d said Ramsay. \u201cRamsay of House Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, heir to the Dreadfort. I claim her. Who gives her?\u201d\n\u201cTheon of House Greyjoy, who was her father\u2019s ward.\u201d He turned to the bride. \u201cLady Arya, will you take this man?\u201d\nShe raised her eyes to his. Brown eyes, not grey. Are all of them so blind? For a long moment she did not speak, but those eyes were begging. This is your chance, he thought. Tell them. Tell them now. Shout out your name before them all, tell them that you are not Arya Stark, let all the north hear how you were made to play this part. It would mean her death, of course, and his own as well, but Ramsay in his wroth might kill them quickly. The old gods of the north might grant them that small boon.\n\u201cI take this man,\u201d the bride said in a whisper.\nAll around them lights glimmered through the mists, a hundred candles pale as shrouded stars. Theon stepped back, and Ramsay and his bride joined hands and knelt before the heart tree, bowing their heads in token of submission. The weirwood\u2019s carved red eyes stared down at them, its great red mouth open as if to laugh. In the branches overhead a raven quorked.\nAfter a moment of silent prayer, the man and woman rose again. Ramsay undid the cloak that Theon had slipped about his bride\u2019s shoulders moments before, the heavy white wool cloak bordered in grey fur, emblazoned with the direwolf of House Stark. In its place he fastened a pink cloak, spattered with red garnets like those upon his doublet. On its back was the flayed man of the Dreadfort done in stiff red leather, grim and grisly.\nQuick as that, it was done. Weddings went more quickly in the north. It came of not having priests, Theon supposed, but whatever the reason it seemed to him a mercy. Ramsay Bolton scooped his wife up in his arms and strode through the mists with her. Lord Bolton and his Lady Walda followed, then the rest. The musicians began to play again, and the bard Abel began to sing \u201cTwo Hearts That Beat as One.\u201d Two of his women joined their voices to his own to make a sweet harmony.\nTheon found himself wondering if he should say a prayer. Will the old gods hear me if I do? They were not his gods, had never been his gods. He was ironborn, a son of Pyke, his god was the Drowned God of the islands\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Winterfell was long leagues from the sea. It had been a lifetime since any god had heard him. He did not know who he was, or what he was, why he was still alive, why he had ever been born.\n\u201cTheon,\u201d a voice seemed to whisper.\nHis head snapped up. \u201cWho said that?\u201d All he could see were the trees and the fog that covered them. The voice had been as faint as rustling leaves, as cold as hate. A god\u2019s voice, or a ghost\u2019s. How many died the day that he took Winterfell? How many more the day he lost it? The day that Theon Greyjoy died, to be reborn as Reek. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with shriek.\nSuddenly he did not want to be here.\nOnce outside the godswood the cold descended on him like a ravening wolf and caught him in its teeth. He lowered his head into the wind and made for the Great Hall, hastening after the long line of candles and torches. Ice crunched beneath his boots, and a sudden gust pushed back his hood, as if a ghost had plucked at him with frozen fingers, hungry to gaze upon his face.\nWinterfell was full of ghosts for Theon Greyjoy.\nThis was not the castle he remembered from the summer of his youth. This place was scarred and broken, more ruin than redoubt, a haunt of crows and corpses. The great double curtain wall still stood, for granite does not yield easily to fire, but most of the towers and keeps within were roofless. A few had collapsed. The thatch and timber had been consumed by fire, in whole or in part, and under the shattered panes of the Glass Garden the fruits and vegetables that would have fed the castle during the winter were dead and black and frozen. Tents filled the yard, half-buried in the snow. Roose Bolton had brought his host inside the walls, along with his friends the Freys; thousands huddled amongst the ruins, crowding every court, sleeping in cellar vaults and under topless towers, and in buildings abandoned for centuries.\nPlumes of grey smoke snaked up from the rebuilt kitchens and reroofed barracks keep. The battlements and crenellations were crowned with snow and hung with icicles. All the color had been leached from Winterfell until only grey and white remained. The Stark colors. Theon did not know whether he ought to find that ominous or reassuring. Even the sky was grey. Grey and grey and greyer. The whole world grey, everywhere you look, everything grey except the eyes of the bride. The eyes of the bride were brown. Big and brown and full of fear. It was not right that she should look to him for rescue. What had she been thinking, that he would whistle up a winged horse and fly her out of here, like some hero in the stories she and Sansa used to love? He could not even help himself. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with meek.\nAll about the yard, dead men hung half-frozen at the end of hempen ropes, swollen faces white with hoarfrost. Winterfell had been crawling with squatters when Bolton\u2019s van had reached the castle. More than two dozen had been driven at spearpoint from the nests they had made amongst the castle\u2019s half-ruined keeps and towers. The boldest and most truculent had been hanged, the rest put to work. Serve well, Lord Bolton told them, and he would be merciful. Stone and timber were plentiful with the wolfswood so close at hand. Stout new gates had gone up first, to replace those that had been burned. Then the collapsed roof of the Great Hall had been cleared away and a new one raised hurriedly in its stead. When the work was done, Lord Bolton hanged the workers. True to his word, he showed them mercy and did not flay a one.\nBy that time, the rest of Bolton\u2019s army had arrived. They raised King Tommen\u2019s stag and lion above the walls of Winterfell as the wind came howling from the north, and below it the flayed man of the Dreadfort. Theon arrived in Barbrey Dustin\u2019s train, with her ladyship herself, her Barrowton levies, and the bride-to-be. Lady Dustin had insisted that she should have custody of Lady Arya until such time as she was wed, but now that time was done. She belongs to Ramsay now. She said the words. By this marriage Ramsay would be Lord of Winterfell. So long as Jeyne took care not to anger him, he should have no cause to harm her. Arya. Her name is Arya.\nEven inside fur-lined gloves, Theon\u2019s hands had begun to throb with pain. It was often his hands that hurt the worst, especially his missing fingers. Had there truly been a time when women yearned for his touch? I made myself the Prince of Winterfell, he thought, and from that came all of this. He had thought that men would sing of him for a hundred years and tell tales of his daring. But if anyone spoke of him now, it was as Theon Turncloak, and the tales they told were of his treachery. This was never my home. I was a hostage here. Lord Stark had not treated him cruelly, but the long steel shadow of his greatsword had always been between them. He was kind to me, but never warm. He knew that one day he might need to put me to death.\nTheon kept his eyes downcast as he crossed the yard, weaving between the tents. I learned to fight in this yard, he thought, remembering warm summer days spent sparring with Robb and Jon Snow under the watchful eyes of old Ser Rodrik. That was back when he was whole, when he could grasp a sword hilt as well as any man. But the yard held darker memories as well. This was where he had assembled Stark\u2019s people the night Bran and Rickon fled the castle. Ramsay was Reek then, standing at his side, whispering that he should flay a few of his captives to make them tell him where the boys had gone. There will be no flaying here whilst I am Prince of Winterfell, Theon had responded, little dreaming how short his rule would prove. None of them would help me. I had known them all for half my life, and not one of them would help me. Even so, he had done his best to protect them, but once Ramsay put Reek\u2019s face aside he\u2019d slain all the men, and Theon\u2019s ironborn as well. He set my horse afire. That was the last sight he had seen the day the castle fell: Smiler burning, the flames leaping from his mane as he reared up, kicking, screaming, his eyes white with terror. Here in this very yard.\nThe doors of the Great Hall loomed up in front of him; new-made, to replace the doors that burned, they seemed crude and ugly to him, raw planks hastily joined. A pair of spearmen guarded them, hunched and shivering under thick fur cloaks, their beards crusty with ice. They eyed Theon resentfully as he hobbled up the steps, pushed against the right-hand door, and slipped inside.\nThe hall was blessedly warm and bright with torchlight, as crowded as he had ever seen it. Theon let the heat wash over him, then made his way toward the front of the hall. Men sat crammed knee to knee along the benches, so tightly packed that the servers had to squirm between them. Even the knights and lords above the salt enjoyed less space than usual.\nUp near the dais, Abel was plucking at his lute and singing \u201cFair Maids of Summer.\u201d He calls himself a bard. In truth he\u2019s more a pander. Lord Manderly had brought musicians from White Harbor, but none were singers, so when Abel turned up at the gates with a lute and six women, he had been made welcome. \u201cTwo sisters, two daughters, one wife, and my old mother,\u201d the singer claimed, though not one looked like him. \u201cSome dance, some sing, one plays the pipe and one the drums. Good washerwomen too.\u201d\nBard or pander, Abel\u2019s voice was passable, his playing fair. Here amongst the ruins, that was as much as anyone might expect.\nAlong the walls the banners hung: the horseheads of the Ryswells in gold, brown, grey, and black; the roaring giant of House Umber; the stone hand of House Flint of Flint\u2019s Finger; the moose of Hornwood and the merman of Manderly; Cerwyn\u2019s black battle-axe and the Tallhart pines. Yet their bright colors could not entirely cover the blackened walls behind them, nor the boards that closed the holes where windows once had been. Even the roof was wrong, its raw new timbers light and bright, where the old rafters had been stained almost black by centuries of smoke.\nThe largest banners were behind the dais, where the direwolf of Winterfell and the flayed man of the Dreadfort hung back of the bride and groom. The sight of the Stark banner hit Theon harder than he had expected. Wrong, it\u2019s wrong, as wrong as her eyes. The arms of House Poole were a blue plate on white, framed by a grey tressure. Those were the arms they should have hung.\n\u201cTheon Turncloak,\u201d someone said as he passed. Other men turned away at the sight of him. One spat. And why not? He was the traitor who had taken Winterfell by treachery, slain his foster brothers, delivered his own people to be flayed at Moat Cailin, and given his foster sister to Lord Ramsay\u2019s bed. Roose Bolton might make use of him, but true northmen must despise him.\nThe missing toes on his left foot had left him with a crabbed, awkward gait, comical to look upon. Back behind him, he heard a woman laugh. Even here in this half-frozen lichyard of a castle, surrounded by snow and ice and death, there were women. Washerwomen. That was the polite way of saying camp follower, which was the polite way of saying whore.\nWhere they came from Theon could not say. They just seemed to appear, like maggots on a corpse or ravens after a battle. Every army drew them. Some were hardened whores who could fuck twenty men in a night and drink them all blind. Others looked as innocent as maids, but that was just a trick of their trade. Some were camp brides, bound to the soldiers they followed with words whispered to one god or another but doomed to be forgotten once the war was done. They would warm a man\u2019s bed by night, patch the holes in his boots at morning, cook his supper come dusk, and loot his corpse after the battle. Some even did a bit of washing. With them, oft as not, came bastard children, wretched, filthy creatures born in one camp or the other. And even such as these made mock of Theon Turncloak. Let them laugh. His pride had perished here in Winterfell; there was no place for such in the dungeons of the Dreadfort. When you have known the kiss of a flaying knife, a laugh loses all its power to hurt you.\nBirth and blood accorded him a seat upon the dais at the end of the high table, beside a wall. To his left sat Lady Dustin, clad as ever in black wool, severe in cut and unadorned. To his right sat no one. They are all afraid the dishonor might rub off on them. If he had dared, he would have laughed.\nThe bride had the place of highest honor, between Ramsay and his father. She sat with eyes downcast as Roose Bolton bid them drink to Lady Arya. \u201cIn her children our two ancient houses will become as one,\u201d he said, \u201cand the long enmity between Stark and Bolton will be ended.\u201d His voice was so soft that the hall grew hushed as men strained to hear. \u201cI am sorry that our good friend Stannis has not seen fit to join us yet,\u201d he went on, to a ripple of laughter, \u201cas I know Ramsay had hoped to present his head to Lady Arya as a wedding gift.\u201d The laughs grew louder. \u201cWe shall give him a splendid welcome when he arrives, a welcome worthy of true northmen. Until that day, let us eat and drink and make merry\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for winter is almost upon us, my friends, and many of us here shall not live to see the spring.\u201d\nThe Lord of White Harbor had furnished the food and drink, black stout and yellow beer and wines red and gold and purple, brought up from the warm south on fat-bottomed ships and aged in his deep cellars. The wedding guests gorged on cod cakes and winter squash, hills of neeps and great round wheels of cheese, on smoking slabs of mutton and beef ribs charred almost black, and lastly on three great wedding pies, as wide across as wagon wheels, their flaky crusts stuffed to bursting with carrots, onions, turnips, parsnips, mushrooms, and chunks of seasoned pork swimming in a savory brown gravy. Ramsay hacked off slices with his falchion and Wyman Manderly himself served, presenting the first steaming portions to Roose Bolton and his fat Frey wife, the next to Ser Hosteen and Ser Aenys, the sons of Walder Frey. \u201cThe best pie you have ever tasted, my lords,\u201d the fat lord declared. \u201cWash it down with Arbor gold and savor every bite. I know I shall.\u201d\nTrue to his word, Manderly devoured six portions, two from each of the three pies, smacking his lips and slapping his belly and stuffing himself until the front of his tunic was half-brown with gravy stains and his beard was flecked with crumbs of crust. Even Fat Walda Frey could not match his gluttony, though she did manage three slices herself. Ramsay ate heartily as well, though his pale bride did no more than stare at the portion set before her. When she raised her head and looked at Theon, he could see the fear behind her big brown eyes.\nNo longswords had been allowed within the hall, but every man there wore a dagger, even Theon Greyjoy. How else to cut his meat? Every time he looked at the girl who had been Jeyne Poole, he felt the presence of that steel at his side. I have no way to save her, he thought, but I could kill her easy enough. No one would expect it. I could beg her for the honor of a dance and cut her throat. That would be a kindness, wouldn\u2019t it? And if the old gods hear my prayer, Ramsay in his wroth might strike me dead as well. Theon was not afraid to die. Underneath the Dreadfort, he had learned there were far worse things than death. Ramsay had taught him that lesson, finger by finger and toe by toe, and it was not one that he was ever like to forget.\n\u201cYou do not eat,\u201d observed Lady Dustin.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Eating was hard for him. Ramsay had left him with so many broken teeth that chewing was an agony. Drinking was easier, though he had to grasp the wine cup with both hands to keep from dropping it.\n\u201cNo taste for pork pie, my lord? The best pork pie we ever tasted, our fat friend would have us believe.\u201d She gestured toward Lord Manderly with her wine cup. \u201cHave you ever seen a fat man so happy? He is almost dancing. Serving with his own hands.\u201d\nIt was true. The Lord of White Harbor was the very picture of the jolly fat man, laughing and smiling, japing with the other lords and slapping them on the back, calling out to the musicians for this tune or that tune. \u201cGive us \u2018The Night That Ended,\u2019 singer,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cThe bride will like that one, I know. Or sing to us of brave young Danny Flint and make us weep.\u201d To look at him, you would have thought that he was the one newly wed.\n\u201cHe\u2019s drunk,\u201d said Theon.\n\u201cDrowning his fears. He is craven to the bone, that one.\u201d\nWas he? Theon was not certain. His sons had been fat as well, but they had not shamed themselves in battle. \u201cIronborn will feast before a battle too. A last taste of life, should death await. If Stannis comes\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe will. He must.\u201d Lady Dustin chuckled. \u201cAnd when he does, the fat man will piss himself. His son died at the Red Wedding, yet he\u2019s shared his bread and salt with Freys, welcomed them beneath his roof, promised one his granddaughter. He even serves them pie. The Manderlys ran from the south once, hounded from their lands and keeps by enemies. Blood runs true. The fat man would like to kill us all, I do not doubt, but he does not have the belly for it, for all his girth. Under that sweaty flesh beats a heart as craven and cringing as\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yours.\u201d\nHer last word was a lash, but Theon dared not answer back in kind. Any insolence would cost him skin. \u201cIf my lady believes Lord Manderly wants to betray us, Lord Bolton is the one to tell.\u201d\n\u201cYou think Roose does not know? Silly boy. Watch him. Watch how he watches Manderly. No dish so much as touches Roose\u2019s lips until he sees Lord Wyman eat of it first. No cup of wine is sipped until he sees Manderly drink of the same cask. I think he would be pleased if the fat man attempted some betrayal. It would amuse him. Roose has no feelings, you see. Those leeches that he loves so well sucked all the passions out of him years ago. He does not love, he does not hate, he does not grieve. This is a game to him, mildly diverting. Some men hunt, some hawk, some tumble dice. Roose plays with men. You and me, these Freys, Lord Manderly, his plump new wife, even his bastard, we are but his playthings.\u201d A serving man was passing by. Lady Dustin held out her wine cup and let him fill it, then gestured for him to do the same for Theon. \u201cTruth be told,\u201d she said, \u201cLord Bolton aspires to more than mere lordship. Why not King of the North? Tywin Lannister is dead, the Kingslayer is maimed, the Imp is fled. The Lannisters are a spent force, and you were kind enough to rid him of the Starks. Old Walder Frey will not object to his fat little Walda becoming a queen. White Harbor might prove troublesome should Lord Wyman survive this coming battle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I am quite sure that he will not. No more than Stannis. Roose will remove both of them, as he removed the Young Wolf. Who else is there?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d said Theon. \u201cThere is you. The Lady of Barrowton, a Dustin by marriage, a Ryswell by birth.\u201d\nThat pleased her. She took a sip of wine, her dark eyes sparkling, and said, \u201cThe widow of Barrowton\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and yes, if I so choose, I could be an inconvenience. Of course, Roose sees that too, so he takes care to keep me sweet.\u201d\nShe might have said more, but then she saw the maesters. Three of them had entered together by the lord\u2019s door behind the dais\u2014one tall, one plump, one very young, but in their robes and chains they were three grey peas from a black pod. Before the war, Medrick had served Lord Hornwood, Rhodry Lord Cerwyn, and young Henly Lord Slate. Roose Bolton had brought them all to Winterfell to take charge of Luwin\u2019s ravens, so messages might be sent and received from here again.\nAs Maester Medrick went to one knee to whisper in Bolton\u2019s ear, Lady Dustin\u2019s mouth twisted in distaste. \u201cIf I were queen, the first thing I would do would be to kill all those grey rats. They scurry everywhere, living on the leavings of the lords, chittering to one another, whispering in the ears of their masters. But who are the masters and who are the servants, truly? Every great lord has his maester, every lesser lord aspires to one. If you do not have a maester, it is taken to mean that you are of little consequence. The grey rats read and write our letters, even for such lords as cannot read themselves, and who can say for a certainty that they are not twisting the words for their own ends? What good are they, I ask you?\u201d\n\u201cThey heal,\u201d said Theon. It seemed to be expected of him.\n\u201cThey heal, yes. I never said they were not subtle. They tend to us when we are sick and injured, or distraught over the illness of a parent or a child. Whenever we are weakest and most vulnerable, there they are. Sometimes they heal us, and we are duly grateful. When they fail, they console us in our grief, and we are grateful for that as well. Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled.\n\u201cThat was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat\u2019s name. And isn\u2019t it clever how the maesters go by only one name, even those who had two when they first arrived at the Citadel? That way we cannot know who they truly are or where they come from\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if you are dogged enough, you can still find out. Before he forged his chain, Maester Walys had been known as Walys Flowers. Flowers, Hill, Rivers, Snow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and an archmaester of the Citadel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all. Once he forged his chain, his secret father and his friends wasted no time dispatching him to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard\u2019s ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey. The Tully marriage was his notion, never doubt it, he\u2014\u201d\nShe broke off as Roose Bolton rose to his feet, pale eyes shining in the torchlight. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he began, and a hush swept through the hall, so profound that Theon could hear the wind plucking at the boards over the windows. \u201cStannis and his knights have left Deepwood Motte, flying the banner of his new red god. The clans of the northern hills come with him on their shaggy runtish horses. If the weather holds, they could be on us in a fortnight. And Crowfood Umber marches down the kingsroad, whilst the Karstarks approach from the east. They mean to join with Lord Stannis here and take this castle from us.\u201d\nSer Hosteen Frey pushed to his feet. \u201cWe should ride forth to meet them. Why allow them to combine their strength?\u201d\nBecause Arnolf Karstark awaits only a sign from Lord Bolton before he turns his cloak, thought Theon, as other lords began to shout out counsel. Lord Bolton raised his hands for silence. \u201cThe hall is not the place for such discussions, my lords. Let us adjourn to the solar whilst my son consummates his marriage. The rest of you, remain and enjoy the food and drink.\u201d\nAs the Lord of the Dreadfort slipped out, attended by the three maesters, other lords and captains rose to follow. Hother Umber, the gaunt old man called Whoresbane, went grim-faced and scowling. Lord Manderly was so drunk he required four strong men to help him from the hall. \u201cWe should have a song about the Rat Cook,\u201d he was muttering, as he staggered past Theon, leaning on his knights. \u201cSinger, give us a song about the Rat Cook.\u201d\nLady Dustin was amongst the last to bestir herself. When she had gone, all at once the hall seemed stifling. It was not until Theon pushed himself to his feet that he realized how much he\u2019d drunk. When he stumbled from the table, he knocked a flagon from the hands of a serving girl. Wine splashed across his boots and breeches, a dark red tide.\nA hand grabbed his shoulder, five fingers hard as iron digging deep into his flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re wanted, Reek,\u201d said Sour Alyn, his breath foul with the smell from his rotten teeth. Yellow Dick and Damon Dance-for-Me were with him. \u201cRamsay says you\u2019re to bring his bride to his bed.\u201d\nA shiver of fear went through him. I played my part, he thought. Why me? He knew better than to object, though.\nLord Ramsay had already left the hall. His bride, forlorn and seemingly forgotten, sat hunched and silent beneath the banner of House Stark, clutching a silver goblet in both hands. Judging from the way she looked at him when he approached, she had emptied that goblet more than once. Perhaps she hoped that if she drank enough, the ordeal would pass her by. Theon knew better. \u201cLady Arya,\u201d he said. \u201cCome. It is time you did your duty.\u201d\nSix of the Bastard\u2019s boys accompanied them as Theon led the girl out the back of the hall and across the frigid yard to the Great Keep. It was up three flights of stone steps to Lord Ramsay\u2019s bedchamber, one of the rooms the fires had touched but lightly. As they climbed, Damon Dance-for-Me whistled, whilst Skinner boasted that Lord Ramsay had promised him a piece of the bloody sheet as a mark of special favor.\nThe bedchamber had been well prepared for the consummation. All the furnishings were new, brought up from Barrowton in the baggage train. The canopy bed had a feather mattress and drapes of blood-red velvet. The stone floor was covered with wolfskins. A fire was burning in the hearth, a candle on the bedside table. On the sideboard was a flagon of wine, two cups, and a half wheel of veined white cheese.\nThere was a chair as well, carved of black oak with a red leather seat. Lord Ramsay was seated in it when they entered. Spittle glistened on his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s my sweet maid. Good lads. You may leave us now. Not you, Reek. You stay.\u201d\nReek, Reek, it rhymes with peek. He could feel his missing fingers cramping: two on his left hand, one on his right. And on his hip his dagger rested, sleeping in its leather sheath, but heavy, oh so heavy. It is only my pinky gone on my right hand, Theon reminded himself. I can still grip a knife. \u201cMy lord. How may I serve you?\u201d\n\u201cYou gave the wench to me. Who better to unwrap the gift? Let\u2019s have a look at Ned Stark\u2019s little daughter.\u201d\nShe is no kin to Lord Eddard, Theon almost said. Ramsay knows, he has to know. What new cruel game is this? The girl was standing by a bedpost, trembling like a doe. \u201cLady Arya, if you will turn your back, I must needs unlace your gown.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lord Ramsay poured himself a cup of wine. \u201cLaces take too long. Cut it off her.\u201d\nTheon drew the dagger. All I need do is turn and stab him. The knife is in my hand. He knew the game by then. Another trap, he told himself, remembering Kyra with her keys. He wants me to try to kill him. And when I fail, he\u2019ll flay the skin from the hand I used to hold the blade. He grabbed a handful of the bride\u2019s skirt. \u201cStand still, my lady.\u201d The gown was loose below the waist, so that was where he slid the blade in, slicing upward slowly, so as not to cut her. Steel whispered through wool and silk with a faint, soft sound. The girl was shaking. Theon had to grab her arm to hold her still. Jeyne, Jeyne, it rhymes with pain. He tightened his grip, as much as his maimed left hand would allow. \u201cStay still.\u201d\nFinally the gown fell away, a pale tangle round her feet. \u201cHer smallclothes too,\u201d Ramsay commanded. Reek obeyed.\nWhen it was done the bride stood naked, her bridal finery a heap of white and grey rags about her feet. Her breasts were small and pointed, her hips narrow and girlish, her legs as skinny as a bird\u2019s. A child. Theon had forgotten how young she was. Sansa\u2019s age. Arya would be even younger. Despite the fire in the hearth, the bedchamber was chilly. Jeyne\u2019s pale skin was pebbled with gooseprickles. There was a moment when her hands rose, as if to cover her breasts, but Theon mouthed a silent no and she saw and stopped at once.\n\u201cWhat do you think of her, Reek?\u201d asked Lord Ramsay.\n\u201cShe\u00a0\u2026\u201d What answer does he want? What was it the girl had said, before the godswood? They all said that I was pretty. She was not pretty now. He could see a spiderweb of faint thin lines across her back where someone had whipped her. \u201c\u2026\u00a0she is beautiful, so\u00a0\u2026\u00a0so beautiful.\u201d\nRamsay smiled his wet smile. \u201cDoes she make your cock hard, Reek? Is it straining against your laces? Would you like to fuck her first?\u201d He laughed. \u201cThe Prince of Winterfell should have that right, as all lords did in days of old. The first night. But you\u2019re no lord, are you? Only Reek. Not even a man, truth be told.\u201d He took another gulp of wine, then threw the cup across the room to shatter off a wall. Red rivers ran down across the stone. \u201cLady Arya. Get on the bed. Yes, against the pillows, that\u2019s a good wife. Now spread your legs. Let us see your cunt.\u201d\nThe girl obeyed, wordless. Theon took a step back toward the door. Lord Ramsay sat beside his bride, slid his hand along her inner thigh, then jammed two fingers up inside her. The girl let out a gasp of pain. \u201cYou\u2019re dry as an old bone.\u201d Ramsay pulled his hand free and slapped her face. \u201cI was told that you\u2019d know how to please a man. Was that a lie?\u201d\n\u201cN-no, my lord. I was t-trained.\u201d\nRamsay rose, the firelight shining on his face. \u201cReek, get over here. Get her ready for me.\u201d\nFor a moment he did not understand. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0do you mean\u00a0\u2026\u00a0m\u2019lord, I have no\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWith your mouth,\u201d Lord Ramsay said. \u201cAnd be quick about it. If she\u2019s not wet by the time I\u2019m done disrobing, I will cut off that tongue of yours and nail it to the wall.\u201d\nSomewhere in the godswood, a raven screamed. The dagger was still in his hand.\nHe sheathed it.\nReek, my name is Reek, it rhymes with weak.\nReek bent to his task.",

      "content": "THE WATCHER\nLet us look upon this head,\u201d his prince commanded.\nAreo Hotah ran his hand along the smooth shaft of his longaxe, his ash-and-iron wife, all the while watching. He watched the white knight, Ser Balon Swann, and the others who had come with him. He watched the Sand Snakes, each at a different table. He watched the lords and ladies, the serving men, the old blind seneschal, and the young maester Myles, with his silky beard and servile smile. Standing half in light and half in shadow, he saw all of them. Serve. Protect. Obey. That was his task.\nAll the rest had eyes only for the chest. It was carved of ebony, with silver clasps and hinges. A fine-looking box, no doubt, but many of those assembled here in the Old Palace of Sunspear might soon be dead, depending on what was in that chest.\nHis slippers whispering against the floor, Maester Caleotte crossed the hall to Ser Balon Swann. The round little man looked splendid in his new robes, with their broad bands of dun and butternut and narrow stripes of red. Bowing, he took the chest from the hands of the white knight and carried it to the dais, where Doran Martell sat in his rolling chair between his daughter Arianne and his dead brother\u2019s beloved paramour, Ellaria. A hundred scented candles perfumed the air. Gemstones glittered on the fingers of the lords and the girdles and hairnets of the ladies. Areo Hotah had polished his shirt of copper scales mirror-bright so he would blaze in the candlelight as well.\nA hush had fallen across the hall. Dorne holds its breath. Maester Caleotte set the box on the floor beside Prince Doran\u2019s chair. The maester\u2019s fingers, normally so sure and deft, turned clumsy as he worked the latch and opened the lid, to reveal the skull within. Hotah heard someone clear his throat. One of the Fowler twins whispered something to the other. Ellaria Sand had closed her eyes and was murmuring a prayer.\nSer Balon Swann was taut as a drawn bow, the captain of guards observed. This new white knight was not so tall nor comely as the old one, but he was bigger across the chest, burlier, his arms thick with muscle. His snowy cloak was clasped at the throat by two swans on a silver brooch. One was ivory, the other onyx, and it seemed to Areo Hotah as if the two of them were fighting. The man who wore them looked a fighter too. This one will not die so easy as the other. He will not charge into my axe the way Ser Arys did. He will stand behind his shield and make me come at him. If it came to that, Hotah would be ready. His longaxe was sharp enough to shave with.\nHe allowed himself a brief glance at the chest. The skull rested on a bed of black felt, grinning. All skulls grinned, but this one seemed happier than most. And bigger. The captain of guards had never seen a larger skull. Its brow shelf was thick and heavy, its jaw massive. The bone shone in the candlelight, white as Ser Balon\u2019s cloak. \u201cPlace it on the pedestal,\u201d the prince commanded. He had tears glistening in his eyes.\nThe pedestal was a column of black marble three feet taller than Maester Caleotte. The fat little maester hopped up on his toes but still could not quite reach. Areo Hotah was about to go and help him, but Obara Sand moved first. Even without her whip and shield, she had an angry mannish look to her. In place of a gown, she wore men\u2019s breeches and a calf-length linen tunic, cinched at the waist with a belt of copper suns. Her brown hair was tied back in a knot. Snatching the skull from the maester\u2019s soft pink hands, she placed it up atop the marble column.\n\u201cThe Mountain rides no more,\u201d the prince said, gravely.\n\u201cWas his dying long and hard, Ser Balon?\u201d asked Tyene Sand, in the tone a maiden might use to ask if her gown was pretty.\n\u201cHe screamed for days, my lady,\u201d the white knight replied, though it was plain that it pleased him little to say so. \u201cWe could hear him all over the Red Keep.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that trouble you, ser?\u201d asked the Lady Nym. She wore a gown of yellow silk so sheer and fine that the candles shone right through it to reveal the spun gold and jewels beneath. So immodest was her garb that the white knight seemed uncomfortable looking at her, but Hotah approved. Nymeria was least dangerous when nearly naked. Elsewise she was sure to have a dozen blades concealed about her person. \u201cSer Gregor was a bloody brute, all men agree. If ever a man deserved to suffer, it was him.\u201d\n\u201cThat is as it may be, my lady,\u201d said Balon Swann, \u201cbut Ser Gregor was a knight, and a knight should die with sword in hand. Poison is a foul and filthy way to kill.\u201d\nLady Tyene smiled at that. Her gown was cream and green, with long lace sleeves, so modest and so innocent that any man who looked at her might think her the most chaste of maids. Areo Hotah knew better. Her soft, pale hands were as deadly as Obara\u2019s callused ones, if not more so. He watched her carefully, alert to every little flutter of her fingers.\nPrince Doran frowned. \u201cThat is so, Ser Balon, but the Lady Nym is right. If ever a man deserved to die screaming, it was Gregor Clegane. He butchered my good sister, smashed her babe\u2019s head against a wall. I only pray that now he is burning in some hell, and that Elia and her children are at peace. This is the justice that Dorne has hungered for. I am glad that I lived long enough to taste it. At long last the Lannisters have proved the truth of their boast and paid this old blood debt.\u201d\nThe prince left it to Ricasso, his blind seneschal, to rise and propose the toast. \u201cLords and ladies, let us all now drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\nServing men had begun to move amongst the guests as the seneschal was speaking, filling cups from the flagons that they bore. The wine was Dornish strongwine, dark as blood and sweet as vengeance. The captain did not drink of it. He never drank at feasts. Nor did the prince himself partake. He had his own wine, prepared by Maester Myles and well laced with poppy juice to ease the agony in his swollen joints.\nThe white knight did drink, as was only courteous. His companions likewise. So did the Princess Arianne, Lady Jordayne, the Lord of Godsgrace, the Knight of Lemonwood, the Lady of Ghost Hill\u00a0\u2026\u00a0even Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn\u2019s beloved paramour, who had been with him in King\u2019s Landing when he died. Hotah paid more note to those who did not drink: Ser Daemon Sand, Lord Tremond Gargalen, the Fowler twins, Dagos Manwoody, the Ullers of the Hellholt, the Wyls of the Boneway. If there is trouble, it could start with one of them. Dorne was an angry and divided land, and Prince Doran\u2019s hold on it was not as firm as it might be. Many of his own lords thought him weak and would have welcomed open war with the Lannisters and the boy king on the Iron Throne.\nChief amongst those were the Sand Snakes, the bastard daughters of the prince\u2019s late brother Oberyn, the Red Viper, three of whom were at the feast. Doran Martell was the wisest of princes, and it was not the place of his captain of guards to question his decisions, but Areo Hotah did wonder why he had chosen to release the ladies Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene from their lonely cells in the Spear Tower.\nTyene declined Ricasso\u2019s toast with a murmur and Lady Nym with a flick of a hand. Obara let them fill her cup to the brim, then upended it to spill the red wine on the floor. When a serving girl knelt to wipe up the spilled wine, Obara left the hall. After a moment Princess Arianne excused herself and went after her. Obara would never turn her rage on the little princess, Hotah knew. They are cousins, and she loves her well.\nThe feast continued late into the night, presided over by the grinning skull on its pillar of black marble. Seven courses were served, in honor of the seven gods and the seven brothers of the Kingsguard. The soup was made with eggs and lemons, the long green peppers stuffed with cheese and onions. There were lamprey pies, capons glazed with honey, a whiskerfish from the bottom of the Greenblood that was so big it took four serving men to carry it to table. After that came a savory snake stew, chunks of seven different sorts of snake slow-simmered with dragon peppers and blood oranges and a dash of venom to give it a good bite. The stew was fiery hot, Hotah knew, though he tasted none of it. Sherbet followed, to cool the tongue. For the sweet, each guest was served a skull of spun sugar. When the crust was broken, they found sweet custard inside and bits of plum and cherry.\nPrincess Arianne returned in time for the stuffed peppers. My little princess, Hotah thought, but Arianne was a woman now. The scarlet silks she wore left no doubt of that. Of late she had changed in other ways as well. Her plot to crown Myrcella had been betrayed and smashed, her white knight had perished bloodily at Hotah\u2019s hand, and she herself had been confined to the Spear Tower, condemned to solitude and silence. All of that had chastened her. There was something else as well, though, some secret her father had confided in her before releasing her from her confinement. What that was, the captain did not know.\nThe prince had placed his daughter between himself and the white knight, a place of high honor. Arianne smiled as she slipped into her seat again, and murmured something in Ser Balon\u2019s ear. The knight did not choose to respond. He ate little, Hotah observed: a spoon of soup, a bite of the pepper, the leg off a capon, some fish. He shunned the lamprey pie and tried only one small spoonful of the stew. Even that made his brow break out in sweat. Hotah could sympathize. When first he came to Dorne, the fiery food would tie his bowels in knots and burn his tongue. That was years ago, however; now his hair was white, and he could eat anything a Dornishman could eat.\nWhen the spun-sugar skulls were served, Ser Balon\u2019s mouth grew tight, and he gave the prince a lingering look to see if he was being mocked. Doran Martell took no notice, but his daughter did. \u201cIt is the cook\u2019s little jape, Ser Balon,\u201d said Arianne. \u201cEven death is not sacred to a Dornishmen. You won\u2019t be cross with us, I pray?\u201d She brushed the back of the white knight\u2019s hand with her fingers. \u201cI hope you have enjoyed your time in Dorne.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone has been most hospitable, my lady.\u201d\nArianne touched the pin that clasped his cloak, with its quarreling swans. \u201cI have always been fond of swans. No other bird is half so beautiful, this side of the Summer Isles.\u201d\n\u201cYour peacocks might dispute that,\u201d said Ser Balon.\n\u201cThey might,\u201d said Arianne, \u201cbut peacocks are vain, proud creatures, strutting about in all those gaudy colors. Give me a swan serene in white or beautiful in black.\u201d\nSer Balon gave a nod and sipped his wine. This one is not so easily seduced as was his Sworn Brother, Hotah thought. Ser Arys was a boy, despite his years. This one is a man, and wary. The captain had only to look at him to see that the white knight was ill at ease. This place is strange to him, and little to his liking. Hotah could understand that. Dorne had seemed a queer place to him as well when first he came here with his own princess, many years ago. The bearded priests had drilled him on the Common Speech of Westeros before they sent him forth, but the Dornishmen all spoke too quickly for him to understand. Dornish women were lewd, Dornish wine was sour, and Dornish food was full of queer hot spices. And the Dornish sun was hotter than the pale, wan sun of Norvos, glaring down from a blue sky day after day.\nSer Balon\u2019s journey had been shorter but troubling in its own way, the captain knew. Three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, and sundry grooms and servants had accompanied him from King\u2019s Landing, but once they crossed the mountains into Dorne their progress had been slowed by a round of feasts, hunts, and celebrations at every castle that they chanced to pass. And now that they had reached Sunspear, neither Princess Myrcella nor Ser Arys Oakheart was on hand to greet them. The white knight knows that something is amiss, Hotah could tell, but it is more than that. Perhaps the presence of the Sand Snakes unnerved him. If so, Obara\u2019s return to the hall must have been vinegar in the wound. She slipped back into her place without a word, and sat there sullen and scowling, neither smiling nor speaking.\nMidnight was close at hand when Prince Doran turned to the white knight and said, \u201cSer Balon, I have read the letter that you brought me from our gracious queen. Might I assume that you are familiar with its contents, ser?\u201d\nHotah saw the knight tense. \u201cI am, my lord. Her Grace informed me that I might be called upon to escort her daughter back to King\u2019s Landing. King Tommen has been pining for his sister and would like Princess Myrcella to return to court for a short visit.\u201d\nPrincess Arianne made a sad face. \u201cOh, but we have all grown so fond of Myrcella, ser. She and my brother Trystane have become inseparable.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Trystane would be welcome in King\u2019s Landing as well,\u201d said Balon Swann. \u201cKing Tommen would wish to meet him, I am sure. His Grace has so few companions near his own age.\u201d\n\u201cThe bonds formed in boyhood can last a man for life,\u201d said Prince Doran. \u201cWhen Trystane and Myrcella wed, he and Tommen will be as brothers. Queen Cersei has the right of it. The boys should meet, become friends. Dorne will miss him, to be sure, but it is past time Trystane saw something of the world beyond the walls of Sunspear.\u201d\n\u201cI know King\u2019s Landing will welcome him most warmly.\u201d\nWhy is he sweating now? the captain wondered, watching. The hall is cool enough, and he never touched the stew.\n\u201cAs for the other matter that Queen Cersei raises,\u201d Prince Doran was saying, \u201cit is true, Dorne\u2019s seat upon the small council has been vacant since my brother\u2019s death, and it is past time that it was filled again. I am flattered that Her Grace feels my counsel might be of use to her, though I wonder if I have the strength for such a journey. Perhaps if we went by sea?\u201d\n\u201cBy ship?\u201d Ser Balon seemed taken aback. \u201cThat\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would that be safe, my prince? Autumn is a bad season for storms, or so I\u2019ve heard, and\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the pirates in the Stepstones, they\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe pirates. To be sure. You may be right, ser. Safer to return the way you came.\u201d Prince Doran smiled pleasantly. \u201cLet us talk again on the morrow. When we reach the Water Gardens, we can tell Myrcella. I know how excited she will be. She misses her brother too, I do not doubt.\u201d\n\u201cI am eager to see her once again,\u201d said Ser Balon. \u201cAnd to visit your Water Gardens. I\u2019ve heard they are very beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cBeautiful and peaceful,\u201d the prince said. \u201cCool breezes, sparkling water, and the laughter of children. The Water Gardens are my favorite place in this world, ser. One of my ancestors had them built to please his Targaryen bride and free her from the dust and heat of Sunspear. Daenerys was her name. She was sister to King Daeron the Good, and it was her marriage that made Dorne part of the Seven Kingdoms. The whole realm knew that the girl loved Daeron\u2019s bastard brother Daemon Blackfyre, and was loved by him in turn, but the king was wise enough to see that the good of thousands must come before the desires of two, even if those two were dear to him. It was Daenerys who filled the gardens with laughing children. Her own children at the start, but later the sons and daughters of lords and landed knights were brought in to be companions to the boys and girls of princely blood. And one summer\u2019s day when it was scorching hot, she took pity on the children of her grooms and cooks and serving men and invited them to use the pools and fountains too, a tradition that has endured till this day.\u201d The prince grasped the wheels of his chair and pushed himself from the table. \u201cBut now you must excuse me, ser. All this talk has wearied me, and we should leave at break of day. Obara, would you be so kind as to help me to my bed? Nymeria, Tyene, come as well, and bid your old uncle a fond good night.\u201d\nSo it fell to Obara Sand to roll the prince\u2019s chair from Sunspear\u2019s feast hall and down a long gallery to his solar. Areo Hotah followed with her sisters, along with Princess Arianne and Ellaria Sand. Maester Caleotte hurried behind on slippered feet, cradling the Mountain\u2019s skull as if it were a child.\n\u201cYou cannot seriously intend to send Trystane and Myrcella to King\u2019s Landing,\u201d Obara said as she was pushing. Her strides were long and angry, much too fast, and the chair\u2019s big wooden wheels clacked noisily across rough-cut stone floors. \u201cDo that, and we will never see the girl again, and your son will spend his life a hostage to the Iron Throne.\u201d\n\u201cDo you take me for a fool, Obara?\u201d The prince sighed. \u201cThere is much you do not know. Things best not discussed here, where anyone can hear. If you hold your tongue, I may enlighten you.\u201d He winced. \u201cSlower, for the love you bear me. That last jolt sent a knife right through my knee.\u201d\nObara slowed her pace by half. \u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d\nHer sister Tyene gave answer. \u201cWhat he always does,\u201d she purred. \u201cDelay, obscure, prevaricate. Oh, no one does that half so well as our brave uncle.\u201d\n\u201cYou do him wrong,\u201d said Princess Arianne.\n\u201cBe quiet, all of you,\u201d the prince commanded.\nNot until the doors of his solar were safely closed behind them did he wheel his chair about to face the women. Even that effort left him breathless, and the Myrish blanket that covered his legs caught between two spokes as he rolled, so he had to clutch it to keep it from being torn away. Beneath the coverlet, his legs were pale, soft, ghastly. Both of his knees were red and swollen, and his toes were almost purple, twice the size they should have been. Areo Hotah had seen them a thousand times and still found them hard to look upon.\nPrincess Arianne came forward. \u201cLet me help you, Father.\u201d\nThe prince pulled the blanket free. \u201cI can still master mine own blanket. That much at least.\u201d It was little enough. His legs had been useless for three years, but there was still some strength in his hands and shoulders.\n\u201cShall I fetch my prince a thimble cup of milk of the poppy?\u201d Maester Caleotte asked.\n\u201cI would need a bucket, with this pain. Thank you, but no. I want my wits about me. I\u2019ll have no more need of you tonight.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, my prince.\u201d Maester Caleotte bowed, Ser Gregor\u2019s head still clutched in his soft pink hands.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Obara Sand plucked the skull from him and held it at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWhat did the Mountain look like? How do we know that this is him? They could have dipped the head in tar. Why strip it to the bone?\u201d\n\u201cTar would have ruined the box,\u201d suggested Lady Nym, as Maester Caleotte scurried off. \u201cNo one saw the Mountain die, and no one saw his head removed. That troubles me, I confess, but what could the bitch queen hope to accomplish by deceiving us? If Gregor Clegane is alive, soon or late the truth will out. The man was eight feet tall, there is not another like him in all of Westeros. If any such appears again, Cersei Lannister will be exposed as a liar before all the Seven Kingdoms. She would be an utter fool to risk that. What could she hope to gain?\u201d\n\u201cThe skull is large enough, no doubt,\u201d said the prince. \u201cAnd we know that Oberyn wounded Gregor grievously. Every report we have had since claims that Clegane died slowly, in great pain.\u201d\n\u201cJust as Father intended,\u201d said Tyene. \u201cSisters, truly, I know the poison Father used. If his spear so much as broke the Mountain\u2019s skin, Clegane is dead, I do not care how big he was. Doubt your little sister if you like, but never doubt our sire.\u201d\nObara bristled. \u201cI never did and never shall.\u201d She gave the skull a mocking kiss. \u201cThis is a start, I\u2019ll grant.\u201d\n\u201cA start?\u201d said Ellaria Sand, incredulous. \u201cGods forbid. I would it were a finish. Tywin Lannister is dead. So are Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch, and now Gregor Clegane, all those who had a hand in murdering Elia and her children. Even Joffrey, who was not yet born when Elia died. I saw the boy perish with mine own eyes, clawing at his throat as he tried to draw a breath. Who else is there to kill? Do Myrcella and Tommen need to die so the shades of Rhaenys and Aegon can be at rest? Where does it end?\u201d\n\u201cIt ends in blood, as it began,\u201d said Lady Nym. \u201cIt ends when Casterly Rock is cracked open, so the sun can shine on the maggots and the worms within. It ends with the utter ruin of Tywin Lannister and all his works.\u201d\n\u201cThe man died at the hand of his own son,\u201d Ellaria snapped back. \u201cWhat more could you wish?\u201d\n\u201cI could wish that he died at my hand.\u201d Lady Nym settled in a chair, her long black braid falling across one shoulder to her lap. She had her father\u2019s widow\u2019s peak. Beneath it her eyes were large and lustrous. Her wine-red lips curled in a silken smile. \u201cIf he had, his dying would not have been so easy.\u201d\n\u201cSer Gregor does look lonely,\u201d said Tyene, in her sweet septa\u2019s voice. \u201cHe would like some company, I\u2019m certain.\u201d\nEllaria\u2019s cheeks were wet with tears, her dark eyes shining. Even weeping, she has a strength in her, the captain thought.\n\u201cOberyn wanted vengeance for Elia. Now the three of you want vengeance for him. I have four daughters, I remind you. Your sisters. My Elia is fourteen, almost a woman. Obella is twelve, on the brink of maidenhood. They worship you, as Dorea and Loreza worship them. If you should die, must El and Obella seek vengeance for you, then Dorea and Loree for them? Is that how it goes, round and round forever? I ask again, where does it end?\u201d Ellaria Sand laid her hand on the Mountain\u2019s head. \u201cI saw your father die. Here is his killer. Can I take a skull to bed with me, to give me comfort in the night? Will it make me laugh, write me songs, care for me when I am old and sick?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you have us do, my lady?\u201d asked the Lady Nym. \u201cShall we lay down our spears and smile, and forget all the wrongs that have been done to us?\u201d\n\u201cWar will come, whether we wish it or not,\u201d said Obara. \u201cA boy king sits the Iron Throne. Lord Stannis holds the Wall and is gathering northmen to his cause. The two queens are squabbling over Tommen like bitches with a juicy bone. The ironmen have taken the Shields and are raiding up the Mander, deep into the heart of the Reach, which means Highgarden will be preoccupied as well. Our enemies are in disarray. The time is ripe.\u201d\n\u201cRipe for what? To make more skulls?\u201d Ellaria Sand turned to the prince. \u201cThey will not see. I can hear no more of this.\u201d\n\u201cGo back to your girls, Ellaria,\u201d the prince told her. \u201cI swear to you, no harm will come to them.\u201d\n\u201cMy prince.\u201d Ellaria kissed him on the brow and took her leave. Areo Hotah was sad to see her go. She is a good woman.\nWhen she had gone, Lady Nym said, \u201cI know she loved our father well, but it is plain she never understood him.\u201d\nThe prince gave her a curious look. \u201cShe understood more than you ever will, Nymeria. And she made your father happy. In the end a gentle heart may be worth more than pride or valor. Be that as it may, there are things Ellaria does not know and should not know. This war has already begun.\u201d\nObara laughed. \u201cAye, our sweet Arianne has seen to that.\u201d\nThe princess flushed, and Hotah saw a spasm of anger pass across her father\u2019s face. \u201cWhat she did, she did as much for you as for herself. I would not be so quick to mock.\u201d\n\u201cThat was praise,\u201d Obara Sand insisted. \u201cProcrastinate, obscure, prevaricate, dissemble, and delay all you like, Uncle, Ser Balon must still come face-to-face with Myrcella at the Water Gardens, and when he does he\u2019s like to see she\u2019s short an ear. And when the girl tells him how your captain cut Arys Oakheart from neck to groin with that steel wife of his, well\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Princess Arianne unfolded from the cushion where she sat and put a hand on Hotah\u2019s arm. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t how it happened, Cousin. Ser Arys was slain by Gerold Dayne.\u201d\nThe Sand Snakes looked at one another. \u201cDarkstar?\u201d\n\u201cDarkstar did it,\u201d his little princess said. \u201cHe tried to kill Princess Myrcella too. As she will tell Ser Balon.\u201d\nNym smiled. \u201cThat part at least is true.\u201d\n\u201cIt is all true,\u201d said the prince, with a wince of pain. Is it his gout that hurts him, or the lie? \u201cAnd now Ser Gerold has fled back to High Hermitage, beyond our reach.\u201d\n\u201cDarkstar,\u201d Tyene murmured, with a giggle. \u201cWhy not? It is all his doing. But will Ser Balon believe it?\u201d\n\u201cHe will if he hears it from Myrcella,\u201d Arianne insisted.\nObara snorted in disbelief. \u201cShe may lie today and lie tomorrow, but soon or late she\u2019ll tell the truth. If Ser Balon is allowed to carry tales back to King\u2019s Landing, drums will sound and blood will flow. He should not be allowed to leave.\u201d\n\u201cWe could kill him, to be sure,\u201d said Tyene, \u201cbut then we would need to kill the rest of his party too, even those sweet young squires. That would be\u00a0\u2026\u00a0oh, so messy.\u201d\nPrince Doran shut his eyes and opened them again. Hotah could see his leg trembling underneath the blanket. \u201cIf you were not my brother\u2019s daughters, I would send the three of you back to your cells and keep you there until your bones were grey. Instead I mean to take you with us to the Water Gardens. There are lessons there if you have the wit to see them.\u201d\n\u201cLessons?\u201d said Obara. \u201cAll I\u2019ve seen are naked children.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d the prince said. \u201cI told the story to Ser Balon, but not all of it. As the children splashed in the pools, Daenerys watched from amongst the orange trees, and a realization came to her. She could not tell the highborn from the low. Naked, they were only children. All innocent, all vulnerable, all deserving of long life, love, protection. \u2018There is your realm,\u2019 she told her son and heir, \u2018remember them, in everything you do.\u2019 My own mother said those same words to me when I was old enough to leave the pools. It is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.\n\u201cI am not blind, nor deaf. I know that you all believe me weak, frightened, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes. Your father and I worked more closely than you know\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but now he is gone. The question is, can I trust his daughters to serve me in his place?\u201d\nHotah studied each of them in turn. Obara, rusted nails and boiled leather, with her angry, close-set eyes and rat-brown hair. Nymeria, languid, elegant, olive-skinned, her long black braid bound up in red-gold wire. Tyene, blue-eyed and blond, a child-woman with her soft hands and little giggles.\nTyene answered for the three of them. \u201cIt is doing nothing that is hard, Uncle. Set a task for us, any task, and you shall find us as leal and obedient as any prince could hope for.\u201d\n\u201cThat is good to hear,\u201d the prince said, \u201cbut words are wind. You are my brother\u2019s daughters and I love you, but I have learned I cannot trust you. I want your oath. Will you swear to serve me, to do as I command?\u201d\n\u201cIf we must,\u201d said Lady Nym.\n\u201cThen swear it now, upon your father\u2019s grave.\u201d\nObara\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIf you were not my uncle\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am your uncle. And your prince. Swear, or go.\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d said Tyene. \u201cOn my father\u2019s grave.\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d said Lady Nym. \u201cBy Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper of Dorne, and a better man than you.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Obara. \u201cMe as well. By Father. I swear.\u201d\nSome of the tension went out of the prince. Hotah saw him sag back into his chair. He held out his hand, and Princess Arianne moved to his side to hold it. \u201cTell them, Father.\u201d\nPrince Doran took a jagged breath. \u201cDorne still has friends at court. Friends who tell us things we were not meant to know. This invitation Cersei sent us is a ruse. Trystane is never meant to reach King\u2019s Landing. On the road back, somewhere in the kingswood, Ser Balon\u2019s party will be attacked by outlaws, and my son will die. I am asked to court only so that I may witness this attack with my own eyes and thereby absolve the queen of any blame. Oh, and these outlaws? They will be shouting, \u2018Halfman, Halfman,\u2019 as they attack. Ser Balon may even catch a quick glimpse of the Imp, though no one else will.\u201d\nAreo Hotah would not have believed it possible to shock the Sand Snakes. He would have been wrong.\n\u201cSeven save us,\u201d whispered Tyene. \u201cTrystane? Why?\u201d\n\u201cThe woman must be mad,\u201d Obara said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a boy.\u201d\n\u201cThis is monstrous,\u201d said Lady Nym. \u201cI would not have believed it, not of a Kingsguard knight.\u201d\n\u201cThey are sworn to obey, just as my captain is,\u201d the prince said. \u201cI had my doubts as well, but you all saw how Ser Balon balked when I suggested that we go by sea. A ship would have disturbed all the queen\u2019s arrangements.\u201d\nObara\u2019s face was flushed. \u201cGive me back my spear, Uncle. Cersei sent us a head. We should send her back a bag of them.\u201d\nPrince Doran raised a hand. His knuckles were as dark as cherries and near as big. \u201cSer Balon is a guest beneath my roof. He has eaten of my bread and salt. I will not do him harm. No. We will travel to the Water Gardens, where he will hear Myrcella\u2019s story and send a raven to his queen. The girl will ask him to hunt down the man who hurt her. If he is the man I judge, Swann will not be able to refuse. Obara, you will lead him to High Hermitage to beard Darkstar in his den. The time is not yet come for Dorne to openly defy the Iron Throne, so we must needs return Myrcella to her mother, but I will not be accompanying her. That task will be yours, Nymeria. The Lannisters will not like it, no more than they liked it when I sent them Oberyn, but they dare not refuse. We need a voice in council, an ear at court. Be careful, though. King\u2019s Landing is a pit of snakes.\u201d\nLady Nym smiled. \u201cWhy, Uncle, I love snakes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of me?\u201d asked Tyene.\n\u201cYour mother was a septa. Oberyn once told me that she read to you in the cradle from the Seven-Pointed Star. I want you in King\u2019s Landing too, but on the other hill. The Swords and the Stars have been re-formed, and this new High Septon is not the puppet that the others were. Try and get close to him.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? White suits my coloring. I look so\u00a0\u2026\u00a0pure.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d the prince said, \u201cgood.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIf\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if certain things should come to pass, I will send word to each of you. Things can change quickly in the game of thrones.\u201d\n\u201cI know you will not fail us, cousins.\u201d Arianne went to each of them in turn, took their hands, kissed them lightly on the lips. \u201cObara, so fierce. Nymeria, my sister. Tyene, sweetling. I love you all. The sun of Dorne goes with you.\u201d\n\u201cUnbowed, unbent, unbroken,\u201d the Sand Snakes said, together.\nPrincess Arianne lingered when her cousins had departed. Areo Hotah remained as well, as was his place.\n\u201cThey are their father\u2019s daughters,\u201d the prince said.\nThe little princess smiled. \u201cThree Oberyns, with teats.\u201d\nPrince Doran laughed. It had been so long since Hotah last heard him laugh, he had almost forgotten what it sounded like.\n\u201cI still say it should be me who goes to King\u2019s Landing, not Lady Nym,\u201d Arianne said.\n\u201cIt is too dangerous. You are my heir, the future of Dorne. Your place is by my side. Soon enough, you\u2019ll have another task.\u201d\n\u201cThat last part, about the message. Have you had tidings?\u201d\nPrince Doran shared his secret smile with her. \u201cFrom Lys. A great fleet has put in there to take on water. Volantene ships chiefly, carrying an army. No word as to who they are, or where they might be bound. There was talk of elephants.\u201d\n\u201cNo dragons?\u201d\n\u201cElephants. Easy enough to hide a young dragon in a big cog\u2019s hold, though. Daenerys is most vulnerable at sea. If I were her, I would keep myself and my intentions hidden as long as I could, so I might take King\u2019s Landing unawares.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think that Quentyn will be with them?\u201d\n\u201cHe could be. Or not. We will know by where they land if Westeros is indeed their destination. Quentyn will bring her up the Greenblood if he can. But it does no good to speak of it. Kiss me. We leave for the Water Gardens at first light.\u201d\nWe may depart by midday, then, Hotah thought.\nLater, when Arianne had gone, he put down his longaxe and lifted Prince Doran into his bed. \u201cUntil the Mountain crushed my brother\u2019s skull, no Dornishmen had died in this War of the Five Kings,\u201d the prince murmured softly, as Hotah pulled a blanket over him. \u201cTell me, Captain, is that my shame or my glory?\u201d\n\u201cThat is not for me to say, my prince.\u201d Serve. Protect. Obey. Simple vows for simple men. That was all he knew.",

      "content": "JON\nVal waited by the gate in the predawn cold, wrapped up in a bearskin cloak so large it might well have fit Sam. Beside her was a garron, saddled and bridled, a shaggy grey with one white eye. Mully and Dolorous Edd stood with her, a pair of unlikely guards. Their breath frosted in the cold black air.\n\u201cYou gave her a blind horse?\u201d Jon said, incredulous.\n\u201cHe\u2019s only half-blind, m\u2019lord,\u201d offered Mully. \u201cElsewise he\u2019s sound enough.\u201d He patted the garron on the neck.\n\u201cThe horse may be half-blind, but I am not,\u201d said Val. \u201cI know where I must go.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady, you do not have to do this. The risk\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is mine, Lord Snow. And I am no southron lady but a woman of the free folk. I know the forest better than all your black-cloaked rangers. It holds no ghosts for me.\u201d\nI hope not. Jon was counting on that, trusting that Val could succeed where Black Jack Bulwer and his companions had failed. She need fear no harm from the free folk, he hoped\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but both of them knew too well that wildlings were not the only ones waiting in the woods. \u201cYou have sufficient food?\u201d\n\u201cHard bread, hard cheese, oat cakes, salt cod, salt beef, salt mutton, and a skin of sweet wine to rinse all that salt out of my mouth. I will not die of hunger.\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s time you were away.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my word, Lord Snow. I will return, with Tormund or without him.\u201d Val glanced at the sky. The moon was but half-full. \u201cLook for me on the first day of the full moon.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d Do not fail me, he thought, or Stannis will have my head. \u201cDo I have your word that you will keep our princess closely?\u201d the king had said, and Jon had promised that he would. Val is no princess, though. I told him that half a hundred times. It was a feeble sort of evasion, a sad rag wrapped around his wounded word. His father would never have approved. I am the sword that guards the realm of men, Jon reminded himself, and in the end, that must be worth more than one man\u2019s honor.\nThe road beneath the Wall was as dark and cold as the belly of an ice dragon and as twisty as a serpent. Dolorous Edd led them through with a torch in hand. Mully had the keys for the three gates, where bars of black iron as thick as a man\u2019s arm closed off the passage. Spearmen at each gate knuckled their foreheads at Jon Snow but stared openly at Val and her garron.\nWhen they emerged north of the Wall, through a thick door made of freshly hewn green wood, the wildling princess paused for a moment to gaze out across the snow-covered field where King Stannis had won his battle. Beyond, the haunted forest waited, dark and silent. The light of the half-moon turned Val\u2019s honey-blond hair a pale silver and left her cheeks as white as snow. She took a deep breath. \u201cThe air tastes sweet.\u201d\n\u201cMy tongue is too numb to tell. All I can taste is cold.\u201d\n\u201cCold?\u201d Val laughed lightly. \u201cNo. When it is cold it will hurt to breathe. When the Others come\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe thought was a disquieting one. Six of the rangers Jon had sent out were still missing. It is too soon. They may yet be back. But another part of him insisted, They are dead, every man of them. You sent them out to die, and you are doing the same to Val. \u201cTell Tormund what I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\u201cHe may not heed your words, but he will hear them.\u201d Val kissed him lightly on the cheek. \u201cYou have my thanks, Lord Snow. For the half-blind horse, the salt cod, the free air. For hope.\u201d\nTheir breath mingled, a white mist in the air. Jon Snow drew back and said, \u201cThe only thanks I want is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Tormund Giantsbane. Aye.\u201d Val pulled up the hood of her bearskin. The brown pelt was well salted with grey. \u201cBefore I go, one question. Did you kill Jarl, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall killed Jarl.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019d heard. But I had to be sure.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my word. I did not kill him.\u201d Though I might have if things had gone otherwise.\n\u201cThis is farewell, then,\u201d she said, almost playfully.\nJon Snow was in no mood for it. It is too cold and dark to play, and the hour is too late. \u201cOnly for a time. You will return. For the boy, if for no other reason.\u201d\n\u201cCraster\u2019s son?\u201d Val shrugged. \u201cHe is no kin to me.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard you singing to him.\u201d\n\u201cI was singing to myself. Am I to blame if he listens?\u201d A faint smile brushed her lips. \u201cIt makes him laugh. Oh, very well. He is a sweet little monster.\u201d\n\u201cMonster?\u201d\n\u201cHis milk name. I had to call him something. See that he stays safe and warm. For his mother\u2019s sake, and mine. And keep him away from the red woman. She knows who he is. She sees things in her fires.\u201d\nArya, he thought, hoping it was so. \u201cAshes and cinders.\u201d\n\u201cKings and dragons.\u201d\nDragons again. For a moment Jon could almost see them too, coiling in the night, their dark wings outlined against a sea of flame. \u201cIf she knew, she would have taken the boy away from us. Dalla\u2019s boy, not your monster. A word in the king\u2019s ear would have been the end of it.\u201d And of me. Stannis would have taken it for treason. \u201cWhy let it happen if she knew?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it suited her. Fire is a fickle thing. No one knows which way a flame will go.\u201d Val put a foot into a stirrup, swung her leg over her horse\u2019s back, and looked down from the saddle. \u201cDo you remember what my sister told you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d A sword without a hilt, with no safe way to hold it. But Melisandre had the right of it. Even a sword without a hilt is better than an empty hand when foes are all around you.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Val wheeled the garron toward the north. \u201cThe first night of the full moon, then.\u201d Jon watched her ride away wondering if he would ever see her face again. I am no southron lady, he could hear her say, but a woman of the free folk.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what she says,\u201d muttered Dolorous Edd, as Val vanished behind a stand of soldier pines. \u201cThe air is so cold it hurts to breathe. I would stop, but that would hurt worse.\u201d He rubbed his hands together. \u201cThis is going to end badly.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that of everything.\u201d\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord. Usually I\u2019m right.\u201d\nMully cleared his throat. \u201cM\u2019lord? The wildling princess, letting her go, the men may say\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014that I am half a wildling myself, a turncloak who means to sell the realm to our raiders, cannibals, and giants.\u201d Jon did not need to stare into a fire to know what was being said of him. The worst part was, they were not wrong, not wholly. \u201cWords are wind, and the wind is always blowing at the Wall. Come.\u201d\nIt was still dark when Jon returned to his chambers behind the armory. Ghost was not yet back, he saw. Still hunting. The big white direwolf was gone more oft than not of late, ranging farther and farther in search of prey. Between the men of the Watch and the wildlings down in Mole\u2019s Town, the hills and fields near Castle Black had been hunted clean, and there had been little enough game to begin with. Winter is coming, Jon reflected. And soon, too soon. He wondered if they would ever see a spring.\nDolorous Edd made the trek to the kitchens and soon was back with a tankard of brown ale and a covered platter. Under the lid Jon discovered three duck\u2019s eggs fried in drippings, a strip of bacon, two sausages, a blood pudding, and half a loaf of bread still warm from the oven. He ate the bread and half an egg. He would have eaten the bacon too, but the raven made off with it before he had the chance. \u201cThief,\u201d Jon said, as the bird flapped up to the lintel above the door to devour its prize.\n\u201cThief,\u201d the raven agreed.\nJon tried a bite of sausage. He was washing the taste from his mouth with a sip of ale when Edd returned to tell him Bowen Marsh was without. \u201cOthell\u2019s with him, and Septon Cellador.\u201d\nThat was quick. He wondered who was telling tales and if there was more than one. \u201cSend them in.\u201d\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord. You\u2019ll want to watch your sausages with this lot, though. They have a hungry look about them.\u201d\nHungry was not the word Jon would have used. Septon Cellador appeared confused and groggy and in dire need of some scales from the dragon that had flamed him, whilst First Builder Othell Yarwyck looked as if he had swallowed something he could not quite digest. Bowen Marsh was angry. Jon could see it in his eyes, the tightness around his mouth, the flush to those round cheeks. That red is not from cold. \u201cPlease sit,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I offer you food or drink?\u201d\n\u201cWe broke our fast in the commons,\u201d said Marsh.\n\u201cI could do with more.\u201d Yarwyck eased himself down onto a chair. \u201cGood of you to offer.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps some wine?\u201d said Septon Cellador.\n\u201cCorn,\u201d screamed the raven from the lintel. \u201cCorn, corn.\u201d\n\u201cWine for the septon and a plate for our First Builder,\u201d Jon told Dolorous Edd. \u201cNothing for the bird.\u201d He turned back to his visitors. \u201cYou\u2019re here about Val.\u201d\n\u201cAnd other matters,\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cThe men have concerns, my lord.\u201d\nAnd who is it who appointed you to speak for them? \u201cAs do I. Othell, how goes the work at the Nightfort? I have had a letter from Ser Axell Florent, who styles himself the Queen\u2019s Hand. He tells me that Queen Selyse is not pleased with her quarters at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and wishes to move into her husband\u2019s new seat at once. Will that be possible?\u201d\nYarwyck shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve got most of the keep restored and put a roof back on the kitchens. She\u2019d need food and furnishings and firewood, mind you, but it might serve. Not so many comforts as Eastwatch, to be sure. And a long way from the ships, should Her Grace wish to leave us, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0aye, she could live there, though it will be years before the place looks a proper castle. Sooner if I had more builders.\u201d\n\u201cI could offer you a giant.\u201d\nThat gave Othell a start. \u201cThe monster in the yard?\u201d\n\u201cHis name is Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun, Leathers tells me. A lot to wrap a tongue around, I know. Leathers calls him Wun Wun, and that seems to serve.\u201d Wun Wun was very little like the giants in Old Nan\u2019s tales, those huge savage creatures who mixed blood into their morning porridge and devoured whole bulls, hair and hide and horns. This giant ate no meat at all, though he was a holy terror when served a basket of roots, crunching onions and turnips and even raw hard neeps between his big square teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s a willing worker, though getting him to understand what you want is not always easy. He speaks the Old Tongue after a fashion, but nothing of the Common. Tireless, though, and his strength is prodigious. He could do the work of a dozen men.\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my lord, the men would never\u00a0\u2026\u00a0giants eat human flesh, I think\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no, my lord, I thank you, but I do not have the men to watch over such a creature, he\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nJon Snow was unsurprised. \u201cAs you wish. We will keep the giant here.\u201d Truth be told, he would have been loath to part with Wun Wun. You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte might say, but Jon spoke with the giant whenever he could, through Leathers or one of the free folk they had brought back from the grove, and was learning much and more about his people and their history. He only wished that Sam were here to write the stories down.\nThat was not to say that he was blind to the danger Wun Wun represented. The giant would lash out violently when threatened, and those huge hands were strong enough to rip a man apart. He reminded Jon of Hodor. Hodor twice as big, twice as strong, and half as clever. There\u2019s a thought to sober even Septon Cellador. But if Tormund has giants with him, Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun may help us treat with them.\nMormont\u2019s raven muttered his annoyance as the door opened beneath him, heralding the return of Dolorous Edd with a flagon of wine and a plate of eggs and sausages. Bowen Marsh waited with obvious impatience as Edd poured, resuming only when he left again. \u201cTollett is a good man, and well liked, and Iron Emmett has been a fine master-at-arms,\u201d he said then. \u201cYet the talk is that you mean to send them away.\u201d\n\u201cWe need good men at Long Barrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhore\u2019s Hole, the men have started calling it,\u201d said Marsh, \u201cbut be that as it may. Is it true that you mean to replace Emmett with this savage Leathers as our master-at-arms? That is an office most oft reserved for knights, or rangers at the least.\u201d\n\u201cLeathers is savage,\u201d Jon agreed mildly. \u201cI can attest to that. I\u2019ve tried him in the practice yard. He\u2019s as dangerous with a stone axe as most knights are with castle-forged steel. I grant you, he is not as patient as I\u2019d like, and some of the boys are terrified of him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but that\u2019s not all for the bad. One day they\u2019ll find themselves in a real fight, and a certain familiarity with terror will serve them well.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wildling.\u201d\n\u201cHe was, until he said the words. Now he is our brother. One who can teach the boys more than swordcraft. It would not hurt them to learn a few words of the Old Tongue and something of the ways of the free folk.\u201d\n\u201cFree,\u201d the raven muttered. \u201cCorn. King.\u201d\n\u201cThe men do not trust him.\u201d\nWhich men? Jon might have asked. How many? But that would lead him down a road he did not mean to ride. \u201cI am sorry to hear that. Is there more?\u201d\nSepton Cellador spoke up. \u201cThis boy Satin. It\u2019s said you mean to make him your steward and squire, in Tollett\u2019s place. My lord, the boy\u2019s a whore\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0dare I say\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a painted catamite from the brothels of Oldtown.\u201d\nAnd you are a drunk. \u201cWhat he was in Oldtown is none of our concern. He\u2019s quick to learn and very clever. The other recruits started out despising him, but he won them over and made friends of them all. He\u2019s fearless in a fight and can even read and write after a fashion. He should be capable of fetching me my meals and saddling my horse, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cMost like,\u201d said Bowen Marsh, stony-faced, \u201cbut the men do not like it. Traditionally the lord commander\u2019s squires are lads of good birth being groomed for command. Does my lord believe the men of the Night\u2019s Watch would ever follow a whore into battle?\u201d\nJon\u2019s temper flashed. \u201cThey have followed worse. The Old Bear left a few cautionary notes about certain of the men, for his successor. We have a cook at the Shadow Tower who was fond of raping septas. He burned a seven-pointed star into his flesh for every one he claimed. His left arm is stars from wrist to elbow, and stars mark his calves as well. At Eastwatch we have a man who set his father\u2019s house afire and barred the door. His entire family burned to death, all nine. Whatever Satin may have done in Oldtown, he is our brother now, and he will be my squire.\u201d\nSepton Cellador drank some wine. Othell Yarwyck stabbed a sausage with his dagger. Bower Marsh sat red-faced. The raven flapped its wings and said, \u201cCorn, corn, kill.\u201d Finally the Lord Steward cleared his throat. \u201cYour lordship knows best, I am sure. Might I ask about these corpses in the ice cells? They make the men uneasy. And to keep them under guard? Surely that is a waste of two good men, unless you fear that they\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0will rise? I pray they do.\u201d\nSepton Cellador paled. \u201cSeven save us.\u201d Wine dribbled down his chin in a red line. \u201cLord Commander, wights are monstrous, unnatural creatures. Abominations before the eyes of the gods. You\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you cannot mean to try to talk with them?\u201d\n\u201cCan they talk?\u201d asked Jon Snow. \u201cI think not, but I cannot claim to know. Monsters they may be, but they were men before they died. How much remains? The one I slew was intent on killing Lord Commander Mormont. Plainly it remembered who he was and where to find him.\u201d Maester Aemon would have grasped his purpose, Jon did not doubt; Sam Tarly would have been terrified, but he would have understood as well. \u201cMy lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. We understand little of the wights and less about the Others. We need to learn.\u201d\nThat answer did not please them. Septon Cellador fingered the crystal that hung about his neck and said, \u201cI think this most unwise, Lord Snow. I shall pray to the Crone to lift her shining lamp and lead you down the path of wisdom.\u201d\nJon Snow\u2019s patience was exhausted. \u201cWe could all do with a bit more wisdom, I am sure.\u201d You know nothing, Jon Snow. \u201cNow, shall we speak of Val?\u201d\n\u201cIt is true, then?\u201d said Marsh. \u201cYou have released her.\u201d\n\u201cBeyond the Wall.\u201d\nSepton Cellador sucked in his breath. \u201cThe king\u2019s prize. His Grace will be most wroth to find her gone.\u201d\n\u201cVal will return.\u201d Before Stannis, if the gods are good.\n\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d demanded Bowen Marsh.\n\u201cShe said she would.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if she lied? If she meets with misadventure?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, then, you may have a chance to choose a lord commander more to your liking. Until such time, I fear you\u2019ll still need to suffer me.\u201d Jon took a swallow of ale. \u201cI sent her to find Tormund Giantsbane and bring him my offer.\u201d\n\u201cIf we may know, what offer is this?\u201d\n\u201cThe same offer I made at Mole\u2019s Town. Food and shelter and peace, if he will join his strength to ours, fight our common enemy, help us hold the Wall.\u201d\nBowen Marsh did not appear surprised. \u201cYou mean to let him pass.\u201d His voice suggested he had known all along. \u201cTo open the gates for him and his followers. Hundreds, thousands.\u201d\n\u201cIf he has that many left.\u201d\nSepton Cellador made the sign of the star. Othell Yarwyck grunted. Bowen Marsh said, \u201cSome might call this treason. These are wildlings. Savages, raiders, rapers, more beast than man.\u201d\n\u201cTormund is none of those things,\u201d said Jon, \u201cno more than Mance Rayder. But even if every word you said was true, they are still men, Bowen. Living men, human as you and me. Winter is coming, my lords, and when it does, we living men will need to stand together against the dead.\u201d\n\u201cSnow,\u201d screamed Lord Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cSnow, Snow.\u201d\nJon ignored him. \u201cWe have been questioning the wildlings we brought back from the grove. Several of them told an interesting tale, of a woods witch called Mother Mole.\u201d\n\u201cMother Mole?\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cAn unlikely name.\u201d\n\u201cSupposedly she made her home in a burrow beneath a hollow tree. Whatever the truth of that, she had a vision of a fleet of ships arriving to carry the free folk to safety across the narrow sea. Thousands of those who fled the battle were desperate enough to believe her. Mother Mole has led them all to Hardhome, there to pray and await salvation from across the sea.\u201d\nOthell Yarwyck scowled. \u201cI\u2019m no ranger, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Hardhome is an unholy place, it\u2019s said. Cursed. Even your uncle used to say as much, Lord Snow. Why would they go there?\u201d\nJon had a map before him on the table. He turned it so they could see. \u201cHardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has a natural harbor deep enough for the biggest ships afloat. Wood and stone are plentiful near there. The waters teem with fish, and there are colonies of seals and sea cows close at hand.\u201d\n\u201cAll that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t doubt,\u201d said Yarwyck, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a place I\u2019d want to spend a night. You know the tale.\u201d\nHe did. Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north. Afterward ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.\nSix centuries had come and gone since that night, but Hardhome was still shunned. The wild had reclaimed the site, Jon had been told, but rangers claimed that the overgrown ruins were haunted by ghouls and demons and burning ghosts with an unhealthy taste for blood. \u201cIt is not the sort of refuge I\u2019d chose either,\u201d Jon said, \u201cbut Mother Mole was heard to preach that the free folk would find salvation where once they found damnation.\u201d\nSepton Cellador pursed his lips. \u201cSalvation can be found only through the Seven. This witch has doomed them all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd saved the Wall, mayhaps,\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cThese are enemies we speak of. Let them pray amongst the ruins, and if their gods send ships to carry them off to a better world, well and good. In this world I have no food to feed them.\u201d\nJon flexed the fingers of his sword hand. \u201cCotter Pyke\u2019s galleys sail past Hardhome from time to time. He tells me there is no shelter there but the caves. The screaming caves, his men call them. Mother Mole and those who followed her will perish there, of cold and starvation. Hundreds of them. Thousands.\u201d\n\u201cThousands of enemies. Thousands of wildlings.\u201d\nThousands of people, Jon thought. Men, women, children. Anger rose inside him, but when he spoke his voice was quiet and cold. \u201cAre you so blind, or is it that you do not wish to see? What do you think will happen when all these enemies are dead?\u201d\nAbove the door the raven muttered, \u201cDead, dead, dead.\u201d\n\u201cLet me tell you what will happen,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThe dead will rise again, in their hundreds and their thousands. They will rise as wights, with black hands and pale blue eyes, and they will come for us.\u201d He pushed himself to his feet, the fingers of his sword hand opening and closing. \u201cYou have my leave to go.\u201d\nSepton Cellador rose grey-faced and sweating, Othell Yarwyck stiffly, Bowen Marsh tight-lipped and pale. \u201cThank you for your time, Lord Snow.\u201d They left without another word.",

      "content": "TYRION\nThe sow had a sweeter temper than some horses he had ridden.\nPatient and sure-footed, she accepted Tyrion with hardly a squeal when he clambered onto her back, and remained motionless as he reached for shield and lance. Yet when he gathered up her reins and pressed his feet into her side, she moved at once. Her name was Pretty, short for Pretty Pig, and she had been trained to saddle and bridle since she was a piglet.\nThe painted wooden armor clattered as Pretty trotted across the deck. Tyrion\u2019s armpits were prickly with perspiration, and a bead of sweat was trickling down his scar beneath the oversized, ill-fitting helm, yet for one absurd moment he felt almost like Jaime, riding out onto a tourney field with lance in hand, his golden armor flashing in the sun.\nWhen the laughter began, the dream dissolved. He was no champion, just a dwarf on a pig clutching a stick, capering for the amusement of some restless rum-soaked sailors in hopes of sweetening their mood. Somewhere down in hell his father was seething and Joffrey was chuckling. Tyrion could feel their cold dead eyes watching this mummer\u2019s face, as avid as the crew of the Selaesori Qhoran.\nAnd now here came his foe. Penny rode her big grey dog, her striped lance waving drunkenly as the beast bounded across the deck. Her shield and armor had been painted red, though the paint was chipped and fading; his own armor was blue. Not mine. Groat\u2019s. Never mine, I pray.\nTyrion kicked at Pretty\u2019s haunches to speed her to a charge as the sailors urged him on with hoots and shouts. Whether they were shouting encouragement or mocking him he could not have said for certain, though he had a fair notion. Why did I ever allow myself to be talked into this farce?\nHe knew the answer, though. For twelve days now the ship had floated becalmed in the Gulf of Grief. The mood of the crew was ugly, and like to turn uglier when their daily rum ration went dry. There were only so many hours a man could devote to mending sails, caulking leaks, and fishing. Jorah Mormont had heard the muttering about how dwarf luck had failed them. Whilst the ship\u2019s cook still gave Tyrion\u2019s head a rub from time to time, in hopes that it might stir a wind, the rest had taken to giving him venomous looks whenever he crossed their paths. Penny\u2019s lot was even worse, since the cook had put about the notion that squeezing a dwarf girl\u2019s breast might be just the thing to win their luck back. He had also started referring to Pretty Pig as Bacon, a jape that had seemed much funnier when Tyrion had made it.\n\u201cWe have to make them laugh,\u201d Penny had said, pleading. \u201cWe have to make them like us. If we give them a show, it will help them forget. Please, m\u2019lord.\u201d And somehow, somewise, someway he had consented. It must have been the rum. The captain\u2019s wine had been the first thing to run out. You could get drunk much quicker on rum than on wine, Tyrion Lannister had discovered.\nSo he found himself clad in Groat\u2019s painted wooden armor, astride Groat\u2019s sow, whilst Groat\u2019s sister instructed him in the finer points of the mummer\u2019s joust that had been their bread and salt. It had a certain delicious irony to it, considering that Tyrion had almost lost his head once by refusing to mount the dog for his nephew\u2019s twisted amusement. Yet somehow he found it difficult to appreciate the humor of it all from sowback.\nPenny\u2019s lance descended just in time for its blunted point to brush his shoulder; his own lance wobbled as he brought it down and banged it noisily off a corner of her shield. She kept her seat. He lost his. But then, he was supposed to.\nEasy as falling off a pig\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though falling off this particular pig was harder than it looked. Tyrion curled into a ball as he dropped, remembering his lesson, but even so, he hit the deck with a solid thump and bit his tongue so hard he tasted blood. He felt as if he were twelve again, cartwheeling across the supper table in Casterly Rock\u2019s great hall. Back then his uncle Gerion had been on hand to praise his efforts, in place of surly sailors. Their laughter seemed sparse and strained compared to the great gales that had greeted Groat\u2019s and Penny\u2019s antics at Joffrey\u2019s wedding feast, and some hissed at him in anger. \u201cNo-Nose, you ride same way you look, ugly,\u201d one man shouted from the sterncastle. \u201cMust have no balls, let girl beat you.\u201d He wagered coin on me, Tyrion decided. He let the insult wash right over him. He had heard worse in his time.\nThe wooden armor made rising awkward. He found himself flailing like a turtle on its back. That, at least, set a few of the sailors to laughing. A shame I did not break my leg, that would have left them howling. And if they had been in that privy when I shot my father through the bowels, they might have laughed hard enough to shit their breeches right along with him. But anything to keep the bloody bastards sweet.\nJorah Mormont finally took pity on Tyrion\u2019s struggles and pulled him to his feet. \u201cYou looked a fool.\u201d\nThat was the intent. \u201cIt is hard to look a hero when mounted on a pig.\u201d\n\u201cThat must be why I stay off pigs.\u201d\nTyrion unbuckled his helm, twisted it off, and spat a gobbet of bloody pink phlegm over the side. \u201cIt feels as though I bit through half my tongue.\u201d\n\u201cNext time bite harder.\u201d Ser Jorah shrugged. \u201cTruth be told, I\u2019ve seen worse jousters.\u201d\nWas that praise? \u201cI fell off the bloody pig and bit my tongue. What could possibly be worse than that?\u201d\n\u201cGetting a splinter through your eye and dying.\u201d\nPenny had vaulted off her dog, a big grey brute called Crunch. \u201cThe thing is not to joust well, Hugor.\u201d She was always careful to call him Hugor where anyone might hear. \u201cThe thing is to make them laugh and throw coins.\u201d\nPoor payment for the blood and bruises, Tyrion thought, but he kept that to himself as well. \u201cWe failed at that as well. No one threw coins.\u201d Not a penny, not a groat.\n\u201cThey will when we get better.\u201d Penny pulled off her helm. Mouse-brown hair spilled down to her ears. Her eyes were brown too, beneath a heavy shelf of brow, her cheeks smooth and flushed. She pulled some acorns from a leather bag for Pretty Pig. The sow ate them from her hand, squealing happily. \u201cWhen we perform for Queen Daenerys the silver will rain down, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\nSome of the sailors were shouting at them and slamming their heels against the deck, demanding another tilt. The ship\u2019s cook was the loudest, as always. Tyrion had learned to despise that man, even if he was the only half-decent cyvasse player on the cog. \u201cYou see, they liked us,\u201d Penny said, with a hopeful little smile. \u201cShall we go again, Hugor?\u201d\nHe was on the point of refusing when a shout from one of the mates spared him the necessity. It was midmorning, and the captain wanted the boats out again. The cog\u2019s huge striped sail hung limply from her mast, as it had for days, but he was hopeful that they could find a wind somewhere to the north. That meant rowing. The boats were small, however, and the cog was large; towing it was hot, sweaty, exhausting work that left the hands blistered and the back aching, and accomplished nothing. The crew hated it. Tyrion could not blame them. \u201cThe widow should have put us on a galley,\u201d he muttered sourly. \u201cIf someone could help me out of these bloody planks, I would be grateful. I think I may have a splinter through my crotch.\u201d\nMormont did the duty, albeit with poor grace. Penny collected her dog and pig and led them both below. \u201cYou might want to tell your lady to keep her door closed and barred when she\u2019s inside,\u201d Ser Jorah said as he was undoing the buckles on the straps that joined the wooden breastplate to the backplate. \u201cI\u2019m hearing too much talk about ribs and hams and bacon.\u201d\n\u201cThat pig is half her livelihood.\u201d\n\u201cA Ghiscari crew would eat the dog as well.\u201d Mormont pulled the breastplate and backplate apart. \u201cJust tell her.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d His tunic was soaked with sweat and clinging to his chest. Tyrion plucked at it, wishing for a bit of breeze. The wooden armor was as hot and heavy as it was uncomfortable. Half of it looked to be old paint, layer on layer on layer of it, from a hundred past repaintings. At Joffrey\u2019s wedding feast, he recalled, one rider had displayed the direwolf of Robb Stark, the other the arms and colors of Stannis Baratheon. \u201cWe will need both animals if we\u2019re to tilt for Queen Daenerys,\u201d he said. If the sailors took it in their heads to butcher Pretty Pig, neither he nor Penny could hope to stop them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Ser Jorah\u2019s longsword might give them pause, at least.\n\u201cIs that how you hope to keep your head, Imp?\u201d\n\u201cSer Imp, if you please. And yes. Once Her Grace knows my true worth, she\u2019ll cherish me. I am a lovable little fellow, after all, and I know many useful things about my kin. But until such time I had best keep her amused.\u201d\n\u201cCaper as you like, it won\u2019t wash out your crimes. Daenerys Targaryen is no silly child to be diverted by japes and tumbles. She will deal with you justly.\u201d\nOh, I hope not. Tyrion studied Mormont with his mismatched eyes. \u201cAnd how will she welcome you, this just queen? A warm embrace, a girlish titter, a headsman\u2019s axe?\u201d He grinned at the knight\u2019s obvious discomfit. \u201cDid you truly expect me to believe you were about the queen\u2019s business in that whorehouse? Defending her from half a world away? Or could it be that you were running, that your dragon queen sent you from her side? But why would she\u00a0\u2026\u00a0oh, wait, you were spying on her.\u201d Tyrion made a clucking sound. \u201cYou hope to buy your way back into her favor by presenting her with me. An ill-considered scheme, I\u2019d say. One might even say an act of drunken desperation. Perhaps if I were Jaime\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Jaime killed her father, I only killed my own. You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you, but the reverse is just as likely. Maybe you should hop up on that pig, Ser Jorah. Put on a suit of iron motley, like Florian the\u2014\u201d\nThe blow the big knight gave him cracked his head around and knocked him sideways, so hard that his head bounced off the deck. Blood filled his mouth as he staggered back onto one knee. He spat out a broken tooth. Growing prettier every day, but I do believe I poked a wound. \u201cDid the dwarf say something to offend you, ser?\u201d Tyrion asked innocently, wiping bubbles of blood off his broken lip with the back of his hand.\n\u201cI am sick of your mouth, dwarf,\u201d said Mormont. \u201cYou still have a few teeth left. If you want to keep them, stay away from me for the rest of this voyage.\u201d\n\u201cThat could be difficult. We share a cabin.\u201d\n\u201cYou can find somewhere else to sleep. Down in the hold, up on deck, it makes no matter. Just keep out of my sight.\u201d\nTyrion pulled himself back to his feet. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he answered, through a mouthful of blood, but the big knight was already gone, his boots pounding on the deckboards.\nBelow, in the galley, Tyrion was rinsing out his mouth with rum and water and wincing at the sting when Penny found him. \u201cI heard what happened. Oh, are you hurt?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cA bit of blood and a broken tooth.\u201d But I believe I hurt him more. \u201cAnd him a knight. Sad to say, I would not count on Ser Jorah should we need protection.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do? Oh, your lip is bleeding.\u201d She slipped a square from her sleeve and dabbed at it. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cA few truths Ser Bezoar did not care to hear.\u201d\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t mock him. Don\u2019t you know anything? You can\u2019t talk that way to a big person. They can hurt you. Ser Jorah could have tossed you in the sea. The sailors would have laughed to see you drown. You have to be careful around big people. Be jolly and playful with them, keep them smiling, make them laugh, that\u2019s what my father always said. Didn\u2019t your father ever tell you how to act with big people?\u201d\n\u201cMy father called them smallfolk,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cand he was not what you\u2019d call a jolly man.\u201d He took another sip of watered rum, sloshed it around his mouth, spat it out. \u201cStill, I take your point. I have a deal to learn about being a dwarf. Perhaps you will be good enough to teach me, in between the jousting and the pig-riding.\u201d\n\u201cI will, m\u2019lord. Gladly. But\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what were these truths? Why did Ser Jorah hit you so hard?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, for love. The same reason that I stewed that singer.\u201d He thought of Shae and the look in her eyes as he tightened the chain about her throat, twisting it in his fist. A chain of golden hands. For hands of gold are always gold, but a woman\u2019s hands are warm. \u201cAre you a maid, Penny?\u201d\nShe blushed. \u201cYes. Of course. Who would have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStay that way. Love is madness, and lust is poison. Keep your maidenhead. You\u2019ll be happier for it, and you\u2019re less like to find yourself in some dingy brothel on the Rhoyne with a whore who looks a bit like your lost love.\u201d Or chasing across half the world, hoping to find wherever whores go. \u201cSer Jorah dreams of rescuing his dragon queen and basking in her gratitude, but I know a thing or two about the gratitude of kings, and I\u2019d sooner have a palace in Valyria.\u201d He broke off suddenly. \u201cDid you feel that? The ship moved.\u201d\n\u201cIt did.\u201d Penny\u2019s face lit up with joy. \u201cWe\u2019re moving again. The wind\u00a0\u2026\u201d She rushed to the door. \u201cI want to see. Come, I\u2019ll race you up.\u201d Off she went.\nShe is young, Tyrion had to remind himself, as Penny scrambled from the galley and up the steep wooden steps as fast as her short legs would allow. Almost a child. Still, it tickled him to see her excitement. He followed her topside.\nThe sail had come to life again, billowing, emptying, then billowing again, the red stripes on the canvas wriggling like snakes. Sailors dashed across the decks and hauled on lines as the mates bellowed orders in the tongue of Old Volantis. The rowers in the ship\u2019s boats had loosed their tow ropes and turned back toward the cog, stroking hard. The wind was blowing from the west, swirling and gusting, clutching at ropes and cloaks like a mischievous child. The Selaesori Qhoran was under way.\nMight be we\u2019ll make Meereen after all, Tyrion thought.\nBut when he clambered up the ladder to the sterncastle and looked off from the stern, his smile faltered. Blue sky and blue sea here, but off west\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have never seen a sky that color. A thick band of clouds ran along the horizon. \u201cA bar sinister,\u201d he said to Penny, pointing.\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cIt means some big bastard is creeping up behind us.\u201d\nHe was surprised to find that Moqorro and two of his fiery fingers had joined them on the sterncastle. It was only midday, and the red priest and his men did not normally emerge till dusk. The priest gave him a solemn nod. \u201cThere you see it, Hugor Hill. God\u2019s wroth. The Lord of Light will not be mocked.\u201d\nTyrion had a bad feeling about this. \u201cThe widow said this ship would never reach her destination. I took that to mean that once we were out to sea beyond the reach of triarchs, the captain would change course for Meereen. Or perhaps that you would seize the ship with your Fiery Hand and take us to Daenerys. But that isn\u2019t what your high priest saw at all, is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Moqorro\u2019s deep voice tolled as solemnly as a funeral bell. \u201cThis is what he saw.\u201d The red priest lifted his staff, and inclined its head toward the west.\nPenny was lost. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What does it mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt means we had best get below. Ser Jorah has exiled me from our cabin. Might I hide in yours when the time comes?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would be\u00a0\u2026\u00a0oh\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nFor the better part of three hours they ran before the wind, as the storm grew closer. The western sky went green, then grey, then black. A wall of dark clouds loomed up behind them, churning like a kettle of milk left on the fire too long. Tyrion and Penny watched from the forecastle, huddled by the figurehead and holding hands, careful to stay out of the way of captain and crew.\nThe last storm had been thrilling, intoxicating, a sudden squall that had left him feeling cleansed and refreshed. This one felt different right from the first. The captain sensed it too. He changed their course to north by northeast to try and get out of the storm\u2019s path.\nIt was a futile effort. This storm was too big. The seas around them grew rougher. The wind began to howl. The Stinky Steward rose and fell as waves smashed against her hull. Behind them lightning stabbed down from the sky, blinding purple bolts that danced across the sea in webs of light. Thunder followed. \u201cThe time has come to hide.\u201d Tyrion took Penny by the arm and led her belowdecks.\nPretty and Crunch were were both half-mad with fear. The dog was barking, barking, barking. He knocked Tyrion right off his feet as they entered. The sow had been shitting everywhere. Tyrion cleaned that up as best he could whilst Penny tried to calm the animals. Then they tied down or put away anything that was still loose. \u201cI\u2019m frightened,\u201d Penny confessed. The cabin had begun to tilt and jump, going this way and that as the waves hammered at the hull of the ship.\nThere are worse ways to die than drowning. Your brother learned that, and so did my lord father. And Shae, that lying cunt. Hands of gold are always cold, but a woman\u2019s hands are warm. \u201cWe should play a game,\u201d Tyrion suggested. \u201cThat might help take our thoughts off the storm.\u201d\n\u201cNot cyvasse,\u201d she said at once.\n\u201cNot cyvasse,\u201d Tyrion agreed, as the deck rose under him. That would only lead to pieces flying violently across the cabin and raining down on sow and dog. \u201cWhen you were a little girl, did you ever play come-into-my-castle?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Can you teach me?\u201d\nCould he? Tyrion hesitated. Fool of a dwarf. Of course she\u2019s never played come-into-my-castle. She never had a castle. Come-into-my-castle was a game for highborn children, one meant to teach them courtesy, heraldry, and a thing or two about their lord father\u2019s friends and foes. \u201cThat won\u2019t\u00a0\u2026\u201d he started. The deck gave another violent heave, slamming the two of them together. Penny gave a squeak of fright. \u201cThat game won\u2019t do,\u201d Tyrion told her, gritting his teeth. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know what game\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Penny kissed him.\nIt was an awkward kiss, rushed, clumsy. But it took him utterly by surprise. His hands jerked up and grabbed hold of her shoulders to shove her away. Instead he hesitated, then pulled her closer, gave her a squeeze. Her lips were dry, hard, closed up tighter than a miser\u2019s purse. A small mercy, thought Tyrion. This was nothing he had wanted. He liked Penny, he pitied Penny, he even admired Penny in a way, but he did not desire her. He had no wish to hurt her, though; the gods and his sweet sister had given her enough pain. So he let the kiss go on, holding her gently by the shoulders. His own lips stayed firmly shut. The Selaesori Qhoran rolled and shuddered around them.\nFinally she pulled back an inch or two. Tyrion could see his own reflection shining in her eyes. Pretty eyes, he thought, but he saw other things as well. A lot of fear, a little hope\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not a bit of lust. She does not want me, no more than I want her.\nWhen she lowered her head, he took her under the chin and raised it up again. \u201cWe cannot play that game, my lady.\u201d Above the thunder boomed, close at hand now.\n\u201cI never meant\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I never kissed a boy before, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I only thought, what if we drown, and I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt was sweet,\u201d lied Tyrion, \u201cbut I am married. She was with me at the feast, you may remember her. Lady Sansa.\u201d\n\u201cWas she your wife? She\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she was very beautiful\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nAnd false. Sansa, Shae, all my women\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Tysha was the only one who ever loved me. Where do whores go? \u201cA lovely girl,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cand we were joined beneath the eyes of gods and men. It may be that she is lost to me, but until I know that for a certainty I must be true to her.\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Penny turned her face away from his.\nMy perfect woman, Tyrion thought bitterly. One still young enough to believe such blatant lies.\nThe hull was creaking, the deck moving, and Pretty was squealing in distress. Penny crawled across the cabin floor on her hands and knees, wrapped her arms around the sow\u2019s head, and murmured reassurance to her. Looking at the two of them, it was hard to know who was comforting whom. The sight was so grotesque it should have been hilarious, but Tyrion could not even find a smile. The girl deserves better than a pig, he thought. An honest kiss, a little kindness, everyone deserves that much, however big or small. He looked about for his wine cup, but when he found it all the rum had spilled. Drowning is bad enough, he reflected sourly, but drowning sad and sober, that\u2019s too cruel.\nIn the end, they did not drown\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though there were times when the prospect of a nice, peaceful drowning had a certain appeal. The storm raged for the rest of that day and well into the night. Wet winds howled around them and waves rose like the fists of drowned giants to smash down on their decks. Above, they learned later, a mate and two sailors were swept overboard, the ship\u2019s cook was blinded when a kettle of hot grease flew up into his face, and the captain was thrown from the sterncastle to the main deck so violently he broke both legs. Below, Crunch howled and barked and snapped at Penny, and Pretty Pig began to shit again, turning the cramped, damp cabin into a sty. Tyrion managed to avoid retching his way through all of this, chiefly thanks to the lack of wine. Penny was not so fortunate, but he held her anyway as the ship\u2019s hull creaked and groaned alarmingly around them, like a cask about to burst.\nNearby midnight the winds finally died away, and the sea grew calm enough for Tyrion to make his way back up onto deck. What he saw there did not reassure him. The cog was drifting on a sea of dragonglass beneath a bowl of stars, but all around the storm raged on. East, west, north, south, everywhere he looked, the clouds rose up like black mountains, their tumbled slopes and collossal cliffs alive with blue and purple lightning. No rain was falling, but the decks were slick and wet underfoot.\nTyrion could hear someone screaming from below, a thin, high voice hysterical with fear. He could hear Moqorro too. The red priest stood on the forecastle facing the storm, his staff raised above his head as he boomed a prayer. Amidships, a dozen sailors and two of the fiery fingers were struggling with tangled lines and sodden canvas, but whether they were trying to raise the sail again or pull it down he never knew. Whatever they were doing, it seemed to him a very bad idea. And so it was.\nThe wind returned as a whispered threat, cold and damp, brushing over his cheek, flapping the wet sail, swirling and tugging at Moqorro\u2019s scarlet robes. Some instinct made Tyrion grab hold of the nearest rail, just in time. In the space of three heartbeats the little breeze became a howling gale. Moqorro shouted something, and green flames leapt from the dragon\u2019s maw atop his staff to vanish in the night. Then the rains came, black and blinding, and forecastle and sterncastle both vanished behind a wall of water. Something huge flapped overhead, and Tyrion glanced up in time to see the sail taking wing, with two men still dangling from the lines. Then he heard a crack. Oh, bloody hell, he had time to think, that had to be the mast.\nHe found a line and pulled on it, fighting toward the hatch to get himself below out of the storm, but a gust of wind knocked his feet from under him and a second slammed him into the rail and there he clung. Rain lashed at his face, blinding him. His mouth was full of blood again. The ship groaned and growled beneath him like a constipated fat man straining to shit.\nThen the mast burst.\nTyrion never saw it, but he heard it. That cracking sound again and then a scream of tortured wood, and suddenly the air was full of shards and splinters. One missed his eye by half an inch, a second found his neck, a third went through his calf, boots and breeches and all. He screamed. But he held on to the line, held on with a desperate strength he did not know he had. The widow said this ship would never reach her destination, he remembered. Then he laughed and laughed, wild and hysterical, as thunder boomed and timbers moaned and waves crashed all around him.\nBy the time the storm abated and the surviving passengers and crew came crawling back on deck, like pale pink worms wriggling to the surface after a rain, the Selaesori Qhoran was a broken thing, floating low in the water and listing ten degrees to port, her hull sprung in half a hundred places, her hold awash in seawater, her mast a splintered ruin no taller than a dwarf. Even her figurehead had not escaped; one of his arms had broken off, the one with all his scrolls. Nine men had been lost, including a mate, two of the fiery fingers, and Moqorro himself.\nDid Benerro see this in his fires? Tyrion wondered, when he realized the huge red priest was gone. Did Moqorro?\n\u201cProphecy is like a half-trained mule,\u201d he complained to Jorah Mormont. \u201cIt looks as though it might be useful, but the moment you trust in it, it kicks you in the head. That bloody widow knew the ship would never reach her destination, she warned us of that, said Benerro saw it in his fires, only I took that to mean\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, what does it matter?\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cWhat it really meant was that some bloody big storm would turn our mast to kindling so we could drift aimlessly across the Gulf of Grief until our food ran out and we started eating one another. Who do you suppose they\u2019ll carve up first\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the pig, the dog, or me?\u201d\n\u201cThe noisiest, I\u2019d say.\u201d\nThe captain died the following day, the ship\u2019s cook three nights later. It was all that the remaining crew could do to keep the wreck afloat. The mate who had assumed command reckoned that they were somewhere off the southern end of the Isle of Cedars. When he lowered the ship\u2019s boats to tow them toward the nearest land, one sank and the men in the other cut the line and rowed off north, abandoning the cog and all their shipmates.\n\u201cSlaves,\u201d said Jorah Mormont, contemptuous.\nThe big knight had slept through the storm, to hear him tell it. Tyrion had his doubts, but he kept them to himself. One day he might want to bite someone in the leg, and for that you needed teeth. Mormont seemed content to ignore their disagreement, so Tyrion decided to pretend it had not happened.\nFor nineteen days they drifted, as food and water dwindled. The sun beat down on them, relentless. Penny huddled in her cabin with her dog and her pig, and Tyrion brought her food, limping on his bandaged calf and sniffing at the wound by night. When he had nothing else to do, he pricked his toes and fingers too. Ser Jorah made a point of sharpening his sword each day, honing the point until it gleamed. The three remaining fiery fingers lit the nightfire as the sun went down, but they wore their ornate armor as they led the crew in prayer, and their spears were close at hand. And not a single sailor tried to rub the head of either dwarf.\n\u201cShould we joust for them again?\u201d Penny asked one night.\n\u201cBest not,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThat would only serve to remind them we have a nice plump pig.\u201d Though Pretty was growing less plump with every passing day, and Crunch was fur and bones.\nThat night he dreamed that he was back in King\u2019s Landing again, a crossbow in his hand. \u201cWherever whores go,\u201d Lord Tywin said, but when Tyrion\u2019s finger clenched and the bowstring thrummed, it was Penny with the quarrel buried in her belly.\nHe woke to the sound of shouting.\nThe deck was moving under him, and for half a heartbeat he was so confused he thought he was back on the Shy Maid. A whiff of pigshit brought him to his senses. The Sorrows were behind him, half a world away, and the joys of that time as well. He remembered how sweet Lemore had looked after her morning swims, with beads of water glistening on her naked skin, but the only maiden here was his poor Penny, the stunted little dwarf girl.\nSomething was afoot, though. Tyrion slipped from the hammock, yawning, and looked about for his boots. And mad though it was, he looked for the crossbow as well, but of course there was none such to be found. A pity, he mused, it might have been some use when the big folk come to eat me. He pulled his boots on and climbed on deck to see what the shouting was about. Penny was there before him, her eyes wide with wonder. \u201cA sail,\u201d she shouted, \u201cthere, there, do you see? A sail, and they\u2019ve seen us, they have. A sail.\u201d\nThis time he kissed her\u00a0\u2026\u00a0once on each cheek, once on the brow, and one last one on the mouth. She was flushed and laughing by the last kiss, suddenly shy again, but it made no matter. The other ship was closing. A big galley, he saw. Her oars left a long white wake behind her. \u201cWhat ship is that?\u201d he asked Ser Jorah Mormont. \u201cCan you read her name?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to read her name. We\u2019re downwind. I can smell her.\u201d Mormont drew his sword. \u201cThat\u2019s a slaver.\u201d",

      "content": "THE TURNCLOAK\nThe first flakes came drifting down as the sun was setting in the west. By nightfall snow was coming down so heavily that the moon rose behind a white curtain, unseen.\n\u201cThe gods of the north have unleashed their wroth on Lord Stannis,\u201d Roose Bolton announced come morning as men gathered in Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall to break their fast. \u201cHe is a stranger here, and the old gods will not suffer him to live.\u201d\nHis men roared their approval, banging their fists on the long plank tables. Winterfell might be ruined, but its granite walls would still keep the worst of the wind and weather at bay. They were well stocked with food and drink; they had fires to warm them when off duty, a place to dry their clothes, snug corners to lie down and sleep. Lord Bolton had laid by enough wood to keep the fires fed for half a year, so the Great Hall was always warm and cozy. Stannis had none of that.\nTheon Greyjoy did not join the uproar. Neither did the men of House Frey, he did not fail to note. They are strangers here as well, he thought, watching Ser Aenys Frey and his half-brother Ser Hosteen. Born and bred in the riverlands, the Freys had never seen a snow like this. The north has already claimed three of their blood, Theon thought, recalling the men that Ramsay had searched for fruitlessly, lost between White Harbor and Barrowton.\nOn the dais, Lord Wyman Manderly sat between a pair of his White Harbor knights, spooning porridge into his fat face. He did not seem to be enjoying it near as much as he had the pork pies at the wedding. Elsewhere one-armed Harwood Stout talked quietly with the cadaverous Whoresbane Umber.\nTheon queued up with the other men for porridge, ladled into wooden bowls from a row of copper kettles. The lords and knights had milk and honey and even a bit of butter to sweeten their portions, he saw, but none of that would be offered him. His reign as prince of Winterfell had been a brief one. He had played his part in the mummer\u2019s show, giving the feigned Arya to be wed, and now he was of no further use to Roose Bolton.\n\u201cFirst winter I remember, the snows came over my head,\u201d said a Hornwood man in the queue ahead of him.\n\u201cAye, but you were only three foot tall at the time,\u201d a rider from the Rills replied.\nLast night, unable to sleep, Theon had found himself brooding on escape, of slipping away unseen whilst Ramsay and his lord father had their attention elsewhere. Every gate was closed and barred and heavily guarded, though; no one was allowed to enter or depart the castle without Lord Bolton\u2019s leave. Even if he found some secret way out, Theon would not have trusted it. He had not forgotten Kyra and her keys. And if he did get out, where would he go? His father was dead, and his uncles had no use for him. Pyke was lost to him. The nearest thing to a home that remained to him was here, amongst the bones of Winterfell.\nA ruined man, a ruined castle. This is my place.\nHe was still waiting for his porridge when Ramsay swept into the hall with his Bastard\u2019s Boys, shouting for music. Abel rubbed the sleep from his eyes, took up his lute, and launched into \u201cThe Dornishman\u2019s Wife,\u201d whilst one of his washerwomen beat time on her drum. The singer changed the words, though. Instead of tasting a Dornishman\u2019s wife, he sang of tasting a northman\u2019s daughter.\nHe could lose his tongue for that, Theon thought, as his bowl was being filled. He is only a singer. Lord Ramsay could flay the skin off both his hands, and no one would say a word. But Lord Bolton smiled at the lyric and Ramsay laughed aloud. Then others knew that it was safe to laugh as well. Yellow Dick found the song so funny that wine snorted out his nose.\nLady Arya was not there to share the merriment. She had not been seen outside her chambers since her wedding night. Sour Alyn had been saying that Ramsay kept his bride naked and chained to a bedpost, but Theon knew that was only talk. There were no chains, at least none that men could see. Just a pair of guards outside the bedchamber, to keep the girl from wandering. And she is only naked when she bathes.\nThat she did most every night, though. Lord Ramsay wanted his wife clean. \u201cShe has no handmaids, poor thing,\u201d he had said to Theon. \u201cThat leaves you, Reek. Should I put you in a dress?\u201d He laughed. \u201cPerhaps if you beg it of me. Just now, it will suffice for you to be her bath maid. I won\u2019t have her smelling like you.\u201d So whenever Ramsay had an itch to bed his wife, it fell to Theon to borrow some servingwomen from Lady Walda or Lady Dustin and fetch hot water from the kitchens. Though Arya never spoke to any of them, they could not fail to see her bruises. It is her own fault. She has not pleased him. \u201cJust be Arya,\u201d he told the girl once, as he helped her into the water. \u201cLord Ramsay does not want to hurt you. He only hurts us when we\u00a0\u2026\u00a0when we forget. He never cut me without cause.\u201d\n\u201cTheon\u00a0\u2026\u201d she whispered, weeping.\n\u201cReek.\u201d He grabbed her arm and shook her. \u201cIn here I\u2019m Reek. You have to remember, Arya.\u201d But the girl was no true Stark, only a steward\u2019s whelp. Jeyne, her name is Jeyne. She should not look to me for rescue. Theon Greyjoy might have tried to help her, once. But Theon had been ironborn, and a braver man than Reek. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with weak.\nRamsay had a new plaything to amuse him, one with teats and a cunny\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but soon Jeyne\u2019s tears would lose their savor, and Ramsay would want his Reek again. He will flay me inch by inch. When my fingers are gone he will take my hands. After my toes, my feet. But only when I beg for it, when the pain grows so bad that I plead for him to give me some relief. There would be no hot baths for Reek. He would roll in shit again, forbidden to wash. The clothes he wore would turn to rags, foul and stinking, and he would be made to wear them till they rotted. The best he could hope for was to be returned to the kennels with Ramsay\u2019s girls for company. Kyra, he remembered. The new bitch he calls Kyra.\nHe took his bowl to the back of the hall and found a place on an empty bench, yards away from the nearest torch. Day or night, the benches below the salt were never less than half-full with men drinking, dicing, talking, or sleeping in their clothes in quiet corners. Their serjeants would kick them awake when it came their turn to shrug back into their cloaks and walk the walls. But no man of them would welcome the company of Theon Turncloak, nor did he have much taste for theirs.\nThe gruel was grey and watery, and he pushed it away after his third spoonful and let it congeal in the bowl. At the next table, men were arguing about the storm and wondering aloud how long the snow would fall. \u201cAll day and all night, might be even longer,\u201d insisted one big, black-bearded archer with a Cerwyn axe sewn on his breast. A few of the older men spoke of other snowstorms and insisted this was no more than a light dusting compared to what they\u2019d seen in the winters of their youth. The riverlanders were aghast. They have no love of snow and cold, these southron swords. Men entering the hall huddled by the fires or clapped their hands together over glowing braziers as their cloaks hung dripping from pegs inside the door.\nThe air was thick and smoky and a crust had formed atop his porridge when a woman\u2019s voice behind him said, \u201cTheon Greyjoy.\u201d\nMy name is Reek, he almost said. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nShe sat down next to him, straddling the bench, and pushed a wild mop of red-brown hair out of her eyes. \u201cWhy do you eat alone, m\u2019lord? Come, rise, join the dance.\u201d\nHe went back to his porridge. \u201cI don\u2019t dance.\u201d The Prince of Winterfell had been a graceful dancer, but Reek with his missing toes would be grotesque. \u201cLeave me be. I have no coin.\u201d\nThe woman smiled crookedly. \u201cDo you take me for a whore?\u201d She was one of the singer\u2019s washerwomen, the tall skinny one, too lean and leathery to be called pretty\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though there was a time when Theon would have tumbled her all the same, to see how it felt to have those long legs wrapped around him. \u201cWhat good would coin do me here? What would I buy with it, some snow?\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou could pay me with a smile. I\u2019ve never seen you smile, not even during your sister\u2019s wedding feast.\u201d\n\u201cLady Arya is not my sister.\u201d I do not smile either, he might have told her. Ramsay hated my smiles, so he took a hammer to my teeth. I can hardly eat. \u201cShe never was my sister.\u201d\n\u201cA pretty maid, though.\u201d\nI was never beautiful like Sansa, but they all said I was pretty. Jeyne\u2019s words seemed to echo in his head, to the beat of the drums two of Abel\u2019s other girls were pounding. Another one had pulled Little Walder Frey up onto the table to teach him how to dance. All the men were laughing. \u201cLeave me be,\u201d said Theon.\n\u201cAm I not to m\u2019lord\u2019s taste? I could send Myrtle to you if you want. Or Holly, might be you\u2019d like her better. All the men like Holly. They\u2019re not my sisters neither, but they\u2019re sweet.\u201d The woman leaned close. Her breath smelled of wine. \u201cIf you have no smile for me, tell me how you captured Winterfell. Abel will put it in a song, and you will live forever.\u201d\n\u201cAs a betrayer. As Theon Turncloak.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not Theon the Clever? It was a daring feat, the way we heard it. How many men did you have? A hundred? Fifty?\u201d\nFewer. \u201cIt was madness.\u201d\n\u201cGlorious madness. Stannis has five thousand, they say, but Abel claims ten times as many still could not breach these walls. So how did you get in, m\u2019lord? Did you have some secret way?\u201d\nI had ropes, Theon thought. I had grapnels. I had darkness on my side, and surprise. The castle was but lightly held, and I took them unawares. But he said none of that. If Abel made a song about him, like as not Ramsay would prick his eardrums to make certain that he never heard it.\n\u201cYou can trust me, m\u2019lord. Abel does.\u201d The washerwoman put her hand upon his own. His hands were gloved in wool and leather. Hers were bare, long-fingered, rough, with nails chewed to the quick. \u201cYou never asked my name. It\u2019s Rowan.\u201d\nTheon wrenched away. This was a ploy, he knew it. Ramsay sent her. She\u2019s another of his japes, like Kyra with the keys. A jolly jape, that\u2019s all. He wants me to run, so he can punish me.\nHe wanted to hit her, to smash that mocking smile off her face. He wanted to kiss her, to fuck her right there on the table and make her cry his name. But he knew he dare not touch her, in anger or in lust. Reek, Reek, my name is Reek. I must not forget my name. He jerked to his feet and made his way wordlessly to the doors, limping on his maimed feet.\nOutside the snow was falling still. Wet, heavy, silent, it had already begun to cover the footsteps left by the men coming and going from the hall. The drifts came almost to the top of his boots. It will be deeper in the wolfswood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and out on the kingsroad, where the wind is blowing, there will be no escape from it. A battle was being fought in the yard; Ryswells pelting Barrowton boys with snowballs. Above, he could see some squires building snowmen along the battlements. They were arming them with spears and shields, putting iron halfhelms on their heads, and arraying them along the inner wall, a rank of snowy sentinels. \u201cLord Winter has joined us with his levies,\u201d one of the sentries outside the Great Hall japed\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until he saw Theon\u2019s face and realized who he was talking to. Then he turned his head and spat.\nBeyond the tents the big destriers of the knights from White Harbor and the Twins were shivering in their horse lines. Ramsay had burned the stables when he sacked Winterfell, so his father had thrown up new ones twice as large as the old, to accommodate the warhorses and palfreys of his lords\u2019 bannermen and knights. The rest of the horses were tethered in the wards. Hooded grooms moved amongst them, covering them with blankets to keep them warm.\nTheon made his way deeper into the ruined parts of the castle. As he picked through the shattered stone that had once been Maester Luwin\u2019s turret, ravens looked down from the gash in the wall above, muttering to one another. From time to time one would let out a raucous scream. He stood in the doorway of a bedchamber that had once been his own (ankle deep in snow that had blown in through a shattered window), visited the ruins of Mikken\u2019s forge and Lady Catelyn\u2019s sept. Beneath the Burned Tower, he passed Rickard Ryswell nuzzling at the neck of another one of Abel\u2019s washerwomen, the plump one with the apple cheeks and pug nose. The girl was barefoot in the snow, bundled up in a fur cloak. He thought she might be naked underneath. When she saw him, she said something to Ryswell that made him laugh aloud.\nTheon trudged away from them. There was a stair beyond the mews, seldom used; it was there his feet took him. The steps were steep and treacherous. He climbed carefully and found himself alone on the battlements of the inner wall, well away from the squires and their snowmen. No one had given him freedom of the castle, but no one had denied it to him either. He could go where he would within the walls.\nWinterfell\u2019s inner wall was the older and taller of the two, its ancient grey crenellations rising one hundred feet high, with square towers at every corner. The outer wall, raised many centuries later, was twenty feet lower, but thicker and in better repair, boasting octagonal towers in place of square ones. Between the two walls was the moat, deep and wide\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and frozen. Drifts of snow had begun to creep across its icy surface. Snow was building up along the battlements too, filling the gaps between the merlons and putting pale, soft caps on every tower top.\nBeyond the walls, as far as he could see, the world was turning white. The woods, the fields, the kingsroad\u2014the snows were covering all of them beneath a pale soft mantle, burying the remnants of the winter town, hiding the blackened walls Ramsay\u2019s men had left behind when they put the houses to the torch. The wounds Snow made, snow conceals, but that was wrong. Ramsay was a Bolton now, not a Snow, never a Snow.\nFarther off, the rutted kingsroad had vanished, lost amidst the fields and rolling hills, all one vast expanse of white. And still the snow was falling, drifting down in silence from a windless sky. Stannis Baratheon is out there somewhere, freezing. Would Lord Stannis try to take Winterfell by storm? If he does, his cause is doomed. The castle was too strong. Even with the moat frozen over, Winterfell\u2019s defenses remained formidable. Theon had captured the castle by stealth, sending his best men to scale the walls and swim the moat under the cover of darkness. The defenders had not even known they were under attack until it was too late. No such subterfuge was possible for Stannis.\nHe might prefer to cut the castle off from the outside world and starve out its defenders. Winterfell\u2019s storerooms and cellar vaults were empty. A long supply train had come with Bolton and his friends of Frey up through the Neck, Lady Dustin had brought food and fodder from Barrowton, and Lord Manderly had arrived well provisioned from White Harbor\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the host was large. With so many mouths to feed, their stores could not last for long. Lord Stannis and his men will be just as hungry, though. And cold and footsore as well, in no condition for a fight\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the storm will make them desperate to get inside the castle.\nSnow was falling on the godswood too, melting when it touched the ground. Beneath the white-cloaked trees the earth had turned to mud. Tendrils of mist hung in the air like ghostly ribbons. Why did I come here? These are not my gods. This is not my place. The heart tree stood before him, a pale giant with a carved face and leaves like bloody hands.\nA thin film of ice covered the surface of the pool beneath the weirwood. Theon sank to his knees beside it. \u201cPlease,\u201d he murmured through his broken teeth, \u201cI never meant\u00a0\u2026\u201d The words caught in his throat. \u201cSave me,\u201d he finally managed. \u201cGive me\u00a0\u2026\u201d What? Strength? Courage? Mercy? Snow fell around him, pale and silent, keeping its own counsel. The only sound was a faint soft sobbing. Jeyne, he thought. It is her, sobbing in her bridal bed. Who else could it be? Gods do not weep. Or do they?\nThe sound was too painful to endure. Theon grabbed hold of a branch and pulled himself back to his feet, knocked the snow off his legs, and limped back toward the lights. There are ghosts in Winterfell, he thought, and I am one of them.\nMore snowmen had risen in the yard by the time Theon Greyjoy made his way back. To command the snowy sentinels on the walls, the squires had erected a dozen snowy lords. One was plainly meant to be Lord Manderly; it was the fattest snowman that Theon had ever seen. The one-armed lord could only be Harwood Stout, the snow lady Barbrey Dustin. And the one closest to the door with the beard made of icicles had to be old Whoresbane Umber.\nInside, the cooks were ladling out beef-and-barley stew, thick with carrots and onions, served in trenchers hollowed from loaves of yesterday\u2019s bread. Scraps were thrown onto the floor to be gobbled up by Ramsay\u2019s girls and the other dogs.\nThe girls were glad to see him. They knew him by his smell. Red Jeyne loped over to lick at his hand, and Helicent slipped under the table and curled up by his feet, gnawing at a bone. They were good dogs. It was easy to forget that every one was named for a girl that Ramsay had hunted and killed.\nWeary as he was, Theon had appetite enough to eat a little stew, washed down with ale. By then the hall had grown raucous. Two of Roose Bolton\u2019s scouts had come straggling back through the Hunter\u2019s Gate to report that Lord Stannis\u2019s advance had slowed to a crawl. His knights rode destriers, and the big warhorses were foundering in the snow. The small, sure-footed garrons of the hill clans were faring better, the scouts said, but the clansmen dared not press too far ahead or the whole host would come apart. Lord Ramsay commanded Abel to give them a marching song in honor of Stannis trudging through the snows, so the bard took up his lute again, whilst one of his washerwomen coaxed a sword from Sour Alyn and mimed Stannis slashing at the snowflakes.\nTheon was staring down into the last dregs of his third tankard when Lady Barbrey Dustin swept into the hall and sent two of her sworn swords to bring him to her. When he stood below the dais, she looked him up and down, and sniffed. \u201cThose are the same clothes you wore for the wedding.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lady. They are the clothes I was given.\u201d That was one of the lessons he had learned at the Dreadfort: to take what he was given and never ask for more.\nLady Dustin wore black, as ever, though her sleeves were lined with vair. Her gown had a high stiff collar that framed her face. \u201cYou know this castle.\u201d\n\u201cOnce.\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere beneath us are the crypts where the old Stark kings sit in darkness. My men have not been able to find the way down into them. They have been through all the undercrofts and cellars, even the dungeons, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe crypts cannot be accessed from the dungeons, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cCan you show me the way down?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing down there but\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014dead Starks? Aye. And all my favorite Starks are dead, as it happens. Do you know the way or not?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d He did not like the crypts, had never liked the crypts, but he was no stranger to them.\n\u201cShow me. Serjeant, fetch a lantern.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady will want a warm cloak,\u201d cautioned Theon. \u201cWe will need to go outside.\u201d\nThe snow was coming down heavier than ever when they left the hall, with Lady Dustin wrapped in sable. Huddled in their hooded cloaks, the guards outside were almost indistinguishable from the snowmen. Only their breath fogging the air gave proof that they still lived. Fires burned along the battlements, a vain attempt to drive the gloom away. Their small party found themselves slogging through a smooth, unbroken expanse of white that came halfway up their calves. The tents in the yard were half-buried, sagging under the weight of the accumulation.\nThe entrance to the crypts was in the oldest section of the castle, near the foot of the First Keep, which had sat unused for hundreds of years. Ramsay had put it to the torch when he sacked Winterfell, and much of what had not burned had collapsed. Only a shell remained, one side open to the elements and filling up with snow. Rubble was strewn all about it: great chunks of shattered masonry, burned beams, broken gargoyles. The falling snow had covered almost all of it, but part of one gargoyle still poked above the drift, its grotesque face snarling sightless at the sky.\nThis is where they found Bran when he fell. Theon had been out hunting that day, riding with Lord Eddard and King Robert, with no hint of the dire news that awaited them back at the castle. He remembered Robb\u2019s face when they told him. No one had expected the broken boy to live. The gods could not kill Bran, no more than I could. It was a strange thought, and stranger still to remember that Bran might still be alive.\n\u201cThere.\u201d Theon pointed to where a snowbank had crept up the wall of the keep. \u201cUnder there. Watch for broken stones.\u201d\nIt took Lady Dustin\u2019s men the better part of half an hour to uncover the entrance, shoveling through the snow and shifting rubble. When they did, the door was frozen shut. Her serjeant had to go find an axe before he could pull it open, hinges screaming, to reveal stone steps spiraling down into darkness.\n\u201cIt is a long way down, my lady,\u201d Theon cautioned.\nLady Dustin was undeterred. \u201cBeron, the light.\u201d\nThe way was narrow and steep, the steps worn in the center by centuries of feet. They went single file\u2014the serjeant with the lantern, then Theon and Lady Dustin, her other man behind them. He had always thought of the crypts as cold, and so they seemed in summer, but now as they descended the air grew warmer. Not warm, never warm, but warmer than above. Down there below the earth, it would seem, the chill was constant, unchanging.\n\u201cThe bride weeps,\u201d Lady Dustin said, as they made their way down, step by careful step. \u201cOur little Lady Arya.\u201d\nTake care now. Take care, take care. He put one hand on the wall. The shifting torchlight made the steps seem to move beneath his feet. \u201cAs\u00a0\u2026\u00a0as you say, m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cRoose is not pleased. Tell your bastard that.\u201d\nHe is not my bastard, he wanted to say, but another voice inside him said, He is, he is. Reek belongs to Ramsay, and Ramsay belongs to Reek. You must not forget your name.\n\u201cDressing her in grey and white serves no good if the girl is left to sob. The Freys may not care, but the northmen\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they fear the Dreadfort, but they love the Starks.\u201d\n\u201cNot you,\u201d said Theon.\n\u201cNot me,\u201d the Lady of Barrowton confessed, \u201cbut the rest, yes. Old Whoresbane is only here because the Freys hold the Greatjon captive. And do you imagine the Hornwood men have forgotten the Bastard\u2019s last marriage, and how his lady wife was left to starve, chewing her own fingers? What do you think passes through their heads when they hear the new bride weeping? Valiant Ned\u2019s precious little girl.\u201d\nNo, he thought. She is not of Lord Eddard\u2019s blood, her name is Jeyne, she is only a steward\u2019s daughter. He did not doubt that Lady Dustin suspected, but even so\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cLady Arya\u2019s sobs do us more harm than all of Lord Stannis\u2019s swords and spears. If the Bastard means to remain Lord of Winterfell, he had best teach his wife to laugh.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d Theon broke in. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\n\u201cThe steps go farther down,\u201d observed Lady Dustin.\n\u201cThere are lower levels. Older. The lowest level is partly collapsed, I hear. I have never been down there.\u201d He pushed the door open and led them out into a long vaulted tunnel, where mighty granite pillars marched two by two into blackness.\nLady Dustin\u2019s serjeant raised the lantern. Shadows slid and shifted. A small light in a great darkness. Theon had never felt comfortable in the crypts. He could feel the stone kings staring down at him with their stone eyes, stone fingers curled around the hilts of rusted longswords. None had any love for ironborn. A familiar sense of dread filled him.\n\u201cSo many,\u201d Lady Dustin said. \u201cDo you know their names?\u201d\n\u201cOnce\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but that was a long time ago.\u201d Theon pointed. \u201cThe ones on this side were Kings in the North. Torrhen was the last.\u201d\n\u201cThe King Who Knelt.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lady. After him they were only lords.\u201d\n\u201cUntil the Young Wolf. Where is Ned Stark\u2019s tomb?\u201d\n\u201cAt the end. This way, my lady.\u201d\nTheir footsteps echoed through the vault as they made their way between the rows of pillars. The stone eyes of the dead men seemed to follow them, and the eyes of their stone direwolves as well. The faces stirred faint memories. A few names came back to him, unbidden, whispered in the ghostly voice of Maester Luwin. King Edrick Snowbeard, who had ruled the north for a hundred years. Brandon the Shipwright, who had sailed beyond the sunset. Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf. My namesake. Lord Beron Stark, who made common cause with Casterly Rock to war against Dagon Greyjoy, Lord of Pyke, in the days when the Seven Kingdoms were ruled in all but name by the bastard sorcerer men called Bloodraven.\n\u201cThat king is missing his sword,\u201d Lady Dustin observed.\nIt was true. Theon did not recall which king it was, but the longsword he should have held was gone. Streaks of rust remained to show where it had been. The sight disquieted him. He had always heard that the iron in the sword kept the spirits of the dead locked within their tombs. If a sword was missing\u00a0\u2026\nThere are ghosts in Winterfell. And I am one of them.\nThey walked on. Barbrey Dustin\u2019s face seemed to harden with every step. She likes this place no more than I do. Theon heard himself say, \u201cMy lady, why do you hate the Starks?\u201d\nShe studied him. \u201cFor the same reason you love them.\u201d\nTheon stumbled. \u201cLove them? I never\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I took this castle from them, my lady. I had\u00a0\u2026\u00a0had Bran and Rickon put to death, mounted their heads on spikes, I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0rode south with Robb Stark, fought beside him at the Whispering Wood and Riverrun, returned to the Iron Islands as his envoy to treat with your own father. Barrowton sent men with the Young Wolf as well. I gave him as few men as I dared, but I knew that I must needs give him some or risk the wroth of Winterfell. So I had my own eyes and ears in that host. They kept me well informed. I know who you are. I know what you are. Now answer my question. Why do you love the Starks?\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u201d Theon put a gloved hand against a pillar. \u201c\u2026\u00a0I wanted to be one of them\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd never could. We have more in common than you know, my lord. But come.\u201d\nOnly a little farther on, three tombs were closely grouped together. That was where they halted. \u201cLord Rickard,\u201d Lady Dustin observed, studying the central figure. The statue loomed above them\u2014long-faced, bearded, solemn. He had the same stone eyes as the rest, but his looked sad. \u201cHe lacks a sword as well.\u201d\nIt was true. \u201cSomeone has been down here stealing swords. Brandon\u2019s is gone as well.\u201d\n\u201cHe would hate that.\u201d She pulled off her glove and touched his knee, pale flesh against dark stone. \u201cBrandon loved his sword. He loved to hone it. \u2018I want it sharp enough to shave the hair from a woman\u2019s cunt,\u2019 he used to say. And how he loved to use it. \u2018A bloody sword is a beautiful thing,\u2019 he told me once.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew him,\u201d Theon said.\nThe lantern light in her eyes made them seem as if they were afire. \u201cBrandon was fostered at Barrowton with old Lord Dustin, the father of the one I\u2019d later wed, but he spent most of his time riding the Rills. He loved to ride. His little sister took after him in that. A pair of centaurs, those two. And my lord father was always pleased to play host to the heir to Winterfell. My father had great ambitions for House Ryswell. He would have served up my maidenhead to any Stark who happened by, but there was no need. Brandon was never shy about taking what he wanted. I am old now, a dried-up thing, too long a widow, but I still remember the look of my maiden\u2019s blood on his cock the night he claimed me. I think Brandon liked the sight as well. A bloody sword is a beautiful thing, yes. It hurt, but it was a sweet pain.\n\u201cThe day I learned that Brandon was to marry Catelyn Tully, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there was nothing sweet about that pain. He never wanted her, I promise you that. He told me so, on our last night together\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Rickard Stark had great ambitions too. Southron ambitions that would not be served by having his heir marry the daughter of one of his own vassals. Afterward my father nursed some hope of wedding me to Brandon\u2019s brother Eddard, but Catelyn Tully got that one as well. I was left with young Lord Dustin, until Ned Stark took him from me.\u201d\n\u201cRobert\u2019s Rebellion\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLord Dustin and I had not been married half a year when Robert rose and Ned Stark called his banners. I begged my husband not to go. He had kin he might have sent in his stead. An uncle famed for his prowess with an axe, a great-uncle who had fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. But he was a man and full of pride, nothing would serve but that he lead the Barrowton levies himself. I gave him a horse the day he set out, a red stallion with a fiery mane, the pride of my lord father\u2019s herds. My lord swore that he would ride him home when the war was done.\n\u201cNed Stark returned the horse to me on his way back home to Winterfell. He told me that my lord had died an honorable death, that his body had been laid to rest beneath the red mountains of Dorne. He brought his sister\u2019s bones back north, though, and there she rests\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I promise you, Lord Eddard\u2019s bones will never rest beside hers. I mean to feed them to my dogs.\u201d\nTheon did not understand. \u201cHis\u00a0\u2026\u00a0his bones \u2026?\u201d\nHer lips twisted. It was an ugly smile, a smile that reminded him of Ramsay\u2019s. \u201cCatelyn Tully dispatched Lord Eddard\u2019s bones north before the Red Wedding, but your iron uncle seized Moat Cailin and closed the way. I have been watching ever since. Should those bones ever emerge from the swamps, they will get no farther than Barrowton.\u201d She threw one last lingering look at the likeness of Eddard Stark. \u201cWe are done here.\u201d\nThe snowstorm was still raging when they emerged from the crypts. Lady Dustin was silent during their ascent, but when they stood beneath the ruins of the First Keep again she shivered and said, \u201cYou would do well not to repeat anything I might have said down there. Is that understood?\u201d\nIt was. \u201cHold my tongue or lose it.\u201d\n\u201cRoose has trained you well.\u201d She left him there.",

      "content": "THE KING\u2019S PRIZE\nThe king\u2019s host departed Deepwood Motte by the light of a golden dawn, uncoiling from behind the log palisades like a long, steel serpent emerging from its nest.\nThe southron knights rode out in plate and mail, dinted and scarred by the battles they had fought, but still bright enough to glitter when they caught the rising sun. Faded and stained, torn and mended, their banners and surcoats still made a riot of colors amidst the winter wood\u2014azure and orange, red and green, purple and blue and gold, glimmering amongst bare brown trunks, grey-green pines and sentinels, drifts of dirty snow.\nEach knight had his squires, servants, and men-at-arms. Behind them came armorers, cooks, grooms; ranks of spearmen, axemen, archers; grizzled veterans of a hundred battles and green boys off to fight their first. Before them marched the clansmen from the hills; chiefs and champions astride shaggy garrons, their hirsute fighters trotting beside them, clad in furs and boiled leather and old mail. Some painted their faces brown and green and tied bundles of brush about them, to hide amongst the trees.\nBack of the main column the baggage train followed: mules, horses, oxen, a mile of wayns and carts laden with food, fodder, tents, and other provisions. Last the rear guard\u2014more knights in plate and mail, with a screening of outriders following half-hidden to make certain no foe could steal up on them unawares.\nAsha Greyjoy rode in the baggage train, in a covered wayn with two huge iron-rimmed wheels, fettered at wrist and ankle and watched over day and night by a She-Bear who snored worse than any man. His Grace King Stannis was taking no chances on his prize escaping captivity. He meant to carry her to Winterfell, to display her there in chains for the lords of the north to see, the kraken\u2019s daughter bound and broken, proof of his power.\nTrumpets saw the column on its way. Spearpoints shone in the light of the rising sun, and all along the verges the grass glistened with the morning frost. Between Deepwood Motte and Winterfell lay one hundred leagues of forest. Three hundred miles as the raven flies. \u201cFifteen days,\u201d the knights told each other.\n\u201cRobert would have done it in ten,\u201d Asha heard Lord Fell boasting. His grandsire had been slain by Robert at Summerhall; somehow this had elevated his slayer to godlike prowess in the grandson\u2019s eyes. \u201cRobert would have been inside Winterfell a fortnight ago, thumbing his nose at Bolton from the battlements.\u201d\n\u201cBest not mention that to Stannis,\u201d suggested Justin Massey, \u201cor he\u2019ll have us marching nights as well as days.\u201d\nThis king lives in his brother\u2019s shadow, Asha thought.\nHer ankle still gave a stab of pain whenever she tried to put her weight on it. Something was broken down inside, Asha did not doubt. The swelling had gone down at Deepwood, but the pain remained. A sprain would surely have healed by now. Her irons clacked every time she moved. The fetters chafed at her wrists and at her pride. But that was the cost of submission.\n\u201cNo man has ever died from bending his knee,\u201d her father had once told her. \u201cHe who kneels may rise again, blade in hand. He who will not kneel stays dead, stiff legs and all.\u201d Balon Greyjoy had proved the truth of his own words when his first rebellion failed; the kraken bent the knee to stag and direwolf, only to rise again when Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark were dead.\nAnd so at Deepwood the kraken\u2019s daughter had done the same when she was dumped before the king, bound and limping (though blessedly unraped), her ankle a blaze of pain. \u201cI yield, Your Grace. Do as you wish with me. I ask only that you spare my men.\u201d Qarl and Tris and the rest who had survived the wolfswood were all she had to care about. Only nine remained. We ragged nine, Cromm named them. He was the worst wounded.\nStannis had given her their lives. Yet she sensed no true mercy in the man. He was determined, beyond a doubt. Nor did he lack for courage. Men said he was just\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and if his was a harsh, hard-handed sort of justice, well, life on the Iron Islands had accustomed Asha Greyjoy to that. All the same, she could not like this king. Those deep-set blue eyes of his seemed always slitted in suspicion, cold fury boiling just below their surface. Her life meant little and less to him. She was only his hostage, a prize to show the north that he could vanquish the ironborn.\nMore fool him. Bringing down a woman was not like to awe any northmen, if she knew the breed, and her worth as a hostage was less than naught. Her uncle ruled the Iron Islands now, and the Crow\u2019s Eye would not care if she lived or died. It might matter some to the wretched ruin of a husband that Euron had inflicted upon her, but Eric Ironmaker did not have coin enough to ransom her. But there was no explaining such things to Stannis Baratheon. Her very womanhood seemed to offend him. Men from the green lands liked their women soft and sweet in silk, she knew, not clad in mail and leather with a throwing axe in each hand. But her short acquaintance with the king at Deepwood Motte convinced her that he would have been no more fond of her in a gown. Even with Galbart Glover\u2019s wife, the pious Lady Sybelle, he had been correct and courteous but plainly uncomfortable. This southron king seemed to be one of those men to whom women are another race, as strange and unfathomable as giants and grumkins and the children of the forest. The She-Bear made him grind his teeth as well.\nThere was only one woman that Stannis listened to, and he had left her on the Wall. \u201cThough I would sooner she was with us,\u201d confessed Ser Justin Massey, the fair-haired knight who commanded the baggage train. \u201cThe last time we went into battle without Lady Melisandre was the Blackwater, when Lord Renly\u2019s shade came down upon us and drove half our host into the bay.\u201d\n\u201cThe last time?\u201d Asha said. \u201cWas this sorceress at Deepwood Motte? I did not see her.\u201d\n\u201cHardly a battle,\u201d Ser Justin said, smiling. \u201cYour ironmen fought bravely, my lady, but we had many times your numbers, and we took you unawares. Winterfell will know that we are coming. And Roose Bolton has as many men as we do.\u201d\nOr more, thought Asha.\nEven prisoners have ears, and she had heard all the talk at Deepwood Motte, when King Stannis and his captains were debating this march. Ser Justin had opposed it from the start, along with many of the knights and lords who had come with Stannis from the south. But the wolves insisted; Roose Bolton could not be suffered to hold Winterfell, and the Ned\u2019s girl must be rescued from the clutches of his bastard. So said Morgan Liddle, Brandon Norrey, Big Bucket Wull, the Flints, even the She-Bear. \u201cOne hundred leagues from Deepwood Motte to Winterfell,\u201d said Artos Flint, the night the argument boiled to a head in Galbart Glover\u2019s longhall. \u201cThree hundred miles as the raven flies.\u201d\n\u201cA long march,\u201d a knight named Corliss Penny said.\n\u201cNot so long as that,\u201d insisted Ser Godry, the big knight the others called the Giantslayer. \u201cWe have come as far already. The Lord of Light will blaze a path for us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when we arrive before Winterfell?\u201d said Justin Massey. \u201cTwo walls with a moat between them, and the inner wall a hundred feet high. Bolton will never march out to face us in the field, and we do not have the provisions to mount a siege.\u201d\n\u201cArnolf Karstark will join his strength to ours, never forget,\u201d said Harwood Fell. \u201cMors Umber as well. We will have as many northmen as Lord Bolton. And the woods are thick north of the castle. We will raise siege towers, build rams\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nAnd die by the thousands, Asha thought.\n\u201cWe might do best to winter here,\u201d suggested Lord Peasebury.\n\u201cWinter here?\u201d Big Bucket roared. \u201cHow much food and fodder do you think Galbart Glover has laid by?\u201d\nThen Ser Richard Horpe, the knight with the ravaged face and the death\u2019s-head moths on his surcoat, turned to Stannis and said, \u201cYour Grace, your brother\u2014\u201d\nThe king cut him off. \u201cWe all know what my brother would do. Robert would gallop up to the gates of Winterfell alone, break them with his warhammer, and ride through the rubble to slay Roose Bolton with his left hand and the Bastard with his right.\u201d Stannis rose to his feet. \u201cI am not Robert. But we will march, and we will free Winterfell\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or die in the attempt.\u201d\nWhatever doubts his lords might nurse, the common men seemed to have faith in their king. Stannis had smashed Mance Rayder\u2019s wildlings at the Wall and cleaned Asha and her ironborn out of Deepwood Motte; he was Robert\u2019s brother, victor in a famous sea battle off Fair Isle, the man who had held Storm\u2019s End all through Robert\u2019s Rebellion. And he bore a hero\u2019s sword, the enchanted blade Lightbringer, whose glow lit up the night.\n\u201cOur foes are not as formidable as they appear,\u201d Ser Justin assured Asha on the first day of the march. \u201cRoose Bolton is feared, but little loved. And his friends the Freys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the north has not forgotten the Red Wedding. Every lord at Winterfell lost kinsmen there. Stannis need only bloody Bolton, and the northmen will abandon him.\u201d\nSo you hope, thought Asha, but first the king must bloody him. Only a fool deserts the winning side.\nSer Justin called upon her cart half a dozen times that first day, to bring her food and drink and tidings of the march. A man of easy smiles and endless japes, large and well fleshed, with pink cheeks, blue eyes, and a wind-tossed tangle of white-blond hair as pale as flax, he was a considerate gaoler, ever solicitous of his captive\u2019s comfort.\n\u201cHe wants you,\u201d said the She-Bear, after his third visit.\nHer proper name was Alysane of House Mormont, but she wore the other name as easily as she wore her mail. Short, chunky, muscular, the heir to Bear Island had big thighs, big breasts, and big hands ridged with callus. Even in sleep she wore ringmail under her furs, boiled leather under that, and an old sheepskin under the leather, turned inside out for warmth. All those layers made her look almost as wide as she was tall. And ferocious. Sometimes it was hard for Asha Greyjoy to remember that she and the She-Bear were almost of an age.\n\u201cHe wants my lands,\u201d Asha replied. \u201cHe wants the Iron Islands.\u201d She knew the signs. She had seen the same before in other suitors. Massey\u2019s own ancestral holdings, far to the south, were lost to him, so he must needs make an advantageous marriage or resign himself to being no more than a knight of the king\u2019s household. Stannis had frustrated Ser Justin\u2019s hopes of marrying the wildling princess that Asha had heard so much of, so now he had set his sights on her. No doubt he dreamed of putting her in the Seastone Chair on Pyke and ruling through her, as her lord and master. That would require ridding her of her present lord and master, to be sure\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not to mention the uncle who had married her to him. Not likely, Asha judged. The Crow\u2019s Eye could eat Ser Justin to break his fast and never even belch.\nIt made no matter. Her father\u2019s lands would never be hers, no matter whom she married. The ironborn were not a forgiving people, and Asha had been defeated twice. Once at the kingsmoot by her uncle Euron, and again at Deepwood Motte by Stannis. More than enough to stamp her as unfit to rule. Wedding Justin Massey, or any of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s lordlings, would hurt more than it helped. The kraken\u2019s daughter turned out to be just a woman after all, the captains and the kings would say. See how she spreads her legs for this soft green land lord.\nStill, if Ser Justin wished to court her favor with food and wine and words, Asha was not like to discourage him. He made for better company than the taciturn She-Bear, and she was elsewise alone amongst five thousand foes. Tris Botley, Qarl the Maid, Cromm, Roggon, and the rest of her bloodied band had been left behind at Deepwood Motte, in Galbart Glover\u2019s dungeons.\nThe army covered twenty-two miles the first day, by the reckoning of the guides Lady Sybelle had given them, trackers and hunters sworn to Deepwood with clan names like Forrester and Woods, Branch and Bole. The second day the host made twenty-four, as their vanguard passed beyond the Glover lands into the thick of the wolfswood. \u201cR\u2019hllor, send your light to lead us through this gloom,\u201d the faithful prayed that night as they gathered about a roaring blaze outside the king\u2019s pavilion. Southron knights and men-at-arms, the lot of them. Asha would have called them king\u2019s men, but the other stormlanders and crownlands men named them queen\u2019s men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though the queen they followed was the red one at Castle Black, not the wife that Stannis Baratheon had left behind at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. \u201cOh, Lord of Light, we beseech you, cast your fiery eye upon us and keep us safe and warm,\u201d they sang to the flames, \u201cfor the night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d\nA big knight named Ser Godry Farring led them. Godry the Giantslayer. A big name for a small man. Farring was broad-chested and well muscled under his plate and mail. He was also arrogant and vain, it seemed to Asha, hungry for glory, deaf to caution, a glutton for praise, and contemptuous of smallfolk, wolves, and women. In the last, he was not unlike his king.\n\u201cLet me have a horse,\u201d Asha asked Ser Justin, when he rode up to the wayn with half a ham. \u201cI am going mad in these chains. I will not attempt escape. You have my word on that.\u201d\n\u201cWould that I could, my lady. You are the king\u2019s captive, not mine own.\u201d\n\u201cYour king will not take a woman\u2019s word.\u201d\nThe She-Bear growled. \u201cWhy should we trust the word of any ironman after what your brother did at Winterfell?\u201d\n\u201cI am not Theon,\u201d Asha insisted\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the chains remained.\nAs Ser Justin galloped down the column, she found herself remembering the last time she had seen her mother. It had been on Harlaw, at Ten Towers. A candle had been flickering in her mother\u2019s chamber, but her great carved bed was empty beneath its dusty canopy. Lady Alannys sat beside a window, staring out across the sea. \u201cDid you bring my baby boy?\u201d she\u2019d asked, mouth trembling. \u201cTheon could not come,\u201d Asha had told her, looking down upon the ruin of the woman who had given her birth, a mother who had lost two of her sons. And the third\u00a0\u2026\nI send you each a piece of prince.\nWhatever befell when battle was joined at Winterfell, Asha Greyjoy did not think her brother likely to survive it. Theon Turncloak. Even the She-Bear wants his head on a spike.\n\u201cDo you have brothers?\u201d Asha asked her keeper.\n\u201cSisters,\u201d Alysane Mormont replied, gruff as ever. \u201cFive, we were. All girls. Lyanna is back on Bear Island. Lyra and Jory are with our mother. Dacey was murdered.\u201d\n\u201cThe Red Wedding.\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d Alysane stared at Asha for a moment. \u201cI have a son. He\u2019s only two. My daughter\u2019s nine.\u201d\n\u201cYou started young.\u201d\n\u201cToo young. But better that than wait too late.\u201d\nA stab at me, Asha thought, but let it be. \u201cYou are wed.\u201d\n\u201cNo. My children were fathered by a bear.\u201d Alysane smiled. Her teeth were crooked, but there was something ingratiating about that smile. \u201cMormont women are skinchangers. We turn into bears and find mates in the woods. Everyone knows.\u201d\nAsha smiled back. \u201cMormont women are all fighters too.\u201d\nThe other woman\u2019s smile faded. \u201cWhat we are is what you made us. On Bear Island every child learns to fear krakens rising from the sea.\u201d\nThe Old Way. Asha turned away, chains clinking faintly. On the third day the forest pressed close around them, and the rutted roads dwindled down to game trails that soon proved to be too narrow for their larger wagons. Here and there they wound their way past familiar landmarks: a stony hill that looked a bit like a wolf\u2019s head when seen from a certain angle, a half-frozen waterfall, a natural stone arch bearded with grey-green moss. Asha knew them all. She had come this way before, riding to Winterfell to persuade her brother Theon to abandon his conquest and return with her to the safety of Deepwood Motte. I failed in that as well.\nThat day they made fourteen miles, and were glad of it.\nWhen dusk fell, the driver pulled the wayn off under the tree. As he was loosing the horses from the traces, Ser Justin trotted up and undid the fetters around Asha\u2019s ankles. He and the She-Bear escorted her through the camp to the king\u2019s tent. A captive she might be, but she was still a Greyjoy of Pyke, and it pleased Stannis Baratheon to feed her scraps from his own table, where he supped with his captains and commanders.\nThe king\u2019s pavilion was near as large as the longhall back at Deepwood Motte, but there was little grand about it beyond its size. Its stiff walls of heavy yellow canvas were badly faded, stained by mud and water, with spots of mildew showing. Atop its center pole flew the royal standard, golden, with a stag\u2019s head within a burning heart. On three sides the pavilions of the southron lordlings who had come north with Stannis surrounded it. On the fourth side the nightfire roared, lashing at the darkening sky with swirls of flame.\nA dozen men were splitting logs to feed the blaze when Asha came limping up with her keepers. Queen\u2019s men. Their god was Red R\u2019hllor, and a jealous god he was. Her own god, the Drowned God of the Iron Isles, was a demon to their eyes, and if she did not embrace this Lord of Light, she would be damned and doomed. They would as gladly burn me as those logs and broken branches. Some had urged that very thing within her hearing after the battle in the woods. Stannis had refused.\nThe king stood outside his tent, staring into the nightfire. What does he see there? Victory? Doom? The face of his red and hungry god? His eyes were sunk in deep pits, his close-cropped beard no more than a shadow across his hollow cheeks and bony jawbone. Yet there was power in his stare, an iron ferocity that told Asha this man would never, ever turn back from his course.\nShe went to one knee before him. \u201cSire.\u201d Am I humbled enough for you, Your Grace? Am I beaten, bowed, and broken sufficiently for your liking? \u201cStrike these chains from my wrists, I beg you. Let me ride. I will attempt no escape.\u201d\nStannis looked at her as he might look at a dog who presumed to hump against his leg. \u201cYou earned those irons.\u201d\n\u201cI did. Now I offer you my men, my ships, my wits.\u201d\n\u201cYour ships are mine, or burnt. Your men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how many are left? Ten? Twelve?\u201d\nNine. Six, if you count only those strong enough to fight. \u201cDagmer Cleftjaw holds Torrhen\u2019s Square. A fierce fighter, and a leal servant of House Greyjoy. I can deliver that castle to you, and its garrison as well.\u201d Perhaps, she might have added, but it would not serve her cause to show doubt before this king.\n\u201cTorrhen\u2019s Square is not worth the mud beneath my heels. It is Winterfell that matters.\u201d\n\u201cStrike off these irons and let me help you take it, Sire. Your Grace\u2019s royal brother was renowned for turning fallen foes into friends. Make me your man.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods did not make you a man. How can I?\u201d Stannis turned back to the nightfire and whatever he saw dancing there amongst the orange flames.\nSer Justin Massey grasped Asha by the arm and pulled her inside the royal tent. \u201cThat was ill judged, my lady,\u201d he told her. \u201cNever speak to him of Robert.\u201d\nI should have known better. Asha knew how it went with little brothers. She remembered Theon as a boy, a shy child who lived in awe, and fear, of Rodrik and Maron. They never grow out of it, she decided. A little brother may live to be a hundred, but he will always be a little brother. She rattled her iron jewelry and imagined how pleasant it would be to step up behind Stannis and throttle him with the chain that bound her wrists.\nThey supped that night on a venison stew made from a scrawny hart that a scout called Benjicot Branch had brought down. But only in the royal tent. Beyond those canvas walls, each man got a heel of bread and a chunk of black sausage no longer than a finger, washed down with the last of Galbart Glover\u2019s ale.\nOne hundred leagues from Deepwood Motte to Winterfell. Three hundred miles as the raven flies. \u201cWould that we were ravens,\u201d Justin Massey said on the fourth day of the march, the day the snow began to fall. Only a few small flurries at first. Cold and wet, but nothing they could not push through easily.\nBut it snowed again the next day, and the day after, and the day after that. The thick beards of the wolves were soon caked with ice where their breath had frozen, and every clean-shaved southron boy was letting his whiskers grow out to keep his face warm. Before long the ground ahead of the column was blanketed in white, concealing stones and twisted roots and deadfalls, turning every step into an adventure. The wind picked up as well, driving the snow before it. The king\u2019s host became a column of snowmen, staggering through knee-high drifts.\nOn the third day of snow, the king\u2019s host began to come apart. Whilst the southron knights and lordlings struggled, the men of the northern hills fared better. Their garrons were sure-footed beasts that ate less than palfreys, and much less than the big destriers, and the men who rode them were at home in the snow. Many of the wolves donned curious footwear. Bear-paws, they called them, queer elongated things made with bent wood and leather strips. Lashed onto the bottoms of their boots, the things somehow allowed them to walk on top of the snow without breaking through the crust and sinking down to their thighs.\nSome had bear-paws for their horses too, and the shaggy little garrons wore them as easily as other mounts wore iron horseshoes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the palfreys and destriers wanted no part of them. When a few of the king\u2019s knights strapped them onto their feet nonetheless, the big southern horses balked and refused to move, or tried to shake the things off their feet. One destrier broke an ankle trying to walk in them.\nThe northmen on their bear-paws soon began to outdistance the rest of the host. They overtook the knights in the main column, then Ser Godry Farring and his vanguard. And meanwhile, the wayns and wagons of the baggage train were falling farther and farther behind, so much so that the men of the rear guard were constantly chivvying them to keep up a faster pace.\nOn the fifth day of the storm, the baggage train crossed a rippling expanse of waist-high snowdrifts that concealed a frozen pond. When the hidden ice cracked beneath the weight of the wagons, three teamsters and four horses were swallowed up by the freezing water, along with two of the men who tried to rescue them. One was Harwood Fell. His knights pulled him out before he drowned, but not before his lips turned blue and his skin as pale as milk. Nothing they did could seem to warm him afterward. He shivered violently for hours, even when they cut him out of his sodden clothes, wrapped him in warm furs, and sat him by the fire. That same night he slipped into a feverish sleep. He never woke.\nThat was the night that Asha first heard the queen\u2019s men muttering about a sacrifice\u2014an offering to their red god, so he might end the storm. \u201cThe gods of the north have unleashed this storm on us,\u201d Ser Corliss Penny said.\n\u201cFalse gods,\u201d insisted Ser Godry, the Giantslayer.\n\u201cR\u2019hllor is with us,\u201d said Ser Clayton Suggs.\n\u201cMelisandre is not,\u201d said Justin Massey.\nThe king said nothing. But he heard. Asha was certain of that. He sat at the high table as a dish of onion soup cooled before him, hardly tasted, staring at the flame of the nearest candle with those hooded eyes, ignoring the talk around him. The second-in-command, the lean tall knight named Richard Horpe, spoke for him. \u201cThe storm must break soon,\u201d he declared.\nBut the storm only worsened. The wind became a lash as cruel as any slaver\u2019s whip. Asha thought she had known cold on Pyke, when the wind came howling off the sea, but that was nothing compared to this. This is a cold that drives men mad.\nEven when the shout came down the line to make camp for the night, it was no easy thing to warm yourself. The tents were damp and heavy, hard to raise, harder to take down, and prone to sudden collapse if too much snow accumulated on top of them. The king\u2019s host was creeping through the heart of the largest forest in the Seven Kingdoms, yet dry wood became difficult to find. Every camp saw fewer fires burning, and those that were lit threw off more smoke than heat. Oft as not food was eaten cold, even raw.\nEven the nightfire shrank and grew feeble, to the dismay of the queen\u2019s men. \u201cLord of Light, preserve us from this evil,\u201d they prayed, led by the deep voice of Ser Godry the Giantslayer. \u201cShow us your bright sun again, still these winds, and melt these snows, that we may reach your foes and smite them. The night is dark and cold and full of terrors, but yours is the power and glory and the light. R\u2019hllor, fill us with your fire.\u201d\nLater, when Ser Corliss Penny wondered aloud whether an entire army had ever frozen to death in a winter storm, the wolves laughed. \u201cThis is no winter,\u201d declared Big Bucket Wull. \u201cUp in the hills we say that autumn kisses you, but winter fucks you hard. This is only autumn\u2019s kiss.\u201d\nGod grant that I never know true winter, then. Asha herself was spared the worst of it; she was the king\u2019s prize, after all. Whilst others hungered, she was fed. Whilst others shivered, she was warm. Whilst others struggled through the snows atop weary horses, she rode upon a bed of furs inside a wayn, with a stiff canvas roof to keep the snow off, comfortable in her chains.\nThe horses and the common men had it hardest. Two squires from the stormlands stabbed a man-at-arms to death in a quarrel over who would sit closest to the fire. The next night some archers desperate for warmth somehow managed to set their tent afire, which had at least the virtue of heating the adjacent tents. Destriers began to perish of exhaustion and exposure. \u201cWhat is a knight without a horse?\u201d men riddled. \u201cA snowman with a sword.\u201d Any horse that went down was butchered on the spot for meat. Their provisions had begun to run low as well.\nPeasebury, Cobb, Foxglove, and other southron lords urged the king to make camp until the storm had passed. Stannis would have none of that. Nor would he heed the queen\u2019s men when they came to urge him to make an offering to their hungry red god.\nThat tale she had from Justin Massey, who was less devout than most. \u201cA sacrifice will prove our faith still burns true, Sire,\u201d Clayton Suggs had told the king. And Godry the Giantslayer said, \u201cThe old gods of the north have sent this storm upon us. Only R\u2019hllor can end it. We must give him an unbeliever.\u201d\n\u201cHalf my army is made up of unbelievers,\u201d Stannis had replied. \u201cI will have no burnings. Pray harder.\u201d\nNo burnings today, and none tomorrow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if the snows continue, how long before the king\u2019s resolve begins to weaken? Asha had never shared her uncle Aeron\u2019s faith in the Drowned God, but that night she prayed as fervently to He Who Dwells Beneath the Waves as ever the Damphair had. The storm did not abate. The march continued, slowing to a stagger, then a crawl. Five miles was a good day. Then three. Then two.\nBy the ninth day of the storm, every camp saw the captains and commanders entering the king\u2019s tent wet and weary, to sink to one knee and report their losses for the day.\n\u201cOne man dead, three missing.\u201d\n\u201cSix horses lost, one of them mine own.\u201d\n\u201cTwo dead men, one a knight. Four horses down. We got one up again. The others are lost. Destriers, and one palfrey.\u201d\nThe cold count, Asha heard it named. The baggage train suffered the worst: dead horses, lost men, wayns overturned and broken. \u201cThe horses founder in the snow,\u201d Justin Massey told the king. \u201cMen wander off or just sit down to die.\u201d\n\u201cLet them,\u201d King Stannis snapped. \u201cWe press on.\u201d\nThe northmen fared much better, with their garrons and their bear-paws. Black Donnel Flint and his half-brother Artos only lost one man between them. The Liddles, the Wulls, and the Norreys lost none at all. One of Morgan Liddle\u2019s mules had gone astray, but he seemed to think the Flints had stolen him.\nOne hundred leagues from Deepwood Motte to Winterfell. Three hundred miles as the raven flies. Fifteen days. The fifteenth day of the march came and went, and they had crossed less than half the distance. A trail of broken wayns and frozen corpses stretched back behind them, buried beneath the blowing snow. The sun and moon and stars had been gone so long that Asha was starting to wonder whether she had dreamed them.\nIt was the twentieth day of the advance when she finally won free of her ankle chains. Late that afternoon, one of the horses drawing her wayn died in the traces. No replacement could be found; what draft horses remained were needed to pull the wagons that held their food and fodder. When Ser Justin Massey rode up, he told them to butcher the dead horse for meat and break up the wagon for firewood. Then he removed the fetters around Asha\u2019s ankles, rubbing the stiffness from her calves. \u201cI have no mount to give you, my lady,\u201d he said, \u201cand if we tried to ride double, it would be the end of my horse as well. You must walk.\u201d\nAsha\u2019s ankle throbbed beneath her weight with every step. The cold will numb it soon enough, she told herself. In an hour I won\u2019t feel my feet at all. She was only part wrong; it took less time than that. By the time darkness halted the column, she was stumbling and yearning for the comforts of her rolling prison. The irons made me weak. Supper found her so exhausted that she fell asleep at the table.\nOn the twenty-sixth day of the fifteen-day march, the last of the vegetables was consumed. On the thirty-second day, the last of the grain and fodder. Asha wondered how long a man could live on raw, half-frozen horse meat.\n\u201cBranch swears we are only three days from Winterfell,\u201d Ser Richard Horpe told the king that night after the cold count.\n\u201cIf we leave the weakest men behind,\u201d said Corliss Penny.\n\u201cThe weakest men are beyond saving,\u201d insisted Horpe. \u201cThose still strong enough must reach Winterfell or die as well.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord of Light will deliver us the castle,\u201d said Ser Godry Farring. \u201cIf Lady Melisandre were with us\u2014\u201d\nFinally, after a nightmarish day when the column advanced a bare mile and lost a dozen horses and four men, Lord Peasebury turned against the northmen. \u201cThis march was madness. More dying every day, and for what? Some girl?\u201d\n\u201cNed\u2019s girl,\u201d said Morgan Liddle. He was the second of three sons, so the other wolves called him Middle Liddle, though not often in his hearing. It was Morgan who had almost slain Asha in the fight by Deepwood Motte. He had come to her later, on the march, to beg her pardon\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for calling her cunt in his battle lust, not for trying to split her head open with an axe.\n\u201cNed\u2019s girl,\u201d echoed Big Bucket Wull. \u201cAnd we should have had her and the castle both if you prancing southron jackanapes didn\u2019t piss your satin breeches at a little snow.\u201d\n\u201cA little snow?\u201d Peasebury\u2019s soft girlish mouth twisted in fury. \u201cYour ill counsel forced this march upon us, Wull. I am starting to suspect you have been Bolton\u2019s creature all along. Is that the way of it? Did he send you to us to whisper poison in the king\u2019s ear?\u201d\nBig Bucket laughed in his face. \u201cLord Pea Pod. If you were a man, I would kill you for that, but my sword is made of too fine a steel to besmirch with craven\u2019s blood.\u201d He took a drink of ale and wiped his mouth. \u201cAye, men are dying. More will die before we see Winterfell. What of it? This is war. Men die in war. That is as it should be. As it has always been.\u201d\nSer Corliss Penny gave the clan chief an incredulous look. \u201cDo you want to die, Wull?\u201d\nThat seemed to amuse the northman. \u201cI want to live forever in a land where summer lasts a thousand years. I want a castle in the clouds where I can look down over the world. I want to be six-and-twenty again. When I was six-and-twenty I could fight all day and fuck all night. What men want does not matter.\n\u201cWinter is almost upon us, boy. And winter is death. I would sooner my men die fighting for the Ned\u2019s little girl than alone and hungry in the snow, weeping tears that freeze upon their cheeks. No one sings songs of men who die like that. As for me, I am old. This will be my last winter. Let me bathe in Bolton blood before I die. I want to feel it spatter across my face when my axe bites deep into a Bolton skull. I want to lick it off my lips and die with the taste of it on my tongue.\u201d\n\u201cAye!\u201d shouted Morgan Liddle. \u201cBlood and battle!\u201d Then all the hillmen were shouting, banging their cups and drinking horns on the table, filling the king\u2019s tent with the clangor.\nAsha Greyjoy would have welcomed a fight herself. One battle, to put an end to this misery. Steel on steel, pink snow, broken shields and severed limbs, and it would all be done.\nThe next day the king\u2019s scouts chanced upon an abandoned crofters\u2019 village between two lakes\u2014a mean and meagre place, no more than a few huts, a longhall, and a watchtower. Richard Horpe commanded a halt, though the army had advanced no more than a half-mile that day and they were hours shy of dark. It was well past moonrise before the baggage train and rear guard straggled in. Asha was amongst them.\n\u201cThere are fish in those lakes,\u201d Horpe told the king. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut holes in the ice. The northmen know how it\u2019s done.\u201d\nEven in his bulky fur cloak and heavy armor, Stannis looked like a man with one foot in the grave. What little flesh he\u2019d carried on his tall, spare frame at Deepwood Motte had melted away during the march. The shape of his skull could be seen under his skin, and his jaw was clenched so hard Asha feared his teeth might shatter. \u201cFish, then,\u201d he said, biting off each word with a snap. \u201cBut we march at first light.\u201d\nYet when light came, the camp woke to snow and silence. The sky turned from black to white, and seemed no brighter. Asha Greyjoy awoke cramped and cold beneath the pile of sleeping furs, listening to the She-Bear\u2019s snores. She had never known a woman to snore so loudly, but she had grown used to it whilst on the march, and even took some comfort in it now. It was the silence that troubled her. No trumpets blew to rouse the men to mount up, form column, prepare to march. No warhorns summoned forth the northmen. Something is wrong.\nAsha crawled out from under her sleeping furs and pushed her way out of the tent, knocking aside the wall of snow that had sealed them in during the night. Her irons clanked as she climbed to her feet and took a breath of the icy morning air. The snow was still falling, even more heavily than when she\u2019d crawled inside the tent. The lakes had vanished, and the woods as well. She could see the shapes of other tents and lean-tos and the fuzzy orange glow of the beacon fire burning atop the watchtower, but not the tower itself. The storm had swallowed the rest.\nSomewhere ahead Roose Bolton awaited them behind the walls of Winterfell, but Stannis Baratheon\u2019s host sat snowbound and unmoving, walled in by ice and snow, starving.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe candle was almost gone. Less than an inch remained, jutting from a pool of warm melted wax to cast its light over the queen\u2019s bed. The flame had begun to gutter.\nIt will go out before much longer, Dany realized, and when it does another night will be at its end.\nDawn always came too soon.\nShe had not slept, could not sleep, would not sleep. She had not even dared to close her eyes, for fear it would be morning when she opened them again. If only she had the power, she would have made their nights go on forever, but the best that she could do was stay awake to try and savor every last sweet moment before daybreak turned them into no more than fading memories.\nBeside her, Daario Naharis was sleeping as peacefully as a newborn babe. He had a gift for sleeping, he\u2019d boasted, smiling in that cocksure way of his. In the field, he would sleep in the saddle oft as not, he claimed, so as to be well rested should he come upon a battle. Sun or storm, it made no matter. \u201cA warrior who cannot sleep soon has no strength to fight,\u201d he said. He was never vexed by nightmares either. When Dany told him how Serwyn of the Mirror Shield was haunted by the ghosts of all the knights he\u2019d killed, Daario only laughed. \u201cIf the ones I killed come bother me, I will kill them all again.\u201d He has a sellsword\u2019s conscience, she realized then. That is to say, none at all.\nDaario lay upon his stomach, the light linen coverlets tangled about his long legs, his face half-buried in the pillows.\nDany ran her hand down his back, tracing the line of his spine. His skin was smooth beneath her touch, almost hairless. His skin is silk and satin. She loved the feel of him beneath her fingers. She loved to run her fingers through his hair, to knead the ache from his calves after a long day in the saddle, to cup his cock and feel it harden against her palm.\nIf she had been some ordinary woman, she would gladly have spent her whole life touching Daario, tracing his scars and making him tell her how he\u2019d come by every one. I would give up my crown if he asked it of me, Dany thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he had not asked it, and never would. Daario might whisper words of love when the two of them were as one, but she knew it was the dragon queen he loved. If I gave up my crown, he would not want me. Besides, kings who lost their crowns oft lost their heads as well, and she could see no reason why it would be any different for a queen.\nThe candle flickered one last time and died, drowned in its own wax. Darkness swallowed the feather bed and its two occupants, and filled every corner of the chamber. Dany wrapped her arms around her captain and pressed herself against his back. She drank in the scent of him, savoring the warmth of his flesh, the feel of his skin against her own. Remember, she told herself. Remember how he felt. She kissed him on his shoulder.\nDaario rolled toward her, his eyes open. \u201cDaenerys.\u201d He smiled a lazy smile. That was another of his talents; he woke all at once, like a cat. \u201cIs it dawn?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. We have a while still.\u201d\n\u201cLiar. I can see your eyes. Could I do that if it were the black of night?\u201d Daario kicked loose of the coverlets and sat up. \u201cThe half-light. Day will be here soon.\u201d\n\u201cI do not want this night to end.\u201d\n\u201cNo? And why is that, my queen?\u201d\n\u201cYou know.\u201d\n\u201cThe wedding?\u201d He laughed. \u201cMarry me instead.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I cannot do that.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a queen. You can do what you like.\u201d He slid a hand along her leg. \u201cHow many nights remain to us?\u201d\nTwo. Only two. \u201cYou know as well as I. This night and the next, and we must end this.\u201d\n\u201cMarry me, and we can have all the nights forever.\u201d\nIf I could, I would. Khal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars, but he had been dead so long that Daenerys had almost forgotten how it felt to love and be loved. Daario had helped her to remember. I was dead and he brought me back to life. I was asleep and he woke me. My brave captain. Even so, of late he grew too bold. On the day that he returned from his latest sortie, he had tossed the head of a Yunkish lord at her feet and kissed her in the hall for all the world to see, until Barristan Selmy pulled the two of them apart. Ser Grandfather had been so wroth that Dany feared blood might be shed. \u201cWe cannot wed, my love. You know why.\u201d\nHe climbed from her bed. \u201cMarry Hizdahr, then. I will give him a nice set of horns for his wedding gift. Ghiscari men like to prance about in horns. They make them from their own hair, with combs and wax and irons.\u201d Daario found his breeches and pulled them on. He did not trouble himself with smallclothes.\n\u201cOnce I am wed it will be high treason to desire me.\u201d Dany pulled the coverlet up over her breasts.\n\u201cThen I must be a traitor.\u201d He slipped a blue silk tunic over his head and straightened the prongs of his beard with his fingers. He had dyed it afresh for her, taking it from purple back to blue, as it had been when first she met him. \u201cI smell of you,\u201d he said, sniffing at his fingers and grinning.\nDany loved the way his gold tooth gleamed when he grinned. She loved the fine hairs on his chest. She loved the strength in his arms, the sound of his laughter, the way he would always look into her eyes and say her name as he slid his cock inside her. \u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d she blurted as she watched him don his riding boots and lace them up. Some days he let her do that for him, but not today, it seemed. That\u2019s done with too.\n\u201cNot beautiful enough to marry.\u201d Daario took his sword belt off the peg where he had hung it.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cOut into your city,\u201d he said, \u201cto drink a keg or two and pick a quarrel. It has been too long since I\u2019ve killed a man. Might be I should seek out your betrothed.\u201d\nDany threw a pillow at him. \u201cYou will leave Hizdahr be!\u201d\n\u201cAs my queen commands. Will you hold court today?\u201d\n\u201cNo. On the morrow I will be a woman wed, and Hizdahr will be king. Let him hold court. These are his people.\u201d\n\u201cSome are his, some are yours. The ones you freed.\u201d\n\u201cAre you chiding me?\u201d\n\u201cThe ones you call your children. They want their mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou are. You are chiding me.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a little, bright heart. Will you come hold court?\u201d\n\u201cAfter my wedding, perhaps. After the peace.\u201d\n\u201cThis after that you speak of never comes. You should hold court. My new men do not believe that you are real. The ones who came over from the Windblown. Bred and born in Westeros, most of them, full of tales about Targaryens. They want to see one with their own eyes. The Frog has a gift for you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Frog?\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cAnd who is he?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cSome Dornish boy. He squires for the big knight they call Greenguts. I told him he could give his gift to me and I\u2019d deliver it, but he wouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, a clever frog. \u2018Give the gift to me.\u2019 \u201d She threw the other pillow at him. \u201cWould I have ever seen it?\u201d\nDaario stroked his gilded mustachio. \u201cWould I steal from my sweet queen? If it were a gift worthy of you, I would have put it into your soft hands myself.\u201d\n\u201cAs a token of your love?\u201d\n\u201cAs to that I will not say, but I told him that he could give it to you. You would not make a liar of Daario Naharis?\u201d Dany was helpless to refuse. \u201cAs you wish. Bring your frog to court tomorrow. The others too. The Westerosi.\u201d It would be nice to hear the Common Tongue from someone besides Ser Barristan.\n\u201cAs my queen commands.\u201d Daario bowed deeply, grinned, and took his leave, his cloak swirling behind him.\nDany sat amongst the rumpled bedclothes with her arms about her knees, so forlorn that she did not hear when Missandei came creeping in with bread and milk and figs. \u201cYour Grace? Are you unwell? In the black of night this one heard you scream.\u201d\nDany took a fig. It was black and plump, still moist with dew. Will Hizdahr ever make me scream? \u201cIt was the wind that you heard screaming.\u201d She took a bite, but the fruit had lost its savor now that Daario was gone. Sighing, she rose and called to Irri for a robe, then wandered out onto her terrace.\nHer foes were all about her. There were never less than a dozen ships drawn up on the shore. Some days there were as many as a hundred, when the soldiers were disembarking. The Yunkai\u2019i were even bringing in wood by sea. Behind their ditches, they were building catapults, scorpions, tall trebuchets. On still nights she could hear the hammers ringing through the warm, dry air. No siege towers, though. No battering rams. They would not try to take Meereen by storm. They would wait behind their siege lines, flinging stones at her until famine and disease had brought her people to their knees.\nHizdahr will bring me peace. He must.\nThat night her cooks roasted her a kid with dates and carrots, but Dany could only eat a bite of it. The prospect of wrestling with Meereen once more left her feeling weary. Sleep came hard, even when Daario came back, so drunk that he could hardly stand. Beneath her coverlets she tossed and turned, dreaming that Hizdahr was kissing her\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but his lips were blue and bruised, and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice. She sat up with her hair disheveled and the bedclothes atangle. Her captain slept beside her, yet she was alone. She wanted to shake him, wake him, make him hold her, fuck her, help her forget, but she knew that if she did, he would only smile and yawn and say, \u201cIt was just a dream, my queen. Go back to sleep.\u201d\nInstead she slipped into a hooded robe and stepped out onto her terrace. She went to the parapet and stood there gazing down upon the city as she had done a hundred times before. It will never be my city. It will never be my home.\nThe pale pink light of dawn found her still out on her terrace, asleep upon the grass beneath a blanket of fine dew. \u201cI promised Daario that I would hold court today,\u201d Daenerys told her handmaids when they woke her. \u201cHelp me find my crown. Oh, and some clothes to wear, something light and cool.\u201d\nShe made her descent an hour later. \u201cAll kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles and Mother of Dragons,\u201d Missandei called.\nReznak mo Reznak bowed and beamed. \u201cMagnificence, every day you grow more beautiful. I think the prospect of your wedding has given you a glow. Oh, my shining queen!\u201d\nDany sighed. \u201cSummon the first petitioner.\u201d\nIt had been so long since she last held court that the crush of cases was almost overwhelming. The back of the hall was a solid press of people, and scuffles broke out over precedence. Inevitably it was Galazza Galare who stepped forward, her head held high, her face hidden behind a shimmering green veil. \u201cYour Radiance, it might be best were we to speak in private.\u201d\n\u201cWould that I had the time,\u201d said Dany sweetly. \u201cI am to be wed upon the morrow.\u201d Her last meeting with the Green Grace had not gone well. \u201cWhat would you have of me?\u201d\n\u201cI would speak to you about the presumption of a certain sellsword captain.\u201d\nShe dares say that in open court? Dany felt a blaze of anger. She has courage, I grant that, but if she thinks I am about to suffer another scolding, she could not be more wrong. \u201cThe treachery of Brown Ben Plumm has shocked us all,\u201d she said, \u201cbut your warning comes too late. And now I know you will want to return to your temple to pray for peace.\u201d\nThe Green Grace bowed. \u201cI shall pray for you as well.\u201d\nAnother slap, thought Dany, color rising to her face.\nThe rest was a tedium the queen knew well. She sat upon her cushions, listening, one foot jiggling with impatience. Jhiqui brought a platter of figs and ham at midday. There seemed to be no end to the petitioners. For every two she sent off smiling, one left red-eyed or muttering.\nIt was close to sunset before Daario Naharis appeared with his new Stormcrows, the Westerosi who had come over to him from the Windblown. Dany found herself glancing at them as yet another petitioner droned on and on. These are my people. I am their rightful queen. They seemed a scruffy bunch, but that was only to be expected of sellswords. The youngest could not have been more than a year older than her; the oldest must have seen sixty namedays. A few sported signs of wealth: gold arm rings, silken tunics, silver-studded sword belts. Plunder. For the most part, their clothes were plainly made and showed signs of hard wear.\nWhen Daario brought them forward, she saw that one of them was a woman, big and blond and all in mail. \u201cPretty Meris,\u201d her captain named her, though pretty was the last thing Dany would have called her. She was six feet tall and earless, with a slit nose, deep scars in both cheeks, and the coldest eyes the queen had ever seen. As for the rest\u00a0\u2026\nHugh Hungerford was slim and saturnine, long-legged, long-faced, clad in faded finery. Webber was short and muscular, with spiders tattooed across his head and chest and arms. Red-faced Orson Stone claimed to be a knight, as did lanky Lucifer Long. Will of the Woods leered at her even as he took a knee. Dick Straw had cornflower-blue eyes, hair as white as flax, and an unsettling smile. Ginger Jack\u2019s face was hidden behind a bristly orange beard, and his speech was unintelligible. \u201cHe bit off half his tongue in his first battle,\u201d Hungerford explained to her.\nThe Dornishmen seemed different. \u201cIf it please Your Grace,\u201d said Daario, \u201cthese three are Greenguts, Gerrold, and Frog.\u201d\nGreenguts was huge and bald as a stone, with arms thick enough to rival even Strong Belwas. Gerrold was a lean, tall youth with sun streaks in his hair and laughing blue-green eyes. That smile has won many a maiden\u2019s heart, I\u2019ll wager. His cloak was made of soft brown wool lined with sandsilk, a goodly garment.\nFrog, the squire, was the youngest of the three, and the least impressive, a solemn, stocky lad, brown of hair and eye. His face was squarish, with a high forehead, heavy jaw, and broad nose. The stubble on his cheeks and chin made him look like a boy trying to grow his first beard. Dany had no inkling why anyone would call him Frog. Perhaps he can jump farther than the others.\n\u201cYou may rise,\u201d she said. \u201cDaario tells me you come to us from Dorne. Dornishmen will always have a welcome at my court. Sunspear stayed loyal to my father when the Usurper stole his throne. You must have faced many perils to reach me.\u201d\n\u201cToo many,\u201d said Gerrold, the handsome one with the sun-streaked hair. \u201cWe were six when we left Dorne, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry for your losses.\u201d The queen turned to his large companion. \u201cGreenguts is a queer sort of name.\u201d\n\u201cA jape, Your Grace. From the ships. I was greensick the whole way from Volantis. Heaving and\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, I shouldn\u2019t say.\u201d\nDany giggled. \u201cI think that I can guess, ser. It is ser, is it not? Daario tells me that you are a knight.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please Your Grace, we are all three knights.\u201d\nDany glanced at Daario and saw anger flash across his face. He did not know. \u201cI have need of knights,\u201d she said.\nSer Barristan\u2019s suspicions had awakened. \u201cKnighthood is easily claimed this far from Westeros. Are you prepared to defend that boast with sword or lance?\u201d\n\u201cIf need be,\u201d said Gerrold, \u201cthough I will not claim that any of us is the equal of Barristan the Bold. Your Grace, I beg your pardon, but we have come before you under false names.\u201d\n\u201cI knew someone else who did that once,\u201d said Dany, \u201ca man called Arstan Whitebeard. Tell me your true names, then.\u201d\n\u201cGladly\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if we may beg the queen\u2019s indulgence, is there some place with fewer eyes and ears?\u201d\nGames within games. \u201cAs you wish. Skahaz, clear my court.\u201d\nThe Shavepate roared out orders. His Brazen Beasts did the rest, herding the other Westerosi and the rest of the day\u2019s petitioners from the hall. Her counselors remained.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Dany said, \u201cyour names.\u201d\nHandsome young Gerrold bowed. \u201cSer Gerris Drinkwater, Your Grace. My sword is yours.\u201d\nGreenguts crossed his arms against his chest. \u201cAnd my warhammer. I\u2019m Ser Archibald Yronwood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, ser?\u201d the queen asked the boy called Frog.\n\u201cIf it please Your Grace, may I first present my gift?\u201d\n\u201cIf you wish,\u201d Daenerys said, curious, but as Frog started forward Daario Naharis stepped in front of him and held out a gloved hand. \u201cGive this gift to me.\u201d\nStone-faced, the stocky lad bent, unlaced his boot, and drew a yellowed parchment from a hidden flap within.\n\u201cThis is your gift? A scrap of writing?\u201d Daario snatched the parchment out of the Dornishman\u2019s hands and unrolled it, squinting at the seals and signatures. \u201cVery pretty, all the gold and ribbons, but I do not read your Westerosi scratchings.\u201d\n\u201cBring it to the queen,\u201d Ser Barristan commanded. \u201cNow.\u201d\nDany could feel the anger in the hall. \u201cI am only a young girl, and young girls must have their gifts,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cDaario, please, you must not tease me. Give it here.\u201d\nThe parchment was written in the Common Tongue. The queen unrolled it slowly, studying the seals and signatures. When she saw the name Ser Willem Darry, her heart beat a little faster. She read it over once, and then again.\n\u201cMay we know what it says, Your Grace?\u201d asked Ser Barristan.\n\u201cIt is a secret pact,\u201d Dany said, \u201cmade in Braavos when I was just a little girl. Ser Willem Darry signed for us, the man who spirited my brother and myself away from Dragonstone before the Usurper\u2019s men could take us. Prince Oberyn Martell signed for Dorne, with the Sealord of Braavos as witness.\u201d She handed the parchment to Ser Barristan, so he might read it for himself. \u201cThe alliance is to be sealed by a marriage, it says. In return for Dorne\u2019s help overthrowing the Usurper, my brother Viserys is to take Prince Doran\u2019s daughter Arianne for his queen.\u201d\nThe old knight read the pact slowly. \u201cIf Robert had known of this, he would have smashed Sunspear as he once smashed Pyke, and claimed the heads of Prince Doran and the Red Viper\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and like as not, the head of this Dornish princess too.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt that was why Prince Doran chose to keep the pact a secret,\u201d suggested Daenerys. \u201cIf my brother Viserys had known that he had a Dornish princess waiting for him, he would have crossed to Sunspear as soon as he was old enough to wed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thereby brought Robert\u2019s warhammer down upon himself, and Dorne as well,\u201d said Frog. \u201cMy father was content to wait for the day that Prince Viserys found his army.\u201d\n\u201cYour father?\u201d\n\u201cPrince Doran.\u201d He sank back onto one knee. \u201cYour Grace, I have the honor to be Quentyn Martell, a prince of Dorne and your most leal subject.\u201d\nDany laughed.\nThe Dornish prince flushed red, whilst her own court and counselors gave her puzzled looks. \u201cRadiance?\u201d said Skahaz Shavepate, in the Ghiscari tongue. \u201cWhy do you laugh?\u201d\n\u201cThey call him frog,\u201d she said, \u201cand we have just learned why. In the Seven Kingdoms there are children\u2019s tales of frogs who turn into enchanted princes when kissed by their true love.\u201d Smiling at the Dornish knights, she switched back to the Common Tongue. \u201cTell me, Prince Quentyn, are you enchanted?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cI feared as much.\u201d Neither enchanted nor enchanting, alas. A pity he\u2019s the prince, and not the one with the wide shoulders and the sandy hair. \u201cYou have come for a kiss, however. You mean to marry me. Is that the way of it? The gift you bring me is your own sweet self. Instead of Viserys and your sister, you and I must seal this pact if I want Dorne.\u201d\n\u201cMy father hoped that you might find me acceptable.\u201d\nDaario Naharis gave a scornful laugh. \u201cI say you are a pup. The queen needs a man beside her, not a mewling boy. You are no fit husband for a woman such as her. When you lick your lips, do you still taste your mother\u2019s milk?\u201d\nSer Gerris Drinkwater darkened at his words. \u201cMind your tongue, sellsword. You are speaking to a prince of Dorne.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to his wet nurse, I am thinking.\u201d Daario brushed his thumbs across his sword hilts and smiled dangerously.\nSkahaz scowled, as only he could scowl. \u201cThis boy might serve for Dorne, but Meereen needs a king of Ghiscari blood.\u201d\n\u201cI know of this Dorne,\u201d said Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cDorne is sand and scorpions, and bleak red mountains baking in the sun.\u201d\nPrince Quentyn answered him. \u201cDorne is fifty thousand spears and swords, pledged to our queen\u2019s service.\u201d\n\u201cFifty thousand?\u201d mocked Daario. \u201cI count three.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Daenerys said. \u201cPrince Quentyn has crossed half the world to offer me his gift, I will not have him treated with discourtesy.\u201d She turned to the Dornishmen. \u201cWould that you had come a year ago. I am pledged to wed the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq.\u201d\nSer Gerris said, \u201cIt is not too late\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will be the judge of that,\u201d Daenerys said. \u201cReznak, see that the prince and his companions are given quarters suitable to their high birth, and that their wants are attended to.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, Your Radiance.\u201d\nThe queen rose. \u201cThen we are done for now.\u201d\nDaario and Ser Barristan followed her up the steps to her apartments. \u201cThis changes everything,\u201d the old knight said.\n\u201cThis changes nothing,\u201d Dany said, as Irri removed her crown. \u201cWhat good are three men?\u201d\n\u201cThree knights,\u201d said Selmy.\n\u201cThree liars,\u201d Daario said darkly. \u201cThey deceived me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd bought you too, I do not doubt.\u201d He did not trouble to deny it. Dany unrolled the parchment and examined it again. Braavos. This was done in Braavos, while we were living in the house with the red door. Why did that make her feel so strange?\nShe found herself remembering her nightmare. Sometimes there is truth in dreams. Could Hizdahr zo Loraq be working for the warlocks, was that what the dream had meant? Could the dream have been a sending? Were the gods telling her to put Hizdahr aside and wed this Dornish prince instead? Something tickled at her memory. \u201cSer Barristan, what are the arms of House Martell?\u201d\n\u201cA sun in splendor, transfixed by a spear.\u201d\nThe sun\u2019s son. A shiver went through her. \u201cShadows and whispers.\u201d What else had Quaithe said? The pale mare and the sun\u2019s son. There was a lion in it too, and a dragon. Or am I the dragon? \u201cBeware the perfumed seneschal.\u201d That she remembered. \u201cDreams and prophecies. Why must they always be in riddles? I hate this. Oh, leave me, ser. Tomorrow is my wedding day.\u201d\nThat night Daario had her every way a man can have a woman, and she gave herself to him willingly. The last time, as the sun was coming up, she used her mouth to make him hard again, as Doreah had taught her long ago, then rode him so wildly that his wound began to bleed again, and for one sweet heartbeat she could not tell whether he was inside of her, or her inside of him.\nBut when the sun rose upon her wedding day so did Daario Naharis, donning his clothes and buckling on his sword belt with its gleaming golden wantons. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Dany asked him. \u201cI forbid you to make a sortie today.\u201d\n\u201cMy queen is cruel,\u201d her captain said. \u201cIf I cannot slay your foes, how shall I amuse myself whilst you are being wed?\u201d\n\u201cBy nightfall I shall have no foes.\u201d\n\u201cIt is only dawn, sweet queen. The day is long. Time enough for one last sortie. I will bring you back the head of Brown Ben Plumm for a wedding gift.\u201d\n\u201cNo heads,\u201d Dany insisted. \u201cOnce you brought me flowers.\u201d\n\u201cLet Hizdahr bring you flowers. He is not one to stoop and pluck a dandelion, true, but he has servants who will be pleased to do it for him. Do I have your leave to go?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She wanted him to stay and hold her. One day he will go and not return, she thought. One day some archer will put an arrow through his chest, or ten men will fall on him with spears and swords and axes, ten would-be heroes. Five of them would die, but that would not make her grief easier to bear. One day I will lose him, as I lost my sun-and-stars. But please gods, not today. \u201cCome back to bed and kiss me.\u201d No one had ever kissed her like Daario Naharis. \u201cI am your queen, and I command you to fuck me.\u201d\nShe had meant it playfully, but Daario\u2019s eyes hardened at her words. \u201cFucking queens is king\u2019s work. Your noble Hizdahr can attend to that, once you\u2019re wed. And if he proves to be too highborn for such sweaty work, he has servants who will be pleased to do that for him as well. Or perhaps you can call the Dornish boy into your bed, and his pretty friend as well, why not?\u201d He strode from the bedchamber.\nHe is going to make a sortie, Dany realized, and if he takes Ben Plumm\u2019s head, he\u2019ll walk into the wedding feast and throw it at my feet. Seven save me. Why couldn\u2019t he be better born?\nWhen he was gone, Missandei brought the queen a simple meal of goat cheese and olives, with raisins for a sweet. \u201cYour Grace needs more than wine to break her fast. You are such a tiny thing, and you will surely need your strength today.\u201d\nThat made Daenerys laugh, coming from a girl so small. She relied so much on the little scribe that she oft forgot that Missandei had only turned eleven. They shared the food together on her terrace. As Dany nibbled on an olive, the Naathi girl gazed at her with eyes like molten gold and said, \u201cIt is not too late to tell them that you have decided not to wed.\u201d\nIt is, though, the queen thought, sadly. \u201cHizdahr\u2019s blood is ancient and noble. Our joining will join my freedmen to his people. When we become as one, so will our city.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace does not love the noble Hizdahr. This one thinks you would sooner have another for your husband.\u201d\nI must not think of Daario today. \u201cA queen loves where she must, not where she will.\u201d Her appetite had left her. \u201cTake this food away,\u201d she told Missandei. \u201cIt is time I bathed.\u201d\nAfterward, as Jhiqui was patting Daenerys dry, Irri approached with her tokar. Dany envied the Dothraki maids their loose sandsilk trousers and painted vests. They would be much cooler than her in her tokar, with its heavy fringe of baby pearls. \u201cHelp me wind this round myself, please. I cannot manage all these pearls by myself.\u201d\nShe should be eager with anticipation for her wedding and the night that would follow, she knew. She remembered the night of her first wedding, when Khal Drogo had claimed her maidenhead beneath the stranger stars. She remembered how frightened she had been, and how excited. Would it be the same with Hizdahr? No. I am not the girl I was, and he is not my sun-and-stars.\nMissandei reemerged from inside the pyramid. \u201cReznak and Skahaz beg the honor of escorting Your Grace to the Temple of the Graces. Reznak has ordered your palanquin made ready.\u201d\nMeereenese seldom rode within their city walls. They preferred palanquins, litters, and sedan chairs, borne upon the shoulders of their slaves. \u201cHorses befoul the streets,\u201d one man of Zakh had told her, \u201cslaves do not.\u201d Dany had freed the slaves, yet palanquins, litters, and sedan chairs still choked the streets as before, and none of them floated magically through the air.\n\u201cThe day is too hot to be shut up in a palanquin,\u201d said Dany. \u201cHave my silver saddled. I would not go to my lord husband upon the backs of bearers.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Missandei, \u201cthis one is so sorry, but you cannot ride in a tokar.\u201d\nThe little scribe was right, as she so often was. The tokar was not a garment meant for horseback. Dany made a face. \u201cAs you say. Not the palanquin, though. I would suffocate behind those drapes. Have them ready a sedan chair.\u201d If she must wear her floppy ears, let all the rabbits see her.\nWhen Dany made her descent, Reznak and Skahaz dropped to their knees. \u201cYour Worship shines so brightly, you will blind every man who dares to look upon you,\u201d said Reznak. The seneschal wore a tokar of maroon samite with golden fringes. \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq is most fortunate in you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and you in him, if I may be so bold as to say. This match will save our city, you will see.\u201d\n\u201cSo we pray. I want to plant my olive trees and see them fruit.\u201d Does it matter that Hizdahr\u2019s kisses do not please me? Peace will please me. Am I a queen or just a woman?\n\u201cThe crowds will be thick as flies today.\u201d The Shavepate was clad in a pleated black skirt and a muscled breastplate, with a brazen helm shaped like a serpent\u2019s head beneath one arm.\n\u201cShould I be afraid of flies? Your Brazen Beasts will keep me safe from any harm.\u201d\nIt was always dusk inside the base of the Great Pyramid. Walls thirty feet thick muffled the tumult of the streets and kept the heat outside, so it was cool and dim within. Her escort was forming up inside the gates. Horses, mules, and donkeys were stabled in the western walls, elephants in the eastern. Dany had acquired three of those huge, queer beasts with her pyramid. They reminded her of hairless grey mammoths, though their tusks had been bobbed and gilded, and their eyes were sad.\nShe found Strong Belwas eating grapes, as Barristan Selmy watched a stableboy cinch the girth on his dapple grey. The three Dornishmen were with him, talking, but they broke off when the queen appeared. Their prince went to one knee. \u201cYour Grace, I must entreat you. My father\u2019s strength is failing, but his devotion to your cause is as strong as ever. If my manner or my person have displeased you, that is my sorrow, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you would please me, ser, be happy for me,\u201d Daenerys said. \u201cThis is my wedding day. They will be dancing in the Yellow City, I do not doubt.\u201d She sighed. \u201cRise, my prince, and smile. One day I shall return to Westeros to claim my father\u2019s throne, and look to Dorne for help. But on this day the Yunkai\u2019i have my city ringed in steel. I may die before I see my Seven Kingdoms. Hizdahr may die. Westeros may be swallowed by the waves.\u201d Dany kissed his cheek. \u201cCome. It\u2019s time I wed.\u201d\nSer Barristan helped her up onto her sedan chair. Quentyn rejoined his fellow Dornishmen. Strong Belwas bellowed for the gates to be opened, and Daenerys Targaryen was carried forth into the sun. Selmy fell in beside her on his dapple grey.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Dany said, as the procession turned toward the Temple of the Graces, \u201cif my father and my mother had been free to follow their own hearts, whom would they have wed?\u201d\n\u201cIt was long ago. Your Grace would not know them.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, though. Tell me.\u201d\nThe old knight inclined his head. \u201cThe queen your mother was always mindful of her duty.\u201d He was handsome in his gold-and-silver armor, his white cloak streaming from his shoulders, but he sounded like a man in pain, as if every word were a stone he had to pass. \u201cAs a girl, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who wore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to this knight?\u201d\n\u201cHe put away his lance the day your lady mother wed your father. Afterward he became most pious, and was heard to say that only the Maiden could replace Queen Rhaella in his heart. His passion was impossible, of course. A landed knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood.\u201d\nAnd Daario Naharis is only a sellsword, not fit to buckle on the golden spurs of even a landed knight. \u201cAnd my father? Was there some woman he loved better than his queen?\u201d\nSer Barristan shifted in the saddle. \u201cNot\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not loved. Mayhaps wanted is a better word, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it was only kitchen gossip, the whispers of washerwomen and stableboys\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI want to know. I never knew my father. I want to know everything about him. The good and\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the rest.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d The white knight chose his words with care. \u201cPrince Aerys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord\u2019s right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the liberties your father took during the bedding.\u201d His face reddened. \u201cI have said too much, Your Grace. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGracious queen, well met!\u201d Another procession had come up beside her own, and Hizdahr zo Loraq was smiling at her from his own sedan chair. My king. Dany wondered where Daario Naharis was, what he was doing. If this were a story, he would gallop up just as we reached the temple, to challenge Hizdahr for my hand.\nSide by side the queen\u2019s procession and Hizdahr zo Loraq\u2019s made their slow way across Meereen, until finally the Temple of the Graces loomed up before them, its golden domes flashing in the sun. How beautiful, the queen tried to tell herself, but inside her was some foolish little girl who could not help but look about for Daario. If he loved you, he would come and carry you off at swordpoint, as Rhaegar carried off his northern girl, the girl in her insisted, but the queen knew that was folly. Even if her captain was mad enough to attempt it, the Brazen Beasts would cut him down before he got within a hundred yards of her.\nGalazza Galare awaited them outside the temple doors, surrounded by her sisters in white and pink and red, blue and gold and purple. There are fewer than there were. Dany looked for Ezzara and did not see her. Has the bloody flux taken even her? Though the queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the bloody flux from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless. Many had been stricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, though as yet none of the Unsullied had been touched. She prayed the worst was past.\nThe Graces brought forth an ivory chair and a golden bowl. Holding her tokar daintily so as not to tread upon its fringes, Daenerys Targaryen eased herself onto the chair\u2019s plush velvet seat, and Hizdahr zo Loraq went to his knees, unlaced her sandals, and washed her feet whilst fifty eunuchs sang and ten thousand eyes looked on. He has gentle hands, she mused, as warm fragrant oils ran between her toes. If he has a gentle heart as well, I may grow fond of him in time.\nWhen her feet were clean, Hizdahr dried them with a soft towel, laced her sandals on again, and helped her stand. Hand in hand, they followed the Green Grace inside the temple, where the air was thick with incense and the gods of Ghis stood cloaked in shadows in their alcoves.\nFour hours later, they emerged again as man and wife, bound together wrist and ankle with chains of yellow gold.",

      "content": "JON\nQueen Selyse descended upon Castle Black with her daughter and her daughter\u2019s fool, her serving girls and lady companions, and a retinue of knights, sworn swords, and men-at-arms fifty strong. Queen\u2019s men all, Jon Snow knew. They may attend Selyse, but it is Melisandre they serve. The red priestess had warned him of their coming almost a day before the raven arrived from Eastwatch with the same message.\nHe met the queen\u2019s party by the stables, accompanied by Satin, Bowen Marsh, and half a dozen guards in long black cloaks. It would never do to come before this queen without a retinue of his own, if half of what they said of her was true. She might mistake him for a stableboy and hand him the reins of her horse.\nThe snows had finally moved off to the south and given them a respite. There was even a hint of warmth in the air as Jon Snow took a knee before this southron queen. \u201cYour Grace. Castle Black welcomes you and yours.\u201d\nQueen Selyse looked down at him. \u201cMy thanks. Please escort me to your lord commander.\u201d\n\u201cMy brothers chose me for that honor. I am Jon Snow.\u201d\n\u201cYou? They said you were young, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d Queen Selyse\u2019s face was pinched and pale. She wore a crown of red gold with points in the shape of flames, a twin to that worn by Stannis. \u201c\u2026\u00a0you may rise, Lord Snow. This is my daughter, Shireen.\u201d\n\u201cPrincess.\u201d Jon inclined his head. Shireen was a homely child, made even uglier by the greyscale that had left her neck and part of her cheek stiff and grey and cracked. \u201cMy brothers and I are at your service,\u201d he told the girl.\nShireen reddened. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you are acquainted with my kinsman, Ser Axell Florent?\u201d the queen went on.\n\u201cOnly by raven.\u201d And report. The letters he\u2019d received from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea had a deal to say of Axell Florent, very little of it good. \u201cSer Axell.\u201d\n\u201cLord Snow.\u201d A stout man, Florent had short legs and a thick chest. Coarse hair covered his cheeks and jowls and poked from his ears and nostrils.\n\u201cMy loyal knights,\u201d Queen Selyse went on. \u201cSer Narbert, Ser Benethon, Ser Brus, Ser Patrek, Ser Dorden, Ser Malegorn, Ser Lambert, Ser Perkin.\u201d Each worthy bowed in turn. She did not trouble to name her fool, but the cowbells on his antlered hat and the motley tattooed across his puffy cheeks made him hard to overlook. Patchface. Cotter Pyke\u2019s letters had made mention of him as well. Pyke claimed he was a simpleton.\nThen the queen beckoned to another curious member of her entourage: a tall gaunt stick of a man, his height accentuated by an outlandish three-tiered hat of purple felt. \u201cAnd here we have the honorable Tycho Nestoris, an emissary of the Iron Bank of Braavos, come to treat with His Grace King Stannis.\u201d\nThe banker doffed his hat and made a sweeping bow. \u201cLord Commander. I thank you and your brothers for your hospitality.\u201d He spoke the Common Tongue flawlessly, with only the slightest hint of accent. Half a foot taller than Jon, the Braavosi sported a beard as thin as a rope sprouting from his chin and reaching almost to his waist. His robes were a somber purple, trimmed with ermine. A high stiff collar framed his narrow face. \u201cI hope we shall not inconvenience you too greatly.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, my lord. You are most welcome.\u201d More welcome than this queen, if truth be told. Cotter Pyke had sent a raven ahead to advise them of the banker\u2019s coming. Jon Snow had thought of little since.\nJon turned back to the queen. \u201cThe royal chambers in the King\u2019s Tower have been prepared for Your Grace for so long as you wish to remain with us. This is our Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh. He will find quarters for your men.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of you to make room for us.\u201d The queen\u2019s words were courteous enough, though her tone said, It is no more than your duty, and you had best hope these quarters please me. \u201cWe will not be with you long. A few days at the most. It is our intent to press on to our new seat at the Nightfort as soon as we are rested. The journey from Eastwatch was wearisome.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Your Grace,\u201d said Jon. \u201cYou will be cold and hungry, I am sure. A hot meal awaits you in our common room.\u201d\n\u201cVery good.\u201d The queen glanced about the yard. \u201cFirst, though, we wish to consult with the Lady Melisandre.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Your Grace. Her apartments are in the King\u2019s Tower as well. This way, if you will?\u201d Queen Selyse nodded, took her daughter by the hand, and permitted him to lead them from the stables. Ser Axell, the Braavosi banker, and the rest of her party followed, like so many ducklings done up in wool and fur.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Jon Snow, \u201cmy builders have done all they can to make the Nightfort ready to receive you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet much of it remains in ruins. It is a large castle, the largest on the Wall, and we have only been able to restore a part of it. You might be more comfortable back at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\u201d\nQueen Selyse sniffed. \u201cWe are done with Eastwatch. We did not like it there. A queen should be mistress beneath her own roof. We found your Cotter Pyke to be an uncouth and unpleasant man, quarrelsome and niggardly.\u201d\nYou should hear what Cotter says of you. \u201cI am sorry for that, but I fear Your Grace will find conditions at the Nightfort even less to your liking. We speak of a fortress, not a palace. A grim place, and cold. Whereas Eastwatch\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEastwatch is not safe.\u201d The queen put a hand on her daughter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is the king\u2019s true heir. Shireen will one day sit the Iron Throne and rule the Seven Kingdoms. She must be kept from harm, and Eastwatch is where the attack will come. This Nightfort is the place my husband has chosen for our seat, and there we shall abide. We\u2014oh!\u201d\nAn enormous shadow emerged from behind the shell of the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower. Princess Shireen gave a shriek, and three of the queen\u2019s knights gasped in harmony. Another swore. \u201cSeven save us,\u201d he said, quite forgetting his new red god in his shock.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Jon told them. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in him, Your Grace. This is Wun Wun.\u201d\n\u201cWun Weg Wun Dar Wun.\u201d The giant\u2019s voice rumbled like a boulder crashing down a mountainside. He sank to his knees before them. Even kneeling, he loomed over them. \u201cKneel queen. Little queen.\u201d Words that Leathers had taught him, no doubt.\nPrincess Shireen\u2019s eyes went wide as dinner plates. \u201cHe\u2019s a giant! A real true giant, like from the stories. But why does he talk so funny?\u201d\n\u201cHe only knows a few words of the Common Tongue as yet,\u201d said Jon. \u201cIn their own land, giants speak the Old Tongue.\u201d\n\u201cCan I touch him?\u201d\n\u201cBest not,\u201d her mother warned. \u201cLook at him. A filthy creature.\u201d The queen turned her frown on Jon. \u201cLord Snow, what is this bestial creature doing on our side of the Wall?\u201d\n\u201cWun Wun is a guest of the Night\u2019s Watch, as you are.\u201d\nThe queen did not like that answer. Nor did her knights. Ser Axell grimaced in disgust, Ser Brus gave a nervous titter, Ser Narbert said, \u201cI had been told all the giants were dead.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost all.\u201d Ygritte wept for them.\n\u201cIn the dark the dead are dancing.\u201d Patchface shuffled his feet in a grotesque dance step. \u201cI know, I know, oh oh oh.\u201d At Eastwatch someone had sewn him a motley cloak of beaver pelts, sheepskins, and rabbit fur. His hat sported antlers hung with bells and long brown flaps of squirrel fur that hung down over his ears. Every step he took set him to ringing.\nWun Wun gaped at him with fascination, but when the giant reached for him the fool hopped back away, jingling. \u201cOh no, oh no, oh no.\u201d That brought Wun Wun lurching to his feet. The queen grabbed hold of Princess Shireen and pulled her back, her knights reached for their swords, and Patchface reeled away in alarm, lost his footing, and plopped down on his arse in a snowdrift.\nWun Wun began to laugh. A giant\u2019s laughter could put to shame a dragon\u2019s roar. Patchface covered his ears, Princess Shireen pressed her face into her mother\u2019s furs, and the boldest of the queen\u2019s knights moved forward, steel in hand. Jon raised an arm to block his path. \u201cYou do not want to anger him. Sheathe your steel, ser. Leathers, take Wun Wun back to Hardin\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cEat now, Wun Wun?\u201d asked the giant.\n\u201cEat now,\u201d Jon agreed. To Leathers he said, \u201cI\u2019ll send out a bushel of vegetables for him and meat for you. Start a fire.\u201d\nLeathers grinned. \u201cI will, m\u2019lord, but Hardin\u2019s is bone cold. Perhaps m\u2019lord could send out some wine to warm us?\u201d\n\u201cFor you. Not him.\u201d Wun Wun had never tasted wine until he came to Castle Black, but once he had, he had taken a gigantic liking to it. Too much a liking. Jon had enough to contend with just now without adding a drunken giant to the mix. He turned back to the queen\u2019s knights. \u201cMy lord father used to say a man should never draw his sword unless he means to use it.\u201d\n\u201cUsing it was my intent.\u201d The knight was clean-shaved and windburnt; beneath a cloak of white fur he wore a cloth-of-silver surcoat emblazoned with a blue five-pointed star. \u201cI had been given to understand that the Night\u2019s Watch defended the realm against such monsters. No one mentioned keeping them as pets.\u201d\nAnother bloody southron fool. \u201cYou are \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cSer Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain, if it please my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI do not know how you observe guest right on your mountain, ser. In the north we hold it sacred. Wun Wun is a guest here.\u201d\nSer Patrek smiled. \u201cTell me, Lord Commander, should the Others turn up, do you plan to offer hospitality to them as well?\u201d The knight turned to his queen. \u201cYour Grace, that is the King\u2019s Tower there, if I am not mistaken. If I may have the honor?\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d The queen took his arm and swept past the men of the Night\u2019s Watch with never a second glance.\nThose flames on her crown are the warmest thing about her. \u201cLord Tycho,\u201d Jon called. \u201cA moment, please.\u201d\nThe Braavosi halted. \u201cNo lord I. Only a simple servant of the Iron Bank of Braavos.\u201d\n\u201cCotter Pyke informs me that you came to Eastwatch with three ships. A galleas, a galley, and a cog.\u201d\n\u201cJust so, my lord. The crossing can be perilous in this season. One ship alone may founder, where three together may aid one another. The Iron Bank is always prudent in such matters.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps before you leave we might have a quiet word?\u201d\n\u201cI am at your service, Lord Commander. And in Braavos we say there is no time like the present. Will that suit?\u201d\n\u201cAs good as any. Shall we repair to my solar, or would you like to see the top of the Wall?\u201d\nThe banker glanced up, to where the ice loomed vast and pale against the sky. \u201cI fear it will be bitter cold up top.\u201d\n\u201cThat, and windy. You learn to walk well away from the edge. Men have been blown off. Still. The Wall is like nothing else on earth. You may never have another chance to see it.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt I shall rue my caution upon my deathbed, but after a long day in the saddle, a warm room sounds preferable to me.\u201d\n\u201cMy solar, then. Satin, some mulled wine, if you would.\u201d\nJon\u2019s rooms behind the armory were quiet enough, if not especially warm. His fire had gone out some time ago; Satin was not as diligent in feeding it as Dolorous Edd had been. Mormont\u2019s raven greeted them with a shriek of \u201cCorn!\u201d Jon hung up his cloak. \u201cYou come seeking Stannis, is that correct?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, my lord. Queen Selyse has suggested that we might send word to Deepwood Motte by raven, to inform His Grace that I await his pleasure at the Nightfort. The matter that I mean to put to him is too delicate to entrust to letters.\u201d\n\u201cA debt.\u201d What else could it be? \u201cHis own debt? Or his brother\u2019s?\u201d\nThe banker pressed his fingers together. \u201cIt would not be proper for me to discuss Lord Stannis\u2019s indebtedness or lack of same. As to King Robert\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it was indeed our pleasure to assist His Grace in his need. For so long as Robert lived, all was well. Now, however, the Iron Throne has ceased all repayment.\u201d\nCould the Lannisters truly be so foolish? \u201cYou cannot mean to hold Stannis responsible for his brother\u2019s debts.\u201d\n\u201cThe debts belong to the Iron Throne,\u201d Tycho declared, \u201cand whosoever sits on that chair must pay them. Since young King Tommen and his counsellors have become so obdurate, we mean to broach the subject with King Stannis. Should he prove himself more worthy of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he needs.\u201d\n\u201cHelp,\u201d the raven screamed. \u201cHelp, help, help.\u201d\nMuch of this Jon had surmised the moment he learned that the Iron Bank had sent an envoy to the Wall. \u201cWhen last we heard, His Grace was marching on Winterfell to confront Lord Bolton and his allies. You may seek him there if you wish, though that carries a risk. You could find yourself caught up in his war.\u201d\nTycho bowed his head. \u201cWe who serve the Iron Bank face death full as often as you who serve the Iron Throne.\u201d\nIs that whom I serve? Jon Snow was no longer certain. \u201cI can provide you with horses, provisions, guides, whatever is required to get you as far as Deepwood Motte. From there you will need to make your own way to Stannis.\u201d And you may well find his head upon a spike. \u201cThere will be a price.\u201d\n\u201cPrice,\u201d screamed Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cPrice, price.\u201d\n\u201cThere is always a price, is there not?\u201d The Braavosi smiled. \u201cWhat does the Watch require?\u201d\n\u201cYour ships, for a start. With their crews.\u201d\n\u201cAll three? How will I return to Braavos?\u201d\n\u201cI only need them for a single voyage.\u201d\n\u201cA hazardous voyage, I assume. For a start, you said?\u201d\n\u201cWe need a loan as well. Gold enough to keep us fed till spring. To buy food and hire ships to bring it to us.\u201d\n\u201cSpring?\u201d Tycho sighed. \u201cIt is not possible, my lord.\u201d\nWhat was it Stannis had said to him? You haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Lord Eddard father you on a fishwife? Perhaps he had at that.\nIt took the better part of an hour before the impossible became possible, and another hour before they could agree on terms. The flagon of mulled wine that Satin delivered helped them settle the more nettlesome points. By the time Jon Snow signed the parchment the Braavosi drew up, both of them were half-drunk and quite unhappy. Jon thought that a good sign.\nThe three Braavosi ships would bring the fleet at Eastwatch up to eleven, including the Ibbenese whaler that Cotter Pyke had commandeered on Jon\u2019s order, a trading galley out of Pentos similarly impressed, and three battered Lysene warships, remnants of Salladhor Saan\u2019s former fleet driven back north by the autumn storms. All three of Saan\u2019s ships had been in dire need of refitting, but by now the work should be complete.\nEleven ships was no wise enough, but if he waited any longer, the free folk at Hardhome would be dead by the time the rescue fleet arrived. Sail now or not at all. Whether Mother Mole and her people would be desperate enough to entrust their lives to the Night\u2019s Watch, though\u00a0\u2026\nThe day had darkened by the time he and Tycho Nestoris left the solar. Snow had begun to fall. \u201cOur respite was a brief one, it would seem.\u201d Jon drew his cloak about himself more tightly.\n\u201cWinter is nigh upon us. The day I left Braavos, there was ice on the canals.\u201d\n\u201cThree of my men passed through Braavos not long ago,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cAn old maester, a singer, and a young steward. They were escorting a wildling girl and her child to Oldtown. I do not suppose you chanced to encounter them?\u201d\n\u201cI fear not, my lord. Westerosi pass through Braavos every day, but most come and go from the Ragman\u2019s Harbor. The ships of the Iron Bank moor at the Purple Harbor. If you wish, I can make inquiries after them when I return home.\u201d\n\u201cNo need. By now they should be safe in Oldtown.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope so. The narrow sea is perilous this time of year, and of late there have been troubling reports of strange ships seen amongst the Stepstones.\u201d\n\u201cSalladhor Saan?\u201d\n\u201cThe Lysene pirate? Some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. And Lord Redwyne\u2019s war fleet creeps through the Broken Arm as well. On its way home, no doubt. But these men and their ships are well-known to us. No, these other sails\u00a0\u2026\u00a0from farther east, perhaps\u00a0\u2026\u00a0one hears queer talk of dragons.\u201d\n\u201cWould that we had one here. A dragon might warm things up a bit.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord jests. You will forgive me if I do not laugh. We Braavosi are descended from those who fled Valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. We do not jape of dragons.\u201d\nNo, I suppose not. \u201cMy apologies, Lord Tycho.\u201d\n\u201cNone is required, Lord Commander. Now I find that I am hungry. Lending such large sums of gold will give a man an appetite. Will you be so good as to point me to your feast hall?\u201d\n\u201cI will take you there myself.\u201d Jon gestured. \u201cThis way.\u201d\nOnce there, it would have been discourteous not to break bread with the banker, so Jon sent Satin off to fetch them food. The novelty of newcomers had brought out almost all the men who were not on duty or asleep, so the cellar was crowded and warm.\nThe queen herself was absent, as was her daughter. By now presumably they were settling into the King\u2019s Tower. But Ser Brus and Ser Malegorn were on hand, entertaining such brothers as had gathered with the latest tidings from Eastwatch and beyond the sea. Three of the queen\u2019s ladies sat together, attended by their serving maids and a dozen admiring men of the Night\u2019s Watch.\nNearer the door, the Queen\u2019s Hand was attacking a brace of capons, sucking the meat off the bones and washing down each bite with ale. When he espied Jon Snow, Axell Florent tossed a bone aside, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and sauntered over. With his bowed legs, barrel chest, and prominent ears, he presented a comical appearance, but Jon knew better than to laugh at him. He was an uncle to Queen Selyse and had been among the first to follow her in accepting Melisandre\u2019s red god. If he is not a kinslayer, he is the next best thing. Axell Florent\u2019s brother had been burned by Melisandre, Maester Aemon had informed him, yet Ser Axell had done little and less to stop it. What sort of man can stand by idly and watch his own brother being burned alive?\n\u201cNestoris,\u201d said Ser Axell, \u201cand the lord commander. Might I join you?\u201d He lowered himself to the bench before they could reply. \u201cLord Snow, if I may ask\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this wildling princess His Grace King Stannis wrote of\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where might she be, my lord?\u201d\nLong leagues from here, Jon thought. If the gods are good, by now she has found Tormund Giantsbane. \u201cVal is the younger sister of Dalla, who was Mance Rayder\u2019s wife and mother to his son. King Stannis took Val and the child captive after Dalla died in childbed, but she is no princess, not as you mean it.\u201d\nSer Axell shrugged. \u201cWhatever she may be, at Eastwatch men claimed the wench was fair. I\u2019d like to see with mine own eyes. Some of these wildling women, well, a man would need to turn them over to do his duty as a husband. If it please the lord commander, bring her out, let us have a look.\u201d\n\u201cShe is not a horse to be paraded for inspection, ser.\u201d\n\u201cI promise not to count her teeth.\u201d Florent grinned. \u201cOh, never fear, I\u2019ll treat her with all the courtesy she is due.\u201d\nHe knows I do not have her. A village has no secrets, and no more did Castle Black. Val\u2019s absence was not spoken of openly, but some men knew, and in the common hall at night the brothers talked. What has he heard? Jon wondered. How much does he believe? \u201cForgive me, ser, but Val will not be joining us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to her. Where do you keep the wench?\u201d\nAway from you. \u201cSomewhere safe. Enough, ser.\u201d\nThe knight\u2019s face grew flushed. \u201cMy lord, have you forgotten who I am?\u201d His breath smelled of ale and onions. \u201cMust I speak to the queen? A word from Her Grace and I can have this wildling girl delivered naked to the hall for our inspection.\u201d\nThat would be a pretty trick, even for a queen. \u201cThe queen would never presume upon our hospitality,\u201d Jon said, hoping that was true. \u201cNow I fear I must take my leave, before I forget the duties of a host. Lord Tycho, pray excuse me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d the banker said. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d\nOutside, the snow was coming down more heavily. Across the yard the King\u2019s Tower had turned into a hulking shadow, the lights in its windows obscured by falling snow.\nBack in his solar, Jon found the Old Bear\u2019s raven perched on the back of the oak-and-leather chair behind the trestle table. The bird began to scream for food the moment he entered. Jon took a fistful of dried kernels from the sack by the door and scattered them on the floor, then claimed the chair.\nTycho Nestoris had left behind a copy of their agreement. Jon read it over thrice. That was simple, he reflected. Simpler than I dared hope. Simpler than it should have been.\nIt gave him an uneasy feeling. Braavosi coin would allow the Night\u2019s Watch to buy food from the south when their own stores ran short, food enough to see them through the winter, however long it might prove to be. A long hard winter will leave the Watch so deep in debt that we will never climb out, Jon reminded himself, but when the choice is debt or death, best borrow.\nHe did not have to like it, though. And come spring, when the time came to repay all that gold, he would like it even less. Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.\nAs poor plump Tommen may be about to learn. No doubt the Lannisters had good reason for refusing to honor King Robert\u2019s debts, but it was folly all the same. If Stannis was not too stiff-necked to accept their terms, the Braavosi would give him all the gold and silver he required, coin enough to buy a dozen sellsword companies, to bribe a hundred lords, to keep his men paid, fed, clothed, and armed. Unless Stannis is lying dead beneath the walls of Winterfell, he may just have won the Iron Throne. He wondered if Melisandre had seen that in her fires.\nJon sat back, yawned, stretched. On the morrow he would draft orders for Cotter Pyke. Eleven ships to Hardhome. Bring back as many as you can, women and children first. It was time they set sail. Should I go myself, though, or leave it to Cotter? The Old Bear had led a ranging. Aye. And never returned.\nJon closed his eyes. Just for a moment\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and woke, stiff as a board, with the Old Bear\u2019s raven muttering, \u201cSnow, Snow,\u201d and Mully shaking him. \u201cM\u2019lord, you\u2019re wanted. Beg pardon, m\u2019lord. A girl\u2019s been found.\u201d\n\u201cA girl?\u201d Jon sat, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the back of his hands. \u201cVal? Has Val returned?\u201d\n\u201cNot Val, m\u2019lord. This side of the Wall, it were.\u201d\nArya. Jon straightened. It had to be her.\n\u201cGirl,\u201d screamed the raven. \u201cGirl, girl.\u201d\n\u201cTy and Dannel came on her two leagues south of Mole\u2019s Town. They were chasing down some wildlings who scampered off down the kingsroad. Brought them back as well, but then they come on the girl. She\u2019s highborn, m\u2019lord, and she\u2019s been asking for you.\u201d\n\u201cHow many with her?\u201d He moved to his basin, splashed water on his face. Gods, but he was tired.\n\u201cNone, m\u2019lord. She come alone. Her horse was dying under her. All skin and ribs it was, lame and lathered. They cut it loose and took the girl for questioning.\u201d\nA grey girl on a dying horse. Melisandre\u2019s fires had not lied, it would seem. But what had become of Mance Rayder and his spearwives? \u201cWhere is the girl now?\u201d\n\u201cMaester Aemon\u2019s chambers, m\u2019lord.\u201d The men of Castle Black still called it that, though by now the old maester should be warm and safe in Oldtown. \u201cGirl was blue from the cold, shivering like all get out, so Ty wanted Clydas to have a look at her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Jon felt fifteen years old again. Little sister. He rose and donned his cloak.\nThe snow was still falling as he crossed the yard with Mully. A golden dawn was breaking in the east, but behind Lady Melisandre\u2019s window in the King\u2019s Tower a reddish light still flickered. Does she never sleep? What game are you playing, priestess? Did you have some other task for Mance?\nHe wanted to believe it would be Arya. He wanted to see her face again, to smile at her and muss her hair, to tell her she was safe. She won\u2019t be safe, though. Winterfell is burned and broken and there are no more safe places.\nHe could not keep her here with him, no matter how much he might want to. The Wall was no place for a woman, much less a girl of noble birth. Nor was he about to turn her over to Stannis or Melisandre. The king would only want to marry her to one of his own men, Horpe or Massey or Godry Giantslayer, and the gods alone knew what use the red woman might want to make of her.\nThe best solution he could see would mean dispatching her to Eastwatch and asking Cotter Pyke to put her on a ship to someplace across the sea, beyond the reach of all these quarrelsome kings. It would need to wait until the ships returned from Hardhome, to be sure. She could return to Braavos with Tycho Nestoris. Perhaps the Iron Bank could help find some noble family to foster her. Braavos was the nearest of the Free Cities, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0which made it both the best and the worst choice. Lorath or the Port of Ibben might be safer. Wherever he might send her, though, Arya would need silver to support her, a roof above her head, someone to protect her. She was only a child.\nMaester Aemon\u2019s old chambers were so warm that the sudden cloud of steam when Mully pulled the door open was enough to blind the both of them. Within, a fresh fire was burning in the hearth, the logs crackling and spitting. Jon stepped over a puddle of damp clothing. \u201cSnow, Snow, Snow,\u201d the ravens called down from above. The girl was curled up near the fire, wrapped in a black woolen cloak three times her size and fast asleep.\nShe looked enough like Arya to give him pause, but only for a moment. A tall, skinny, coltish girl, all legs and elbows, her brown hair was woven in a thick braid and bound about with strips of leather. She had a long face, a pointy chin, small ears.\nBut she was too old, far too old. This girl is almost of an age with me. \u201cHas she eaten?\u201d Jon asked Mully.\n\u201cOnly bread and broth, my lord.\u201d Clydas rose from a chair. \u201cIt is best to go slow, Maester Aemon always said. Any more and she might not have been able to digest it.\u201d\nMully nodded. \u201cDannel had one o\u2019 Hobb\u2019s sausages and offered her a bite, but she wouldn\u2019t touch it.\u201d\nJon could not blame her for that. Hobb\u2019s sausages were made of grease and salt and things that did not bear thinking about. \u201cPerhaps we should just let her rest.\u201d\nThat was when the girl sat up, clutching the cloak to her small, pale breasts. She looked confused. \u201cWhere \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cCastle Black, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall.\u201d Her eyes filled up with tears. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nClydas moved closer. \u201cPoor child. How old are you?\u201d\n\u201cSixteen on my next nameday. And no child, but a woman grown and flowered.\u201d She yawned, covered her mouth with the cloak. One bare knee peeked through its folds. \u201cYou do not wear a chain. Are you a maester?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Clydas, \u201cbut I have served one.\u201d\nShe does look a bit like Arya, Jon thought. Starved and skinny, but her hair\u2019s the same color, and her eyes. \u201cI am told you have been asking after me. I am\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Jon Snow.\u201d The girl tossed her braid back. \u201cMy house and yours are bound in blood and honor. Hear me, kinsman. My uncle Cregan is hard upon my trail. You must not let him take me back to Karhold.\u201d\nJon was staring. I know this girl. There was something about her eyes, the way she held herself, the way she talked. For a moment the memory eluded him. Then it came. \u201cAlys Karstark.\u201d\nThat brought the ghost of a smile to her lips. \u201cI was not sure you would remember. I was six the last time you saw me.\u201d\n\u201cYou came to Winterfell with your father.\u201d The father Robb beheaded. \u201cI don\u2019t recall what for.\u201d\nShe blushed. \u201cSo I could meet your brother. Oh, there was some other pretext, but that was the real reason. I was almost of an age with Robb, and my father thought we might make a match. There was a feast. I danced with you and your brother both. He was very courteous and said that I danced beautifully. You were sullen. My father said that was to be expected in a bastard.\u201d\n\u201cI remember.\u201d It was only half a lie.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still a little sullen,\u201d the girl said, \u201cbut I will forgive you that if you will save me from my uncle.\u201d\n\u201cYour uncle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would that be Lord Arnolf?\u201d\n\u201cHe is no lord,\u201d Alys said scornfully. \u201cMy brother Harry is the rightful lord, and by law I am his heir. A daughter comes before an uncle. Uncle Arnolf is only castellan. He\u2019s my great-uncle, actually, my father\u2019s uncle. Cregan is his son. I suppose that makes him a cousin, but we always called him uncle. Now they mean to make me call him husband.\u201d She made a fist. \u201cBefore the war I was betrothed to Daryn Hornwood. We were only waiting till I flowered to be wed, but the Kingslayer killed Daryn in the Whispering Wood. My father wrote that he would find some southron lord to wed me, but he never did. Your brother Robb cut off his head for killing Lannisters.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cI thought the whole reason they marched south was to kill some Lannisters.\u201d\n\u201cIt was\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not so simple as that. Lord Karstark slew two prisoners, my lady. Unarmed boys, squires in a cell.\u201d\nThe girl did not seem surprised. \u201cMy father never bellowed like the Greatjon, but he was no less dangerous in his wroth. He is dead now too, though. So is your brother. But you and I are here, still living. Is there blood feud between us, Lord Snow?\u201d\n\u201cWhen a man takes the black he puts his feuds behind him. The Night\u2019s Watch has no quarrel with Karhold, nor with you.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I was afraid\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I begged my father to leave one of my brothers as castellan, but none of them wished to miss the glory and ransoms to be won in the south. Now Torr and Edd are dead. Harry was a prisoner at Maidenpool when last we heard, but that was almost a year ago. He may be dead as well. I did not know where else to turn but to the last son of Eddard Stark.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not the king? Karhold declared for Stannis.\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle declared for Stannis, in hopes it might provoke the Lannisters to take poor Harry\u2019s head. Should my brother die, Karhold should pass to me, but my uncles want my birthright for their own. Once Cregan gets a child by me they won\u2019t need me anymore. He\u2019s buried two wives already.\u201d She rubbed away a tear angrily, the way Arya might have done it. \u201cWill you help me?\u201d\n\u201cMarriages and inheritance are matters for the king, my lady. I will write to Stannis on your behalf, but\u2014\u201d\nAlys Karstark laughed, but it was the laughter of despair. \u201cWrite, but do not look for a reply. Stannis will be dead before he gets your message. My uncle will see to that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cArnolf is rushing to Winterfell, \u2019tis true, but only so he might put his dagger in your king\u2019s back. He cast his lot with Roose Bolton long ago\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for gold, the promise of a pardon, and poor Harry\u2019s head. Lord Stannis is marching to a slaughter. So he cannot help me, and would not even if he could.\u201d Alys knelt before him, clutching the black cloak. \u201cYou are my only hope, Lord Snow. In your father\u2019s name, I beg you. Protect me.\u201d",

      "content": "THE BLIND GIRL\nHer nights were lit by distant stars and the shimmer of moonlight on snow, but every dawn she woke to darkness.\nShe opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. So beautiful. She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd\u2019s eyes, the sound the dogs had made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her pack. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf. But only when she dreamed.\nThe blind girl rolled onto her side, sat up, sprang to her feet, stretched. Her bed was a rag-stuffed mattress on a shelf of cold stone, and she was always stiff and tight when she awakened. She padded to her basin on small, bare, callused feet, silent as a shadow, splashed cool water on her face, patted herself dry. Ser Gregor, she thought. Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. Her morning prayer. Or was it? No, she thought, not mine. I am no one. That is the night wolf\u2019s prayer. Someday she will find them, hunt them, smell their fear, taste their blood. Someday.\nShe found her smallclothes in a pile, sniffed at them to make sure they were fresh enough to wear, donned them in her darkness. Her servant\u2019s garb was where she\u2019d hung it\u2014a long tunic of undyed wool, roughspun and scratchy. She snapped it out and pulled it down over her head with one smooth practiced motion. Socks came last. One black, one white. The black one had stitching round the top, the white none; she could feel which was which, make sure she got each sock on the right leg. Skinny as they were, her legs were strong and springy and growing longer every day. She was glad of that. A water dancer needs good legs. Blind Beth was no water dancer, but she would not be Beth forever.\nShe knew the way to the kitchens, but her nose would have led her there even if she hadn\u2019t. Hot peppers and fried fish, she decided, sniffing down the hall, and bread fresh from Umma\u2019s oven. The smells made her belly rumble. The night wolf had feasted, but that would not fill the blind girl\u2019s belly. Dream meat could not nourish her, she had learned that early on.\nShe broke her fast on sardines, fried crisp in pepper oil and served so hot they burned her fingers. She mopped up the leftover oil with a chunk of bread torn off the end of Umma\u2019s morning loaf and washed it all down with a cup of watered wine, savoring the tastes and the smells, the rough feel of the crust beneath her fingers, the slickness of the oil, the sting of the hot pepper when it got into the half-healed scrape on the back of the hand. Hear, smell, taste, feel, she reminded herself. There are many ways to know the world for those who cannot see.\nSomeone had entered the room behind her, moving on soft padded slippers quiet as a mouse. Her nostrils flared. The kindly man. Men had a different smell than women, and there was a hint of orange in the air as well. The priest was fond of chewing orange rinds to sweeten his breath, whenever he could get them.\n\u201cAnd who are you this morning?\u201d she heard him ask, as he took his seat at the head of the table. Tap, tap, she heard, then a tiny crackling sound. Breaking his first egg.\n\u201cNo one,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cA lie. I know you. You are that blind beggar girl.\u201d\n\u201cBeth.\u201d She had known a Beth once, back at Winterfell when she was Arya Stark. Maybe that was why she\u2019d picked the name. Or maybe it was just because it went so well with blind.\n\u201cPoor child,\u201d said the kindly man. \u201cWould you like to have your eyes back? Ask, and you shall see.\u201d\nHe asked the same question every morning. \u201cI may want them on the morrow. Not today.\u201d Her face was still water, hiding all, revealing nothing.\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d She could hear him peeling the egg, then a faint silvery clink as he picked up the salt spoon. He liked his eggs well salted. \u201cWhere did my poor blind girl go begging last night?\u201d\n\u201cThe Inn of the Green Eel.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what three new things do you know that you did not know when last you left us?\u201d\n\u201cThe Sealord is still sick.\u201d\n\u201cThis is no new thing. The Sealord was sick yesterday, and he will still be sick upon the morrow.\u201d\n\u201cOr dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he is dead, that will be a new thing.\u201d\nWhen he is dead, there will be a choosing, and the knives will come out. That was the way of it in Braavos. In Westeros, a dead king was followed by his eldest son, but the Braavosi had no kings. \u201cTormo Fregar will be the new sealord.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what they are saying at the Inn of the Green Eel?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe kindly man took a bite of his egg. The girl heard him chewing. He never spoke with his mouth full. He swallowed, and said, \u201cSome men say there is wisdom in wine. Such men are fools. At other inns other names are being bruited about, never doubt.\u201d He took another bite of egg, chewed, swallowed. \u201cWhat three new things do you know, that you did not know before?\u201d\n\u201cI know that some men are saying that Tormo Fregar will surely be the new sealord,\u201d she answered. \u201cSome drunken men.\u201d\n\u201cBetter. And what else do you know?\u201d\nIt is snowing in the riverlands, in Westeros, she almost said. But he would have asked her how she knew that, and she did not think that he would like her answer. She chewed her lip, thinking back to last night. \u201cThe whore S\u2019vrone is with child. She is not certain of the father, but thinks it might have been that Tyroshi sellsword that she killed.\u201d\n\u201cThis is good to know. What else?\u201d\n\u201cThe Merling Queen has chosen a new Mermaid to take the place of the one that drowned. She is the daughter of a Prestayn serving maid, thirteen and penniless, but lovely.\u201d\n\u201cSo are they all, at the beginning,\u201d said the priest, \u201cbut you cannot know that she is lovely unless you have seen her with your own eyes, and you have none. Who are you, child?\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d\n\u201cBlind Beth the beggar girl is who I see. She is a wretched liar, that one. See to your duties. Valar morghulis.\u201d\n\u201cValar dohaeris.\u201d She gathered up her bowl and cup, knife and spoon, and pushed to her feet. Last of all she grasped her stick. It was five feet long, slender and supple, thick as her thumb, with leather wrapped around the shaft a foot from the top. Better than eyes, once you learn how to use it, the waif had told her.\nThat was a lie. They often lied to her, to test her. No stick was better than a pair of eyes. It was good to have, though, so she always kept it close. Umma had taken to calling her Stick, but names did not matter. She was her. No one. I am no one. Just a blind girl, just a servant of Him of Many Faces.\nEach night at supper the waif brought her a cup of milk and told her to drink it down. The drink had a queer, bitter taste that the blind girl soon learned to loathe. Even the faint smell that warned her what it was before it touched her tongue soon made her feel like retching, but she drained the cup all the same.\n\u201cHow long must I be blind?\u201d she would ask.\n\u201cUntil darkness is as sweet to you as light,\u201d the waif would say, \u201cor until you ask us for your eyes. Ask and you shall see.\u201d\nAnd then you will send me away. Better blind than that. They would not make her yield.\nOn the day she had woken blind, the waif took her by the hand and led her through the vaults and tunnels of the rock on which the House of Black and White was built, up the steep stone steps into the temple proper. \u201cCount the steps as you climb,\u201d she had said. \u201cLet your fingers brush the wall. There are markings there, invisible to the eye, plain to the touch.\u201d\nThat was her first lesson. There had been many more.\nPoisons and potions were for the afternoons. She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif\u2019s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.\nSupper was for language lessons. The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content. He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.\nIn the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different. Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no one had no tears. Without eyes, even the simplest task was perilous. She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut her finger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps. All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears; the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed round the legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.\n\u201cYou have five senses,\u201d the kindly man said. \u201cLearn to use the other four, you will have fewer cuts and scrapes and scabs.\u201d\nShe could feel air currents on her skin now. She could find the kitchens by their smell, tell men from women by their scents. She knew Umma and the servants and the acolytes by the pattern of their footfalls, could tell one from the other before they got close enough to smell (but not the waif or the kindly man, who hardly made a sound at all unless they wanted to). The candles burning in the temple had scents as well; even the unscented ones gave off faint wisps of smoke from their wicks. They had as well been shouting, once she had learned to use her nose.\nThe dead men had their own smell too. One of her duties was to find them in the temple every morning, wherever they had chosen to lie down and close their eyes after drinking from the pool.\nThis morning she found two.\nOne man had died at the feet of the Stranger, a single candle flickering above him. She could feel its heat, and the scent that it gave off tickled her nose. The candle burned with a dark red flame, she knew; for those with eyes, the corpse would have seemed awash in a ruddy glow. Before summoning the serving men to carry him away, she knelt and felt his face, tracing the line of his jaw, brushing her fingers across his cheeks and nose, touching his hair. Curly hair, and thick. A handsome face, unlined. He was young. She wondered what had brought him here to seek the gift of death. Dying bravos oft found their way to the House of Black and White, to hasten their ends, but this man had no wounds that she could find.\nThe second body was that of an old woman. She had gone to sleep upon a dreaming couch, in one of the hidden alcoves where special candles conjured visions of things loved and lost. A sweet death and a gentle one, the kindly man was fond of saying. Her fingers told her that the old woman had died with a smile on her face. She had not been dead long. Her body was still warm to the touch. Her skin is so soft, like old thin leather that\u2019s been folded and wrinkled a thousand times.\nWhen the serving men arrived to bear the corpse away, the blind girl followed them. She let their footsteps be her guide, but when they made their descent she counted. She knew the counts of all the steps by heart. Under the temple was a maze of vaults and tunnels where even men with two good eyes were often lost, but the blind girl had learned every inch of it, and she had her stick to help her find her way should her memory falter.\nThe corpses were laid out in the vault. The blind girl went to work in the dark, stripping the dead of boots and clothes and other possessions, emptying their purses and counting out their coins. Telling one coin from another by touch alone was one of the first things the waif had taught her, after they took away her eyes. The Braavosi coins were old friends; she need only brush her fingertips across their faces to recognize them. Coins from other lands and cities were harder, especially those from far away. Volantene honors were most common, little coins no bigger than a penny with a crown on one side and a skull on the other. Lysene coins were oval and showed a naked woman. Other coins had ships stamped onto them, or elephants, or goats. The Westerosi coins showed a king\u2019s head on the front and a dragon on the back.\nThe old woman had no purse, no wealth at all but for a ring on one thin finger. On the handsome man she found four golden dragons out of Westeros. She was running the ball of her thumb across the most worn of them, trying to decide which king it showed, when she heard the door opening softly behind her.\n\u201cWho is there?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo one.\u201d The voice was deep, harsh, cold.\nAnd moving. She stepped to one side, grabbed for her stick, snapped it up to protect her face. Wood clacked against wood. The force of the blow almost knocked the stick from her hand. She held on, slashed back\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and found only empty air where he should have been. \u201cNot there,\u201d the voice said. \u201cAre you blind?\u201d\nShe did not answer. Talking would only muddle any sounds he might be making. He would be moving, she knew. Left or right? She jumped left, swung right, hit nothing. A stinging cut from behind her caught her in the back of the legs. \u201cAre you deaf?\u201d She spun, the stick in her left hand, whirling, missing. From the left she heard the sound of laughter. She slashed right.\nThis time she connected. Her stick smacked off his own. The impact sent a jolt up her arm. \u201cGood,\u201d the voice said.\nThe blind girl did not know whom the voice belonged to. One of the acolytes, she supposed. She did not remember ever hearing his voice before, but what was there to say that the servants of the Many-Faced God could not change their voices as easily as they did their faces? Besides her, the House of Black and White was home to two serving men, three acolytes, Umma the cook, and the two priests that she called the waif and the kindly man. Others came and went, sometimes by secret ways, but those were the only ones who lived here. Her nemesis could be any of them.\nThe girl darted sideways, her stick spinning, heard a sound behind her, whirled in that direction, struck at air. And all at once his own stick was between her legs, tangling them as she tried to turn again, scraping down her shin. She stumbled and went down to one knee, so hard she bit her tongue.\nThere she stopped. Still as stone. Where is he?\nBehind her, he laughed. He rapped her smartly on one ear, then cracked her knuckles as she was scrambling to her feet. Her stick fell clattering to the stone. She hissed in fury.\n\u201cGo on. Pick it up. I am done beating you for today.\u201d\n\u201cNo one beat me.\u201d The girl crawled on all fours until she found her stick, then sprang back to her feet, bruised and dirty. The vault was still and silent. He was gone. Or was he? He could be standing right beside her, she would never know. Listen for his breathing, she told herself, but there was nothing. She gave it another moment, then put her stick aside and resumed her work. If I had my eyes, I could beat him bloody. One day the kindly man would give them back, and she would show them all.\nThe old woman\u2019s corpse was cool by now, the bravo\u2019s body stiffening. The girl was used to that. Most days, she spent more time with the dead than with the living. She missed the friends she\u2019d had when she was Cat of the Canals; Old Brusco with his bad back, his daughters Talea and Brea, the mummers from the Ship, Merry and her whores at the Happy Port, all the other rogues and wharfside scum. She missed Cat herself the most of all, even more than she missed her eyes. She had liked being Cat, more than she had ever liked being Salty or Squab or Weasel or Arry. I killed Cat when I killed that singer. The kindly man had told her that they would have taken her eyes from her anyway, to help her to learn to use her other senses, but not for half a year. Blind acolytes were common in the House of Black and White, but few as young as she. The girl was not sorry, though. Dareon had been a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch; he had deserved to die.\nShe had said as much to the kindly man. \u201cAnd are you a god, to decide who should live and who should die?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWe give the gift to those marked by Him of Many Faces, after prayers and sacrifice. So has it always been, from the beginning. I have told you of the founding of our order, of how the first of us answered the prayers of slaves who wished for death. The gift was given only to those who yearned for it, in the beginning\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but one day, the first of us heard a slave praying not for his own death but for his master\u2019s. So fervently did he desire this that he offered all he had, that his prayer might be answered. And it seemed to our first brother that this sacrifice would be pleasing to Him of Many Faces, so that night he granted the prayer. Then he went to the slave and said, \u2018You offered all you had for this man\u2019s death, but slaves have nothing but their lives. That is what the god desires of you. For the rest of your days on earth, you will serve him.\u2019 And from that moment, we were two.\u201d His hand closed around her arm, gently but firmly. \u201cAll men must die. We are but death\u2019s instruments, not death himself. When you slew the singer, you took god\u2019s powers on yourself. We kill men, but we do not presume to judge them. Do you understand?\u201d\nNo, she thought. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou lie. And that is why you must now walk in darkness until you see the way. Unless you wish to leave us. You need only ask, and you may have your eyes back.\u201d\nNo, she thought. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\nThat evening, after supper and a short session of the lying game, the blind girl tied a strip of rag around her head to hide her useless eyes, found her begging bowl, and asked the waif to help her don Beth\u2019s face. The waif had shaved her head for her when they took her eyes; a mummer\u2019s cut, she called it, since many mummers did the same so their wigs might fit them better. But it worked for beggars too and helped to keep their heads free from fleas and lice. More than a wig was needed, though. \u201cI could cover you with weeping sores,\u201d the waif said, \u201cbut then innkeeps and taverners would chase you from their doors.\u201d Instead she gave her pox scars and a mummer\u2019s mole on one cheek with a dark hair growing from it. \u201cIs it ugly?\u201d the blind girl asked.\n\u201cIt is not pretty.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d She had never cared if she was pretty, even when she was stupid Arya Stark. Only her father had ever called her that. Him, and Jon Snow, sometimes. Her mother used to say she could be pretty if she would just wash and brush her hair and take more care with her dress, the way her sister did. To her sister and sister\u2019s friends and all the rest, she had just been Arya Horseface. But they were all dead now, even Arya, everyone but her half-brother, Jon. Some nights she heard talk of him, in the taverns and brothels of the Ragman\u2019s Harbor. The Black Bastard of the Wall, one man had called him. Even Jon would never know Blind Beth, I bet. That made her sad.\nThe clothes she wore were rags, faded and fraying, but warm clean rags for all that. Under them she hid three knives\u2014one in a boot, one up a sleeve, one sheathed at the small of her back. Braavosi were a kindly folk, by and large, more like to help the poor blind beggar girl than try to do her harm, but there were always a few bad ones who might see her as someone they could safely rob or rape. The blades were for them, though so far the blind girl had not been forced to use them. A cracked wooden begging bowl and belt of hempen rope completed her garb.\nShe set out as the Titan roared the sunset, counting her way down the steps from the temple door, then tapping to the bridge that took her over the canal to the Isle of the Gods. She could tell that the fog was thick from the clammy way her clothes clung to her and the damp feeling of the air on her bare hands. The mists of Braavos did queer things to sounds as well, she had found. Half the city will be half-blind tonight.\nAs she made her way past the temples, she could hear the acolytes of the Cult of Starry Wisdom atop their scrying tower, singing to the evening stars. A wisp of scented smoke hung in the air, drawing her down the winding path to where the red priests had fired the great iron braziers outside the house of the Lord of Light. Soon she could even feel the heat in the air, as red R\u2019hllor\u2019s worshipers lifted their voices in prayer. \u201cFor the night is dark and full of terrors,\u201d they prayed.\nNot for me. Her nights were bathed in moonlight and filled with the songs of her pack, with the taste of red meat torn off the bone, with the warm familiar smells of her grey cousins. Only during the days was she alone and blind.\nShe was no stranger to the waterfront. Cat used to prowl the wharves and alleys of the Ragman\u2019s Harbor selling mussels and oysters and clams for Brusco. With her rag and her shaved head and her mummer\u2019s mole, she did not look the same as she had then, but just to be safe she stayed away from the Ship and the Happy Port and the other places where Cat had been best known.\nShe knew each inn and tavern by its scent. The Black Bargeman had a briny smell. Pynto\u2019s stank of sour wine, stinky cheese, and Pynto himself, who never changed his clothes or washed his hair. At the Sailmender\u2019s the smoky air was always spiced with the scent of roasting meat. The House of Seven Lamps was fragrant with incense, the Satin Palace with the perfumes of pretty young girls who dreamed of being courtesans.\nEach place had its own sounds too. Moroggo\u2019s and the Inn of the Green Eel had singers performing most nights. At the Outcast Inn the patrons themselves did the singing, in drunken voices and half a hundred tongues. The Foghouse was always crowded with polemen off the serpent boats, arguing about gods and courtesans and whether or not the Sealord was a fool. The Satin Palace was much quieter, a place of whispered endearments, the soft rustle of silk gowns, and the giggling of girls.\nBeth did her begging at a different place every night. She had learned early on that innkeeps and taverners were more apt to tolerate her presence if it was not a frequent occurrence. Last night she had spent outside the Inn of the Green Eel, so tonight she turned right instead of left after the Bloody Bridge and made her way to Pynto\u2019s at the other end of Ragman\u2019s Harbor, right on the edge of the Drowned Town. Loud and smelly he might be, but Pynto had a soft heart under all his unwashed clothes and bluster. Oft as not, he would let her come inside where it was warm if the place was not too crowded, and now and again he might even let her have a mug of ale and a crust of food whilst regaling her with his stories. In his younger days Pynto had been the most notorious pirate in the Stepstones, to hear him tell it; he loved nothing better than to speak at great length about his exploits.\nShe was in luck tonight. The tavern was near empty, and she was able to claim a quiet corner not far from the fire. No sooner had she settled there and crossed her legs than something brushed up against her thigh. \u201cYou again?\u201d said the blind girl. She scratched his head behind one ear, and the cat jumped up into her lap and began to purr. Braavos was full of cats, and no place more than Pynto\u2019s. The old pirate believed they brought good luck and kept his tavern free of vermin. \u201cYou know me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she whispered. Cats were not fooled by a mummer\u2019s moles. They remembered Cat of the Canals.\nIt was a good night for the blind girl. Pynto was in a jolly mood and gave her a cup of watered wine, a chunk of stinky cheese, and half of an eel pie. \u201cPynto is a very good man,\u201d he announced, then settled down to tell her of the time he seized the spice ship, a tale she had heard a dozen times before.\nAs the hours passed the tavern filled. Pynto was soon too busy to pay her any mind, but several of his regulars dropped coins into her begging bowl. Other tables were occupied by strangers: Ibbenese whalers who reeked of blood and blubber, a pair of bravos with scented oil in their hair, a fat man out of Lorath who complained that Pynto\u2019s booths were too small for his belly. And later three Lyseni, sailors off the Goodheart, a storm-wracked galley that had limped into Braavos last night and been seized this morning by the Sealord\u2019s guards.\nThe Lyseni took the table nearest to the fire and spoke quietly over cups of black tar rum, keeping their voices low so no one could overhear. But she was no one and she heard most every word. And for a time it seemed that she could see them too, through the slitted yellow eyes of the tomcat purring in her lap. One was old and one was young and one had lost an ear, but all three had the white-blond hair and smooth fair skin of Lys, where the blood of the old Freehold still ran strong.\nThe next morning, when the kindly man asked her what three things she knew that she had not known before, she was ready.\n\u201cI know why the Sealord seized the Goodheart. She was carrying slaves. Hundreds of slaves, women and children, roped together in her hold.\u201d Braavos had been founded by escaped slaves, and the slave trade was forbidden here.\n\u201cI know where the slaves came from. They were wildlings from Westeros, from a place called Hardhome. An old ruined place, accursed.\u201d Old Nan had told her tales of Hardhome, back at Winterfell when she had still been Arya Stark. \u201cAfter the big battle where the King-Beyond-the-Wall was killed, the wildlings ran away, and this woods witch said that if they went to Hardhome, ships would come and carry them away to someplace warm. But no ships came, except these two Lyseni pirates, Goodheart and Elephant, that had been driven north by a storm. They dropped anchor off Hardhome to make repairs, and saw the wildlings, but there were thousands and they didn\u2019t have room for all of them, so they said they\u2019d just take the women and the children. The wildlings had nothing to eat, so the men sent out their wives and daughters, but as soon as the ships were out to sea, the Lyseni drove them below and roped them up. They meant to sell them all in Lys. Only then they ran into another storm and the ships were parted. The Goodheart was so damaged her captain had no choice but to put in here, but the Elephant may have made it back to Lys. The Lyseni at Pynto\u2019s think that she\u2019ll return with more ships. The price of slaves is rising, they said, and there are thousands more women and children at Hardhome.\u201d\n\u201cIt is good to know. This is two. Is there a third?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I know that you\u2019re the one who has been hitting me.\u201d Her stick flashed out, and cracked against his fingers, sending his own stick clattering to the floor.\nThe priest winced and snatched his hand back. \u201cAnd how could a blind girl know that?\u201d\nI saw you. \u201cI gave you three. I don\u2019t need to give you four.\u201d Maybe on the morrow she would tell him about the cat that had followed her home last night from Pynto\u2019s, the cat that was hiding in the rafters, looking down on them. Or maybe not. If he could have secrets, so could she.\nThat evening Umma served salt-crusted crabs for supper. When her cup was presented to her, the blind girl wrinkled her nose and drank it down in three long gulps. Then she gasped and dropped the cup. Her tongue was on fire, and when she gulped a cup of wine the flames spread down her throat and up her nose.\n\u201cWine will not help, and water will just fan the flames,\u201d the waif told her. \u201cEat this.\u201d A heel of bread was pressed into her hand. The girl stuffed it in her mouth, chewed, swallowed. It helped. A second chunk helped more.\nAnd come the morning, when the night wolf left her and she opened her eyes, she saw a tallow candle burning where no candle had been the night before, its uncertain flame swaying back and forth like a whore at the Happy Port. She had never seen anything so beautiful.",

      "content": "A GHOST IN WINTERFELL\nThe dead man was found at the base of the inner wall, with his neck broken and only his left leg showing above the snow that had buried him during the night.\nIf Ramsay\u2019s bitches had not dug him up, he might have stayed buried till spring. By the time Ben Bones pulled them off, Grey Jeyne had eaten so much of the dead man\u2019s face that half the day was gone before they knew for certain who he\u2019d been: a man-at-arms of four-and-forty years who had marched north with Roger Ryswell. \u201cA drunk,\u201d Ryswell declared. \u201cPissing off the wall, I\u2019ll wager. He slipped and fell.\u201d No one disagreed. But Theon Greyjoy found himself wondering why any man would climb the snow-slick steps to the battlements in the black of night just to take a piss.\nAs the garrison broke its fast that morning on stale bread fried in bacon grease (the lords and knights ate the bacon), the talk along the benches was of little but the corpse.\n\u201cStannis has friends inside the castle,\u201d Theon heard one serjeant mutter. He was an old Tallhart man, three trees sewn on his ragged surcoat. The watch had just changed. Men were coming in from the cold, stomping their feet to knock the snow off their boots and breeches as the midday meal was served\u2014blood sausage, leeks, and brown bread still warm from the ovens.\n\u201cStannis?\u201d laughed one of Roose Ryswell\u2019s riders. \u201cStannis is snowed to death by now. Else he\u2019s run back to the Wall with his tail froze between his legs.\u201d\n\u201cHe could be camped five feet from our walls with a hundred thousand men,\u201d said an archer wearing Cerwyn colors. \u201cWe\u2019d never see a one o\u2019 them through this storm.\u201d\nEndless, ceaseless, merciless, the snow had fallen day and night. Drifts climbed the walls and filled the crenels along the battlements, white blankets covered every roof, tents sagged beneath the weight. Ropes were strung from hall to hall to help men keep from getting lost as they crossed the yards. Sentries crowded into the guard turrets to warm half-frozen hands over glowing braziers, leaving the wallwalks to the snowy sentinels the squires had thrown up, who grew larger and stranger every night as wind and weather worked their will upon them. Ragged beards of ice grew down the spears clasped in their snowy fists. No less a man than Hosteen Frey, who had been heard growling that he did not fear a little snow, lost an ear to frostbite.\nThe horses in the yards suffered most. The blankets thrown over them to keep them warm soaked through and froze if not changed regularly. When fires were lit to keep the cold at bay, they did more harm then good. The warhorses feared the flames and fought to get away, injuring themselves and other horses as they twisted at their lines. Only the horses in the stables were safe and warm, but the stables were already overcrowded.\n\u201cThe gods have turned against us,\u201d old Lord Locke was heard to say in the Great Hall. \u201cThis is their wroth. A wind as cold as hell itself and snows that never end. We are cursed.\u201d\n\u201cStannis is cursed,\u201d a Dreadfort man insisted. \u201cHe is the one out there in the storm.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis might be warmer than we know,\u201d one foolish freerider argued. \u201cHis sorceress can summon fire. Might be her red god can melt these snows.\u201d\nThat was unwise, Theon knew at once. The man spoke too loudly, and in the hearing of Yellow Dick and Sour Alyn and Ben Bones. When the tale reached Lord Ramsay, he sent his Bastard\u2019s Boys to seize the man and drag him out into the snow. \u201cAs you seem so fond of Stannis, we will send you to him,\u201d he said. Damon Dance-for-Me gave the freerider a few lashes with his long greased whip. Then, whilst Skinner and Yellow Dick made wagers on how fast his blood would freeze, Ramsay had the man dragged up to the Battlements Gate.\nWinterfell\u2019s great main gates were closed and barred, and so choked with ice and snow that the portcullis would need to be chipped free before it could be raised. Much the same was true of the Hunter\u2019s Gate, though there at least ice was not a problem, since the gate had seen recent use. The Kingsroad Gate had not, and ice had frozen those drawbridge chains rock hard. Which left the Battlements Gate, a small arched postern in the inner wall. Only half a gate, in truth, it had a drawbridge that spanned the frozen moat but no corresponding gateway through the outer wall, offering access to the outer ramparts but not the world beyond.\nThe bleeding freerider was carried across the bridge and up the steps, still protesting. Then Skinner and Sour Alyn seized his arms and legs and tossed him from the wall to the ground eighty feet below. The drifts had climbed so high that they swallowed the man bodily\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but bowmen on the battlements claimed they glimpsed him sometime later, dragging a broken leg through the snow. One feathered his rump with an arrow as he wriggled away. \u201cHe will be dead within the hour,\u201d Lord Ramsay promised.\n\u201cOr he\u2019ll be sucking Lord Stannis\u2019s cock before the sun goes down,\u201d Whoresbane Umber threw back.\n\u201cHe best take care it don\u2019t break off,\u201d laughed Rickard Ryswell. \u201cAny man out there in this, his cock is frozen hard.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis is lost in the storm,\u201d said Lady Dustin. \u201cHe\u2019s leagues away, dead or dying. Let winter do its worst. A few more days and the snows will bury him and his army both.\u201d\nAnd us as well, thought Theon, marveling at her folly. Lady Barbrey was of the north and should have known better. The old gods might be listening.\nSupper was pease porridge and yesterday\u2019s bread, and that caused muttering amongst the common men as well; above the salt, the lords and knights were seen to be eating ham.\nTheon was bent over a wooden bowl finishing the last of his own portion of pease porridge when a light touch on his shoulder made him drop his spoon. \u201cNever touch me,\u201d he said, twisting down to snatch the fallen utensil off the floor before one of Ramsay\u2019s girls could get hold of it. \u201cNever touch me.\u201d\nShe sat down next to him, too close, another of Abel\u2019s washerwomen. This one was young, fifteen or maybe sixteen, with shaggy blond hair in need of a good wash and a pair of pouty lips in need of a good kiss. \u201cSome girls like to touch,\u201d she said, with a little half-smile. \u201cIf it please m\u2019lord, I\u2019m Holly.\u201d\nHolly the whore, he thought, but she was pretty enough. Once he might have laughed and pulled her into his lap, but that day was done. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cTo see these crypts. Where are they, m\u2019lord? Would you show me?\u201d Holly toyed with a strand of her hair, coiling it around her little finger. \u201cDeep and dark, they say. A good place for touching. All the dead kings watching.\u201d\n\u201cDid Abel send you to me?\u201d\n\u201cMight be. Might be I sent myself. But if it\u2019s Abel you\u2019re wanting, I could bring him. He\u2019ll sing m\u2019lord a sweet song.\u201d\nEvery word she said persuaded Theon that this was all some ploy. But whose, and to what end? What could Abel want of him? The man was just a singer, a pander with a lute and a false smile. He wants to know how I took the castle, but not to make a song of it. The answer came to him. He wants to know how we got in so he can get out. Lord Bolton had Winterfell sewn up tight as a babe\u2019s swaddling clothes. No one could come or go without his leave. He wants to flee, him and his washerwoman. Theon could not blame him, but even so he said, \u201cI want no part of Abel, or you, or any of your sisters. Just leave me be.\u201d\nOutside the snow was swirling, dancing. Theon groped his way to the wall, then followed it to the Battlements Gate. He might have taken the guards for a pair of Little Walder\u2019s snowmen if he had not seen the white plumes of their breath. \u201cI want to walk the walls,\u201d he told them, his own breath frosting in the air.\n\u201cBloody cold up there,\u201d one warned.\n\u201cBloody cold down here,\u201d the other said, \u201cbut you do as you like, turncloak.\u201d He waved Theon through the gate.\nThe steps were snow-packed and slippery, treacherous in the dark. Once he reached the wallwalk, it did not take him long to find the place where they\u2019d thrown down the freerider. He knocked aside the wall of fresh-fallen snow filling up the crenel and leaned out between the merlons. I could jump, he thought. He lived, why shouldn\u2019t I? He could jump, and \u00a0\u2026\u00a0And what? Break a leg and die beneath the snow? Creep away to freeze to death?\nIt was madness. Ramsay would hunt him down, with the girls. Red Jeyne and Jez and Helicent would tear him to pieces if the gods were good. Or worse, he might be taken back alive. \u201cI have to remember my name,\u201d he whispered.\nThe next morning Ser Aenys Frey\u2019s grizzled squire was found naked and dead of exposure in the old castle lichyard, his face so obscured by hoarfrost that he appeared to be wearing a mask. Ser Aenys put it forth that the man had drunk too much and gotten lost in the storm, though no one could explain why he had taken off his clothes to go outside. Another drunkard, Theon thought. Wine could drown a host of suspicions.\nThen, before the day was done, a crossbowman sworn to the Flints turned up in the stables with a broken skull. Kicked by a horse, Lord Ramsay declared. A club, more like, Theon decided.\nIt all seemed so familiar, like a mummer show that he had seen before. Only the mummers had changed. Roose Bolton was playing the part that Theon had played the last time round, and the dead men were playing the parts of Aggar, Gynir Rednose, and Gelmarr the Grim. Reek was there too, he remembered, but he was a different Reek, a Reek with bloody hands and lies dripping from his lips, sweet as honey. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with sneak.\nThe deaths set Roose Bolton\u2019s lords to quarreling openly in the Great Hall. Some were running short of patience. \u201cHow long must we sit here waiting for this king who never comes?\u201d Ser Hosteen Frey demanded. \u201cWe should take the fight to Stannis and make an end to him.\u201d\n\u201cLeave the castle?\u201d croaked one-armed Harwood Stout. His tone suggested he would sooner have his remaining arm hacked off. \u201cWould you have us charge blindly into the snow?\u201d\n\u201cTo fight Lord Stannis we would first need to find him,\u201d Roose Ryswell pointed out. \u201cOur scouts go out the Hunter\u2019s Gate, but of late, none of them return.\u201d\nLord Wyman Manderly slapped his massive belly. \u201cWhite Harbor does not fear to ride with you, Ser Hosteen. Lead us out, and my knights will ride behind you.\u201d\nSer Hosteen turned on the fat man. \u201cClose enough to drive a lance through my back, aye. Where are my kin, Manderly? Tell me that. Your guests, who brought your son back to you.\u201d\n\u201cHis bones, you mean.\u201d Manderly speared a chunk of ham with his dagger. \u201cI recall them well. Rhaegar of the round shoulders, with his glib tongue. Bold Ser Jared, so swift to draw his steel. Symond the spymaster, always clinking coins. They brought home Wendel\u2019s bones. It was Tywin Lannister who returned Wylis to me, safe and whole, as he had promised. A man of his word, Lord Tywin, Seven save his soul.\u201d Lord Wyman popped the meat into his mouth, chewed it noisily, smacked his lips, and said, \u201cThe road has many dangers, ser. I gave your brothers guest gifts when we took our leave of White Harbor. We swore we would meet again at the wedding. Many and more bore witness to our parting.\u201d\n\u201cMany and more?\u201d mocked Aenys Frey. \u201cOr you and yours?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting, Frey?\u201d The Lord of White Harbor wiped his mouth with his sleeve. \u201cI do not like your tone, ser. No, not one bloody bit.\u201d\n\u201cStep out into the yard, you sack of suet, and I\u2019ll serve you all the bloody bits that you can stomach,\u201d Ser Hosteen said.\nWyman Manderly laughed, but half a dozen of his knights were on their feet at once. It fell to Roger Ryswell and Barbrey Dustin to calm them with quiet words. Roose Bolton said nothing at all. But Theon Greyjoy saw a look in his pale eyes that he had never seen before\u2014an uneasiness, even a hint of fear.\nThat night the new stable collapsed beneath the weight of the snow that had buried it. Twenty-six horses and two grooms died, crushed beneath the falling roof or smothered under the snows. It took the best part of the morning to dig out the bodies. Lord Bolton appeared briefly in the outer ward to inspect the scene, then ordered the remaining horses brought inside, along with the mounts still tethered in the outer ward. And no sooner had the men finished digging out the dead men and butchering the horses than another corpse was found.\nThis one could not be waved away as some drunken tumble or the kick of a horse. The dead man was one of Ramsay\u2019s favorites, the squat, scrofulous, ill-favored man-at-arms called Yellow Dick. Whether his dick had actually been yellow was hard to determine, as someone had sliced it off and stuffed it into his mouth so forcefully they had broken three of his teeth. When the cooks found him outside the kitchens, buried up to his neck in a snowdrift, both dick and man were blue from cold. \u201cBurn the body,\u201d Roose Bolton ordered, \u201cand see that you do not speak of this. I\u2019ll not have this tale spread.\u201d\nThe tale spread nonetheless. By midday most of Winterfell had heard, many from the lips of Ramsay Bolton, whose \u201cboy\u201d Yellow Dick had been. \u201cWhen we find the man who did this,\u201d Lord Ramsay promised, \u201cI will flay the skin off him, cook it crisp as crackling, and make him eat it, every bite.\u201d Word went out that the killer\u2019s name would be worth a golden dragon.\nThe reek within the Great Hall was palpable by eventide. With hundreds of horses, dogs, and men squeezed underneath one roof, the floors slimy with mud and melting snow, horseshit, dog turds, and even human feces, the air redolent with the smells of wet dog, wet wool, and sodden horse blankets, there was no comfort to be found amongst the crowded benches, but there was food. The cooks served up great slabs of fresh horsemeat, charred outside and bloody red within, with roast onions and neeps\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and for once, the common soldiers ate as well as the lords and knights.\nThe horsemeat was too tough for the ruins of Theon\u2019s teeth. His attempts to chew gave him excruciating pain. So he mashed the neeps and onions up together with the flat of his dagger and made a meal of that, then cut the horse up very small, sucked on each piece, and spat it out. That way at least he had the taste, and some nourishment from the grease and blood. The bone was beyond him, though, so he tossed it to the dogs and watched Grey Jeyne make off with it whilst Sara and Willow snapped at her heels.\nLord Bolton commanded Abel to play for them as they ate. The bard sang \u201cIron Lances,\u201d then \u201cThe Winter Maid.\u201d When Barbrey Dustin asked for something more cheerful, he gave them \u201cThe Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His Crown,\u201d and \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair.\u201d The Freys joined the singing, and even a few northmen slammed their fists on the table to the chorus, bellowing, \u201cA bear! A bear!\u201d But the noise frightened the horses, so the singers soon let off and the music died away.\nThe Bastard\u2019s Boys gathered beneath a wall sconce where a torch was flaming smokily. Luton and Skinner were throwing dice. Grunt had a woman in his lap, a breast in his hand. Damon Dance-for-Me sat greasing up his whip. \u201cReek,\u201d he called. He tapped the whip against his calf as a man might do to summon his dog. \u201cYou are starting to stink again, Reek.\u201d\nTheon had no reply for that beyond a soft \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cLord Ramsay means to cut your lips off when all this is done,\u201d said Damon, stroking his whip with a greasy rag.\nMy lips have been between his lady\u2019s legs. That insolence cannot go unpunished. \u201cAs you say.\u201d\nLuton guffawed. \u201cI think he wants it.\u201d\n\u201cGo away, Reek,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cThe smell of you turns my stomach.\u201d The others laughed.\nHe fled quickly, before they changed their minds. His tormentors would not follow him outside. Not so long as there was food and drink within, willing women and warm fires. As he left the hall, Abel was singing \u201cThe Maids That Bloom in Spring.\u201d\nOutside the snow was coming down so heavily that Theon could not see more than three feet ahead of him. He found himself alone in a white wilderness, walls of snow looming up to either side of him chest high. When he raised his head, the snowflakes brushed his cheeks like cold soft kisses. He could hear the sound of music from the hall behind him. A soft song now, and sad. For a moment he felt almost at peace.\nFarther on, he came upon a man striding in the opposite direction, a hooded cloak flapping behind him. When they found themselves face-to-face their eyes met briefly. The man put a hand on his dagger. \u201cTheon Turncloak. Theon Kinslayer.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I never\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I was ironborn.\u201d\n\u201cFalse is all you were. How is it you still breathe?\u201d\n\u201cThe gods are not done with me,\u201d Theon answered, wondering if this could be the killer, the night walker who had stuffed Yellow Dick\u2019s cock into his mouth and pushed Roger Ryswell\u2019s groom off the battlements. Oddly, he was not afraid. He pulled the glove from his left hand. \u201cLord Ramsay is not done with me.\u201d\nThe man looked, and laughed. \u201cI leave you to him, then.\u201d\nTheon trudged through the storm until his arms and legs were caked with snow and his hands and feet had gone numb from cold, then climbed to the battlements of the inner wall again. Up here, a hundred feet high, a little wind was blowing, stirring the snow. All the crenels had filled up. Theon had to punch through a wall of snow to make a hole\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only to find that he could not see beyond the moat. Of the outer wall, nothing remained but a vague shadow and a few dim lights floating in the dark.\nThe world is gone. King\u2019s Landing, Riverrun, Pyke, and the Iron Islands, all the Seven Kingdoms, every place that he had ever known, every place that he had ever read about or dreamed of, all gone. Only Winterfell remained.\nHe was trapped here, with the ghosts. The old ghosts from the crypts and the younger ones that he had made himself, Mikken and Farlen, Gynir Rednose, Aggar, Gelmarr the Grim, the miller\u2019s wife from Acorn Water and her two young sons, and all the rest. My work. My ghosts. They are all here, and they are angry. He thought of the crypts and those missing swords.\nTheon returned to his own chambers. He was stripping off his wet clothes when Steelshanks Walton found him. \u201cCome with me, turncloak. His lordship wants words with you.\u201d\nHe had no clean dry clothes, so he wriggled back into the same damp rags and followed. Steelshanks led him back to the Great Keep and the solar that had once been Eddard Stark\u2019s. Lord Bolton was not alone. Lady Dustin sat with him, pale-faced and severe; an iron horsehead brooch clasped Roger Ryswell\u2019s cloak; Aenys Frey stood near the fire, pinched cheeks flushed with cold.\n\u201cI am told you have been wandering the castle,\u201d Lord Bolton began. \u201cMen have reported seeing you in the stables, in the kitchens, in the barracks, on the battlements. You have been observed near the ruins of collapsed keeps, outside Lady Catelyn\u2019s old sept, coming and going from the godswood. Do you deny it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, m\u2019lord.\u201d Theon made sure to muddy up the word. He knew that pleased Lord Bolton. \u201cI cannot sleep, m\u2019lord. I walk.\u201d He kept his head down, fixed upon the old stale rushes scattered on the floor. It was not wise to look his lordship in the face.\n\u201cI was a boy here before the war. A ward of Eddard Stark.\u201d\n\u201cYou were a hostage,\u201d Bolton said.\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord. A hostage.\u201d It was my home, though. Not a true home, but the best I ever knew.\n\u201cSomeone has been killing my men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cNot you, I trust?\u201d Bolton\u2019s voice grew even softer. \u201cYou would not repay all my kindnesses with such treachery.\u201d\n\u201cNo, m\u2019lord, not me. I wouldn\u2019t. I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0only walk, is all.\u201d\nLady Dustin spoke up. \u201cTake off your gloves.\u201d\nTheon glanced up sharply. \u201cPlease, no. I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo as she says,\u201d Ser Aenys said. \u201cShow us your hands.\u201d\nTheon peeled his gloves off and held his hands up for them to see. It is not as if I stand before them naked. It is not so bad as that. His left hand had three fingers, his right four. Ramsay had taken only the pinky off the one, the ring finger and forefingers from the other.\n\u201cThe Bastard did this to you,\u201d Lady Dustin said.\n\u201cIf it please m\u2019lady, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I asked it of him.\u201d Ramsay always made him ask. Ramsay always makes me beg.\n\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I did not need so many fingers.\u201d\n\u201cFour is enough.\u201d Ser Aenys Frey fingered the wispy brown beard that sprouted from his weak chin like a rat\u2019s tail. \u201cFour on his right hand. He could still hold a sword. A dagger.\u201d\nLady Dustin laughed. \u201cAre all Freys such fools? Look at him. Hold a dagger? He hardly has the strength to hold a spoon. Do you truly think he could have overcome the Bastard\u2019s disgusting creature and shoved his manhood down his throat?\u201d\n\u201cThese dead were all strong men,\u201d said Roger Ryswell, \u201cand none of them were stabbed. The turncloak\u2019s not our killer.\u201d\nRoose Bolton\u2019s pale eyes were fixed on Theon, as sharp as Skinner\u2019s flaying knife. \u201cI am inclined to agree. Strength aside, he does not have it in him to betray my son.\u201d\nRoger Ryswell grunted. \u201cIf not him, who? Stannis has some man inside the castle, that\u2019s plain.\u201d\nReek is no man. Not Reek. Not me. He wondered if Lady Dustin had told them about the crypts, the missing swords.\n\u201cWe must look at Manderly,\u201d muttered Ser Aenys Frey. \u201cLord Wyman loves us not.\u201d\nRyswell was not convinced. \u201cHe loves his steaks and chops and meat pies, though. Prowling the castle by dark would require him to leave the table. The only time he does that is when he seeks the privy for one of his hourlong squats.\u201d\n\u201cI do not claim Lord Wyman does the deeds himself. He brought three hundred men with him. A hundred knights. Any of them might have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNight work is not knight\u2019s work,\u201d Lady Dustin said. \u201cAnd Lord Wyman is not the only man who lost kin at your Red Wedding, Frey. Do you imagine Whoresbane loves you any better? If you did not hold the Greatjon, he would pull out your entrails and make you eat them, as Lady Hornwood ate her fingers. Flints, Cerwyns, Tallharts, Slates\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they all had men with the Young Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cHouse Ryswell too,\u201d said Roger Ryswell.\n\u201cEven Dustins out of Barrowton.\u201d Lady Dustin parted her lips in a thin, feral smile. \u201cThe north remembers, Frey.\u201d\nAenys Frey\u2019s mouth quivered with outrage. \u201cStark dishonored us. That is what you northmen had best remember.\u201d\nRoose Bolton rubbed at his chapped lips. \u201cThis squabbling will not serve.\u201d He flicked his fingers at Theon. \u201cYou are free to go. Take care where you wander. Else it might be you we find upon the morrow, smiling a red smile.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, m\u2019lord.\u201d Theon drew his gloves on over his maimed hands and took his leave, limping on his maimed foot.\nThe hour of the wolf found him still awake, wrapped in layers of heavy wool and greasy fur, walking yet another circuit of the inner walls, hoping to exhaust himself enough to sleep. His legs were caked with snow to the knee, his head and shoulders shrouded in white. On this stretch of the wall the wind was in his face, and melting snow ran down his cheeks like icy tears.\nThen he heard the horn.\nA long low moan, it seemed to hang above the battlements, lingering in the black air, soaking deep into the bones of every man who heard it. All along the castle walls, sentries turned toward the sound, their hands tightening around the shafts of their spears. In the ruined halls and keeps of Winterfell, lords hushed other lords, horses nickered, and sleepers stirred in their dark corners. No sooner had the sound of the warhorn died away than a drum began to beat: BOOM doom BOOM doom BOOM doom. And a name passed from the lips of each man to the next, written in small white puffs of breath. Stannis, they whispered, Stannis is here, Stannis is come, Stannis, Stannis, Stannis.\nTheon shivered. Baratheon or Bolton, it made no matter to him. Stannis had made common cause with Jon Snow at the Wall, and Jon would take his head off in a heartbeat. Plucked from the clutches of one bastard to die at the hands of another, what a jape. Theon would have laughed aloud if he\u2019d remembered how.\nThe drumming seemed to be coming from the wolfswood beyond the Hunter\u2019s Gate. They are just outside the walls. Theon made his way along the wallwalk, one more man amongst a score doing the same. But even when they reached the towers that flanked the gate itself, there was nothing to be seen beyond the veil of white.\n\u201cDo they mean to try and blow our walls down?\u201d japed a Flint when the warhorn sounded once again. \u201cMayhaps he thinks he\u2019s found the Horn of Joramun.\u201d\n\u201cIs Stannis fool enough to storm the castle?\u201d a sentry asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not Robert,\u201d declared a Barrowton man. \u201cHe\u2019ll sit, see if he don\u2019t. Try and starve us out.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll freeze his balls off first,\u201d another sentry said.\n\u201cWe should take the fight to him,\u201d declared a Frey.\nDo that, Theon thought. Ride out into the snow and die. Leave Winterfell to me and the ghosts. Roose Bolton would welcome such a fight, he sensed. He needs an end to this. The castle was too crowded to withstand a long siege, and too many of the lords here were of uncertain loyalty. Fat Wyman Manderly, Whoresbane Umber, the men of House Hornwood and House Tallhart, the Lockes and Flints and Ryswells, all of them were northmen, sworn to House Stark for generations beyond count. It was the girl who held them here, Lord Eddard\u2019s blood, but the girl was just a mummer\u2019s ploy, a lamb in a direwolf\u2019s skin. So why not send the northmen forth to battle Stannis before the farce unraveled? Slaughter in the snow. And every man who falls is one less foe for the Dreadfort.\nTheon wondered if he might be allowed to fight. Then at least he might die a man\u2019s death, sword in hand. That was a gift Ramsay would never give him, but Lord Roose might. If I beg him. I did all he asked of me, I played my part, I gave the girl away.\nDeath was the sweetest deliverance he could hope for.\nIn the godswood the snow was still dissolving as it touched the earth. Steam rose off the hot pools, fragrant with the smell of moss and mud and decay. A warm fog hung in the air, turning the trees into sentinels, tall soldiers shrouded in cloaks of gloom. During daylight hours, the steamy wood was often full of northmen come to pray to the old gods, but at this hour Theon Greyjoy found he had it all to himself.\nAnd in the heart of the wood the weirwood waited with its knowing red eyes. Theon stopped by the edge of the pool and bowed his head before its carved red face. Even here he could hear the drumming, boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM. Like distant thunder, the sound seemed to come from everywhere at once.\nThe night was windless, the snow drifting straight down out of a cold black sky, yet the leaves of the heart tree were rustling his name. \u201cTheon,\u201d they seemed to whisper, \u201cTheon.\u201d\nThe old gods, he thought. They know me. They know my name. I was Theon of House Greyjoy. I was a ward of Eddard Stark, a friend and brother to his children. \u201cPlease.\u201d He fell to his knees. \u201cA sword, that\u2019s all I ask. Let me die as Theon, not as Reek.\u201d Tears trickled down his cheeks, impossibly warm. \u201cI was ironborn. A son\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a son of Pyke, of the islands.\u201d\nA leaf drifted down from above, brushed his brow, and landed in the pool. It floated on the water, red, five-fingered, like a bloody hand. \u201c\u2026\u00a0Bran,\u201d the tree murmured.\nThey know. The gods know. They saw what I did. And for one strange moment it seemed as if it were Bran\u2019s face carved into the pale trunk of the weirwood, staring down at him with eyes red and wise and sad. Bran\u2019s ghost, he thought, but that was madness. Why should Bran want to haunt him? He had been fond of the boy, had never done him any harm. It was not Bran we killed. It was not Rickon. They were only miller\u2019s sons, from the mill by the Acorn Water. \u201cI had to have two heads, else they would have mocked me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0laughed at me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nA voice said, \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\nTheon spun, terrified that Ramsay had found him, but it was just the washerwomen\u2014Holly, Rowan, and one whose name he did not know. \u201cThe ghosts,\u201d he blurted. \u201cThey whisper to me. They\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they know my name.\u201d\n\u201cTheon Turncloak.\u201d Rowan grabbed his ear, twisting. \u201cYou had to have two heads, did you?\u201d\n\u201cElsewise men would have laughed at him,\u201d said Holly.\nThey do not understand. Theon wrenched free. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the third washerwoman, an older woman, deep-voiced, with grey streaks in her hair.\n\u201cI told you. I want to touch you, turncloak.\u201d Holly smiled. In her hand a blade appeared.\nI could scream, Theon thought. Someone will hear. The castle is full of armed men. He would be dead before help reached him, to be sure, his blood soaking into the ground to feed the heart tree. And what would be so wrong with that? \u201cTouch me,\u201d he said. \u201cKill me.\u201d There was more despair than defiance in his voice. \u201cGo on. Do me, the way you did the others. Yellow Dick and the rest. It was you.\u201d\nHolly laughed. \u201cHow could it be us? We\u2019re women. Teats and cunnies. Here to be fucked, not feared.\u201d\n\u201cDid the Bastard hurt you?\u201d Rowan asked. \u201cChopped off your fingers, did he? Skinned your widdle toes? Knocked your teeth out? Poor lad.\u201d She patted his cheek. \u201cThere will be no more o\u2019 that, I promise. You prayed, and the gods sent us. You want to die as Theon? We\u2019ll give you that. A nice quick death, \u2019twill hardly hurt at all.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut not till you\u2019ve sung for Abel. He\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d",

      "content": "TYRION\nLot ninety-seven.\u201d The auctioneer snapped his whip. \u201cA pair of dwarfs, well trained for your amusement.\u201d\nThe auction block had been thrown up where the broad brown Skahazadhan flowed into Slaver\u2019s Bay. Tyrion Lannister could smell the salt in the air, mingled with the stink from the latrine ditches behind the slave pens. He did not mind the heat so much as he did the damp. The very air seemed to weigh him down, like a warm wet blanket across his head and shoulders.\n\u201cDog and pig included in lot,\u201d the auctioneer announced. \u201cThe dwarfs ride them. Delight the guests at your next feast or use them for a folly.\u201d\nThe bidders sat on wooden benches sipping fruit drinks. A few were being fanned by slaves. Many wore tokars, that peculiar garment beloved by the old blood of Slaver\u2019s Bay, as elegant as it was impractical. Others dressed more plainly\u2014men in tunics and hooded cloaks, women in colored silks. Whores or priestesses, most like; this far east it was hard to tell the two apart.\nBack behind the benches, trading japes and making mock of the proceedings, stood a clot of westerners. Sellswords, Tyrion knew. He spied longswords, dirks and daggers, a brace of throwing axes, mail beneath their cloaks. Their hair and beards and faces marked most for men of the Free Cities, but here and there were a few who might have been Westerosi. Are they buying? Or did they just turn up for the show?\n\u201cWho will open for this pair?\u201d\n\u201cThree hundred,\u201d bid a matron on an antique palanquin.\n\u201cFour,\u201d called a monstrously fat Yunkishman from the litter where he sprawled like a leviathan. Covered all in yellow silk fringed with gold, he looked as large as four Illyrios. Tyrion pitied the slaves who had to carry him. At least we will be spared that duty. What joy to be a dwarf.\n\u201cAnd one,\u201d said a crone in a violet tokar. The auctioneer gave her a sour look but did not disallow the bid.\nThe slave sailors off the Selaesori Qhoran, sold singly, had gone for prices ranging from five hundred to nine hundred pieces of silver. Seasoned seamen were a valuable commodity. None had put up any sort of fight when the slavers boarded their crippled cog. For them this was just a change of owner. The ship\u2019s mates had been free men, but the widow of the waterfront had written them a binder, promising to stand their ransom in such a case as this. The three surviving fiery fingers had not been sold yet, but they were chattels of the Lord of Light and could count on being bought back by some red temple. The flames tattooed upon their faces were their binders.\nTyrion and Penny had no such reassurance.\n\u201cFour-fifty,\u201d came the bid.\n\u201cFour-eighty.\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred.\u201d\nSome bids were called out in High Valyrian, some in the mongrel tongue of Ghis. A few buyers signaled with a finger, the twist of a wrist, or the wave of a painted fan.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they are keeping us together,\u201d Penny whispered.\nThe slave trader shot them a look. \u201cNo talk.\u201d\nTyrion gave Penny\u2019s shoulder a squeeze. Strands of hair, pale blond and black, clung to his brow, the rags of his tunic to his back. Some of that was sweat, some dried blood. He had not been so foolish as to fight the slavers, as Jorah Mormont had, but that did not mean he had escaped punishment. In his case it was his mouth that earned him lashes.\n\u201cEight hundred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd fifty.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one.\u201d\nWe\u2019re worth as much as a sailor, Tyrion mused. Though perhaps it was Pretty Pig the buyers wanted. A well-trained pig is hard to find. They certainly were not bidding by the pound.\nAt nine hundred pieces of silver, the bidding began to slow. At nine hundred fifty-one (from the crone), it stopped. The auctioneer had the scent, though, and nothing would do but that the dwarfs give the crowd a taste of their show. Crunch and Pretty Pig were led up onto the platform. Without saddles or bridles, mounting them proved tricky. The moment the sow began to move Tyrion slid off her rump and landed on his own, provoking gales of laughter from the bidders.\n\u201cOne thousand,\u201d bid the grotesque fat man.\n\u201cAnd one.\u201d The crone again.\nPenny\u2019s mouth was frozen in a rictus of a smile. Well trained for your amusement. Her father had a deal to answer for, in whatever small hell was reserved for dwarfs.\n\u201cTwelve hundred.\u201d The leviathan in yellow. A slave beside him handed him a drink. Lemon, no doubt. The way those yellow eyes were fixed upon the block made Tyrion uncomfortable.\n\u201cThirteen hundred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one.\u201d The crone.\nMy father always said a Lannister was worth ten times as much as any common man.\nAt sixteen hundred the pace began to flag again, so the slave trader invited some of the buyers to come up for a closer look at the dwarfs. \u201cThe female\u2019s young,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou could breed the two of them, get good coin for the whelps.\u201d\n\u201cHalf his nose is gone,\u201d complained the crone once she\u2019d had a good close look. Her wrinkled face puckered with displeasure. Her flesh was maggot white; wrapped in the violet tokar, she looked like a prune gone to mold. \u201cHis eyes don\u2019t match neither. An ill-favored thing.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady hasn\u2019t seen my best part yet.\u201d Tyrion grabbed his crotch, in case she missed his meaning.\nThe hag hissed in outrage, and Tyrion got a lick of the whip across his back, a stinging cut that drove him to his knees. The taste of blood filled his mouth. He grinned and spat.\n\u201cTwo thousand,\u201d called a new voice, back of the benches.\nAnd what would a sellsword want with a dwarf? Tyrion pushed himself back to his feet to get a better look. The new bidder was an older man, white-haired yet tall and fit, with leathery brown skin and a close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard. Half-hidden under a faded purple cloak were a longsword and a brace of daggers.\n\u201cTwenty-five hundred.\u201d A female voice this time; a girl, short, with a thick waist and heavy bosom, clad in ornate armor. Her sculpted black steel breastplate was inlaid in gold and showed a harpy rising with chains dangling from her claws. A pair of slave soldiers lifted her to shoulder height on a shield.\n\u201cThree thousand.\u201d The brown-skinned man pushed through the crowd, his fellow sellswords shoving buyers aside to clear a path. Yes. Come closer. Tyrion knew how to deal with sellswords. He did not think for a moment that this man wanted him to frolic at feasts. He knows me. He means to take me back to Westeros and sell me to my sister. The dwarf rubbed his mouth to hide his smile. Cersei and the Seven Kingdoms were half a world away. Much and more could happen before he got there. I turned Bronn. Give me half a chance, might be I could turn this one too.\nThe crone and the girl on the shield gave up the chase at three thousand, but not the fat man in yellow. He weighed the sellswords with his yellow eyes, flicked his tongue across his yellow teeth, and said, \u201cFive thousand silvers for the lot.\u201d\nThe sellsword frowned, shrugged, turned away.\nSeven hells. Tyrion was quite certain that he did not want to become the property of the immense Lord Yellowbelly. Just the sight of him sagging across his litter, a mountain of sallow flesh with piggy yellow eyes and breasts big as Pretty Pig pushing at the silk of his tokar was enough to make the dwarf\u2019s skin crawl. And the smell wafting off him was palpable even on the block.\n\u201cIf there are no further bids\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSeven thousand,\u201d shouted Tyrion.\nLaughter rippled across the benches. \u201cThe dwarf wants to buy himself,\u201d the girl on the shield observed.\nTyrion gave her a lascivious grin. \u201cA clever slave deserves a clever master, and you lot all look like fools.\u201d\nThat provoked more laughter from the bidders, and a scowl from the auctioneer, who was fingering his whip indecisively as he tried to puzzle out whether this would work to his benefit.\n\u201cFive thousand is an insult!\u201d Tyrion called out. \u201cI joust, I sing, I say amusing things. I\u2019ll fuck your wife and make her scream. Or your enemy\u2019s wife if you prefer, what better way to shame him? I\u2019m murder with a crossbow, and men three times my size quail and tremble when we meet across a cyvasse table. I have even been known to cook from time to time. I bid ten thousand silvers for myself! I\u2019m good for it, I am, I am. My father told me I must always pay my debts.\u201d\nThe sellsword in the purple cloak turned back. His eyes met Tyrion\u2019s across the rows of other bidders, and he smiled. A warm smile, that, the dwarf reflected. Friendly. But my, those eyes are cold. Might be I don\u2019t want him to buy us after all.\nThe yellow enormity was squirming in his litter, a look of annoyance on his huge pie face. He muttered something sour in Ghiscari that Tyrion did not understand, but the tone of it was plain enough. \u201cWas that another bid?\u201d The dwarf cocked his head. \u201cI offer all the gold of Casterly Rock.\u201d\nHe heard the whip before he felt it, a whistle in the air, thin and sharp. Tyrion grunted under the blow, but this time he managed to stay on his feet. His thoughts flashed back to the beginnings of his journey, when his most pressing problem had been deciding which wine to drink with his midmorning snails. See what comes of chasing dragons. A laugh burst from his lips, spattering the first row of buyers with blood and spit.\n\u201cYou are sold,\u201d the auctioneer announced. Then he hit him again, just because he could. This time Tyrion went down.\nOne of the guards yanked him back to his feet. Another prodded Penny down off the platform with the butt of his spear. The next piece of chattel was already being led up to take their place. A girl, fifteen or sixteen, not off the Selaesori Qhoran this time. Tyrion did not know her. The same age as Daenerys Targaryen, or near enough. The slaver soon had her naked. At least we were spared that humiliation.\nTyrion gazed across the Yunkish camp to the walls of Meereen. Those gates looked so close\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and if the talk in the slave pens could be believed, Meereen remained a free city for the nonce. Within those crumbling walls, slavery and the slave trade were still forbidden. All he had to do was reach those gates and pass beyond, and he would be a free man again.\nBut that was hardly possible unless he abandoned Penny. She\u2019d want to take the dog and the pig along.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be so terrible, will it?\u201d Penny whispered. \u201cHe paid so much for us. He\u2019ll be kind, won\u2019t he?\u201d\nSo long as we amuse him. \u201cWe\u2019re too valuable to mistreat,\u201d he reassured her, with blood still trickling down his back from those last two lashes. When our show grows stale, however\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and it does, it does grow stale\u00a0\u2026\nTheir master\u2019s overseer was waiting to take charge of them, with a mule cart and two soldiers. He had a long narrow face and a chin beard bound about with golden wire, and his stiff red-black hair swept out from his temples to form a pair of taloned hands. \u201cWhat darling little creatures you are,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remind me of my own children\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or would, if my little ones were not dead. I shall take good care of you. Tell me your names.\u201d\n\u201cPenny.\u201d Her voice was a whisper, small and scared.\nTyrion, of House Lannister, rightful lord of Casterly Rock, you sniveling worm. \u201cYollo.\u201d\n\u201cBold Yollo. Bright Penny. You are the property of the noble and valorous Yezzan zo Qaggaz, scholar and warrior, revered amongst the Wise Masters of Yunkai. Count yourselves fortunate, for Yezzan is a kindly and benevolent master. Think of him as you would your father.\u201d\nGladly, thought Tyrion, but this time he held his tongue. They would have to perform for their new master soon enough, he did not doubt, and he could not take another lash.\n\u201cYour father loves his special treasures best of all, and he will cherish you,\u201d the overseer was saying. \u201cAnd me, think of me as you would the nurse who cared for you when you were small. Nurse is what all my children call me.\u201d\n\u201cLot ninety-nine,\u201d the auctioneer called. \u201cA warrior.\u201d\nThe girl had sold quickly and was being bundled off to her new owner, clutching her clothing to small, pink-tipped breasts. Two slavers dragged Jorah Mormont onto the block to take her place. The knight was naked but for a breechclout, his back raw from the whip, his face so swollen as to be almost unrecognizable. Chains bound his wrists and ankles. A little taste of the meal he cooked for me, Tyrion thought, yet he found that he could take no pleasure from the big knight\u2019s miseries.\nEven in chains, Mormont looked dangerous, a hulking brute with big, thick arms and sloped shoulders. All that coarse dark hair on his chest made him look more beast than man. Both his eyes were blackened, two dark pits in that grotesquely swollen face. Upon one cheek he bore a brand: a demon\u2019s mask.\nWhen the slavers had swarmed aboard the Selaesori Qhoran, Ser Jorah had met them with longsword in hand, slaying three before they overwhelmed him. Their shipmates would gladly have killed him, but the captain forbade it; a fighter was always worth good silver. So Mormont had been chained to an oar, beaten within an inch of his life, starved, and branded.\n\u201cBig and strong, this one,\u201d the auctioneer declared. \u201cPlenty of piss in him. He\u2019ll give a good show in the fighting pits. Who will start me out at three hundred?\u201d\nNo one would.\nMormont paid no mind to the mongrel crowd; his eyes were fixed beyond the siege lines, on the distant city with its ancient walls of many-colored brick. Tyrion could read that look as easy as a book: so near and yet so distant. The poor wretch had returned too late. Daenerys Targaryen was wed, the guards on the pens had told them, laughing. She had taken a Meereenese slaver as her king, as wealthy as he was noble, and when the peace was signed and sealed the fighting pits of Meereen would open once again. Other slaves insisted that the guards were lying, that Daenerys Targaryen would never make peace with slavers. Mhysa, they called her. Someone told him that meant Mother. Soon the silver queen would come forth from her city, smash the Yunkai\u2019i, and break their chains, they whispered to one another.\nAnd then she\u2019ll bake us all a lemon pie and kiss our widdle wounds and make them better, the dwarf thought. He had no faith in royal rescues. If need be, he would see to their deliverance himself. The mushrooms jammed into the toe of his boot should be sufficient for both him and Penny. Crunch and Pretty Pig would need to fend for themselves.\nNurse was still lecturing his master\u2019s new prizes. \u201cDo all you are told and nothing more, and you shall live like little lords, pampered and adored,\u201d he promised. \u201cDisobey\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but you would never do that, would you? Not my sweetlings.\u201d He reached down and pinched Penny on her cheek.\n\u201cTwo hundred, then,\u201d the auctioneer said. \u201cA big brute like this, he\u2019s worth three times as much. What a bodyguard he will make! No enemy will dare molest you!\u201d\n\u201cCome, my little friends,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cI will show you to your new home. In Yunkai you will dwell in the golden pyramid of Qaggaz and dine off silver plates, but here we live simply, in the humble tents of soldiers.\u201d\n\u201cWho will give me one hundred?\u201d cried the auctioneer.\nThat drew a bid at last, though it was only fifty silvers. The bidder was a thin man in a leather apron.\n\u201cAnd one,\u201d said the crone in the violet tokar.\nOne of the soldiers lifted Penny onto the back of the mule cart. \u201cWho is the old woman?\u201d the dwarf asked him.\n\u201cZahrina,\u201d the man said. \u201cCheap fighters, hers. Meat for heroes. Your friend dead soon.\u201d\nHe was no friend to me. Yet Tyrion Lannister found himself turning to Nurse and saying, \u201cYou cannot let her have him.\u201d\nNurse squinted at him. \u201cWhat is this noise you make?\u201d\nTyrion pointed. \u201cThat one is part of our show. The bear and the maiden fair. Jorah is the bear, Penny is the maiden, I am the brave knight who rescues her. I dance about and hit him in the balls. Very funny.\u201d\nThe overseer squinted at the auction block. \u201cHim?\u201d The bidding for Jorah Mormont had reached two hundred silvers.\n\u201cAnd one,\u201d said the crone in the violet tokar.\n\u201cYour bear. I see.\u201d Nurse went scuttling off through the crowd, bent over the huge yellow Yunkishman in his litter, whispered in his ear. His master nodded, chins wobbling, then raised his fan. \u201cThree hundred,\u201d he called out in a wheezy voice.\nThe crone sniffed and turned away.\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Penny asked, in the Common Tongue.\nA fair question, thought Tyrion. Why did I? \u201cYour show was growing dull. Every mummer needs a dancing bear.\u201d\nShe gave him a reproachful look, then retreated to the back of the cart and sat with her arms around Crunch, as if the dog was her last true friend in the world. Perhaps he is.\nNurse returned with Jorah Mormont. Two of their master\u2019s slave soldiers flung him into the back of the mule cart between the dwarfs. The knight did not struggle. All the fight went out of him when he heard that his queen had wed, Tyrion realized. One whispered word had done what fists and whips and clubs could not; it had broken him. I should have let the crone have him. He\u2019s going to be as useful as nipples on a breastplate.\nNurse climbed onto the front of the mule cart and took up the reins, and they set off through the siege camp to the compound of their new master, the noble Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Four slave soldiers marched beside them, two on either side of the cart.\nPenny did not weep, but her eyes were red and miserable, and she never lifted them from Crunch. Does she think all this might fade away if she does not look at it? Ser Jorah Mormont looked at no one and nothing. He sat huddled, brooding in his chains.\nTyrion looked at everything and everyone.\nThe Yunkish encampment was not one camp but a hundred camps raised up cheek by jowl in a crescent around the walls of Meereen, a city of silk and canvas with its own avenues and alleys, taverns and trollops, good districts and bad. Between the siege lines and the bay, tents had sprouted up like yellow mushrooms. Some were small and mean, no more than a flap of old stained canvas to keep off the rain and sun, but beside them stood barracks tents large enough to sleep a hundred men and silken pavilions as big as palaces with harpies gleaming atop their roof poles. Some camps were orderly, with the tents arrayed around a fire pit in concentric circles, weapons and armor stacked around the inner ring, horse lines outside. Elsewhere, pure chaos seemed to reign.\nThe dry, scorched plains around Meereen were flat and bare and treeless for long leagues, but the Yunkish ships had brought lumber and hides up from the south, enough to raise six huge trebuchets. They were arrayed on three sides of the city, all but the river side, surrounded by piles of broken stone and casks of pitch and resin just waiting for a torch. One of the soldiers walking along beside the cart saw where Tyrion was looking and proudly told him that each of the trebuchets had been given a name: Dragonbreaker, Harridan, Harpy\u2019s Daughter, Wicked Sister, Ghost of Astapor, Mazdhan\u2019s Fist. Towering above the tents to a height of forty feet, the trebuchets were the siege camp\u2019s chief landmarks. \u201cJust the sight of them drove the dragon queen to her knees,\u201d he boasted. \u201cAnd there she will stay, sucking Hizdahr\u2019s noble cock, else we smash her walls to rubble.\u201d\nTyrion saw a slave being whipped, blow after blow, until his back was nothing but blood and raw meat. A file of men marched past in irons, clanking with every step; they carried spears and wore short swords, but chains linked them wrist to wrist and ankle to ankle. The air smelled of roasting meat, and he saw one man skinning a dog for his stewpot.\nHe saw the dead as well, and heard the dying. Under the drifting smoke, the smell of horses, and the sharp salt tang of the bay was a stink of blood and shit. Some flux, he realized, as he watched two sellswords carry the corpse of a third from one of the tents. That made his fingers twitch. Disease could wipe out an army quicker than any battle, he had heard his father say once.\nAll the more reason to escape, and soon.\nA quarter mile on, he found good reason to reconsider. A crowd had formed around three slaves taken whilst trying to escape. \u201cI know my little treasures will be sweet and obedient,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cSee what befalls ones who try to run.\u201d\nThe captives had been tied to a row of crossbeams, and a pair of slingers were using them to test their skills. \u201cTolosi,\u201d one of the guards told them. \u201cThe best slingers in the world. They throw soft lead balls in place of stones.\u201d\nTyrion had never seen the point of slings, when bows had so much better range\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he had never seen Tolosi at work before. Their lead balls did vastly more damage then the smooth stones other slingers used, and more than any bow as well. One struck the knee of one of the captives, and it burst apart in a gout of blood and bone that left the man\u2019s lower leg dangling by a rope of dark red tendon. Well, he won\u2019t run again, Tyrion allowed, as the man began to scream. His shrieks mingled in the morning air with the laughter of camp followers and the curses of those who\u2019d wagered good coin that the slinger would miss. Penny looked away, but Nurse grasped her under the chin and twisted her head back around. \u201cWatch,\u201d he commanded. \u201cYou too, bear.\u201d\nJorah Mormont raised his head and stared at Nurse. Tyrion could see the tightness in his arms. He\u2019s going to throttle him, and that will be the end for all of us. But the knight only grimaced, then turned to watch the bloody show.\nTo the east the massive brick walls of Meereen shimmered through the morning heat. That was the refuge these poor fools had hoped to reach. How long will it remain a refuge, though?\nAll three of the would-be escapees were dead before Nurse gathered up the reins again. The mule cart rumbled on.\nTheir master\u2019s camp was south and east of the Harridan, almost in its shadow, and spread over several acres. The humble tent of Yezzan zo Qaggaz proved to be a palace of lemon-colored silk. Gilded harpies stood atop the center poles of each of its nine peaked roofs, shining in the sun. Lesser tents ringed it on all sides. \u201cThose are the dwellings of our noble master\u2019s cooks, concubines, and warriors, and a few less-favored kinsmen,\u201d Nurse told them, \u201cbut you little darlings shall have the rare privilege of sleeping within Yezzan\u2019s own pavilion. It pleases him to keep his treasures close.\u201d He frowned at Mormont. \u201cNot you, bear. You are big and ugly, you will be chained outside.\u201d The knight did not respond. \u201cFirst, all of you must be fitted for collars.\u201d\nThe collars were made of iron, lightly gilded to make them glitter in the light. Yezzan\u2019s name was incised into the metal in Valyrian glyphs, and a pair of tiny bells were affixed below the ears, so the wearer\u2019s every step produced a merry little tinkling sound. Jorah Mormont accepted his collar in a sullen silence, but Penny began to cry as the armorer was fastening her own into place. \u201cIt\u2019s so heavy,\u201d she complained.\nTyrion squeezed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s solid gold,\u201d he lied. \u201cIn Westeros, highborn ladies dream of such a necklace.\u201d Better a collar than a brand. A collar can be removed. He remembered Shae, and the way the golden chain had glimmered as he twisted it tighter and tighter about her throat.\nAfterward, Nurse had Ser Jorah\u2019s chains fastened to a stake near the cookfire whilst he escorted the two dwarfs inside the master\u2019s pavilion and showed them where they would sleep, in a carpeted alcove separated from the main tent by walls of yellow silk. They would share this space with Yezzan\u2019s other treasures: a boy with twisted, hairy \u201cgoat legs,\u201d a two-headed girl out of Mantarys, a bearded woman, and a willowy creature called Sweets who dressed in moonstones and Myrish lace. \u201cYou are trying to decide if I\u2019m a man or woman,\u201d Sweets said, when she was brought before the dwarfs. Then she lifted her skirts and showed them what was underneath. \u201cI\u2019m both, and master loves me best.\u201d\nA grotesquerie, Tyrion realized. Somewhere some god is laughing. \u201cLovely,\u201d he said to Sweets, who had purple hair and violet eyes, \u201cbut we were hoping to be the pretty ones for once.\u201d\nSweets sniggered, but Nurse was not amused. \u201cSave your japes for this evening, when you perform for our noble master. If you please him, you will be well rewarded. If not\u00a0\u2026\u201d He slapped Tyrion across the face.\n\u201cYou will want to be careful with Nurse,\u201d said Sweets when the overseer had departed. \u201cHe is the only true monster here.\u201d The bearded woman spoke an incomprehensible variety of Ghiscari, the goat boy some guttural sailor\u2019s pidgin called the trade talk. The two-headed girl was feebleminded; one head was no bigger than an orange and did not speak at all, the other had filed teeth and was like to growl at anyone who came too close to her cage. But Sweets was fluent in four tongues, one of them High Valyrian.\n\u201cWhat is the master like?\u201d Penny asked, anxiously.\n\u201cHis eyes are yellow, and he stinks,\u201d said Sweets. \u201cTen years ago he went to Sothoros, and he has been rotting from the inside out ever since. Make him forget that he is dying, even for a little while, and he can be most generous. Deny him nothing.\u201d\nThey had only the afternoon to learn the ways of chattel. Yezzan\u2019s body slaves filled a tub with hot water, and the dwarfs were allowed to bathe\u2014Penny first, then Tyrion. Afterward another slave spread a stinging ointment across the cuts on his back to keep them from mortifying, then covered them with a cool poultice. Penny\u2019s hair was cut, and Tyrion\u2019s beard got a trim. They were given soft slippers and fresh clothing, plain but clean.\nAs evening fell, Nurse returned to tell them that it was time to don their mummer\u2019s plate. Yezzan would be hosting the Yunkish supreme commander, the noble Yurkhaz zo Yunzak, and they would be expected to perform. \u201cShall we unchain your bear?\u201d\n\u201cNot this night,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cLet us joust for our master first and save the bear for some other time.\u201d\n\u201cJust so. After your capers are concluded, you will help serve and pour. See that you do not spill on the guests, or it will go ill for you.\u201d\nA juggler began the evening\u2019s frolics. Then came a trio of energetic tumblers. After them the goat-legged boy came out and did a grotesque jig whilst one of Yurkhaz\u2019s slaves played on a bone flute. Tyrion had half a mind to ask him if he knew \u201cThe Rains of Castamere.\u201d As they waited their own turn to perform, he watched Yezzan and his guests. The human prune in the place of honor was evidently the Yunkish supreme commander, who looked about as formidable as a loose stool. A dozen other Yunkish lords attended him. Two sellsword captains were on hand as well, each accompanied by a dozen men of his company. One was an elegant Pentoshi, grey-haired and clad in silk but for his cloak, a ragged thing sewn from dozens of strips of torn, bloodstained cloth. The other captain was the man who\u2019d tried to buy them that morning, the brown-skinned bidder with the salt-and-pepper beard. \u201cBrown Ben Plumm,\u201d Sweets named him. \u201cCaptain of the Second Sons.\u201d\nA Westerosi, and a Plumm. Better and better.\n\u201cYou are next,\u201d Nurse informed them. \u201cBe amusing, my little darlings, or you will wish you had.\u201d\nTyrion had not mastered half of Groat\u2019s old tricks, but he could ride the sow, fall off when he was meant to, roll, and pop back onto his feet. All of that proved well received. The sight of little people running about drunkenly and whacking at one another with wooden weapons appeared to be just as hilarious in a siege camp by Slaver\u2019s Bay as at Joffrey\u2019s wedding feast in King\u2019s Landing. Contempt, thought Tyrion, the universal tongue.\nTheir master Yezzan laughed loudest and longest whenever one of his dwarfs suffered a fall or took a blow, his whole vast body shaking like suet in an earthquake; his guests waited to see how Yurkhaz no Yunzak responded before joining in. The supreme commander appeared so frail that Tyrion was afraid laughing might kill him. When Penny\u2019s helm was struck off and flew into the lap of a sour-faced Yunkishman in a striped green-and-gold tokar, Yurkhaz cackled like a chicken. When said lord reached inside the helm and drew out a large purple melon dribbling pulp, he wheezed until his face turned the same color as the fruit. He turned to his host and whispered something that made their master chortle and lick his lips\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though there was a hint of anger in those slitted yellow eyes, it seemed to Tyrion.\nAfterward the dwarfs stripped off their wooden armor and the sweat-soaked clothing beneath and changed into the fresh yellow tunics that had been provided them for serving. Tyrion was given a flagon of purple wine, Penny a flagon of water. They moved about the tent filling cups, their slippered feet whispering over thick carpets. It was harder work than it appeared. Before long his legs were cramping badly, and one of the cuts on his back had begun to bleed again, the red seeping through the yellow linen of his tunic. Tyrion bit his tongue and kept on pouring.\nMost of the guests paid them no more mind than they did the other slaves\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but one Yunkishman declared drunkenly that Yezzan should make the two dwarfs fuck, and another demanded to know how Tyrion had lost his nose. I shoved it up your wife\u2019s cunt and she bit it off, he almost replied\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the storm had persuaded him that he did not want to die as yet, so instead he said, \u201cIt was cut off to punish me for insolence, lord.\u201d\nThen a lord in a blue tokar fringed with tiger\u2019s eyes recalled that Tyrion had boasted of his skill at cyvasse on the auction block. \u201cLet us put him to the test,\u201d he said. A table and set of pieces was duly produced. A scant few moments later, the red-faced lord shoved the table over in fury, scattering the pieces across the carpets to the sound of Yunkish laughter.\n\u201cYou should have let him win,\u201d Penny whispered.\nBrown Ben Plumm lifted the fallen table, smiling. \u201cTry me next, dwarf. When I was younger, the Second Sons took contract with Volantis. I learned the game there.\u201d\n\u201cI am only a slave. My noble master decides when and who I play.\u201d Tyrion turned to Yezzan. \u201cMaster?\u201d\nThe yellow lord seemed amused by the notion. \u201cWhat stakes do you propose, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cIf I win, give this slave to me,\u201d said Plumm.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yezzan zo Qaggaz said. \u201cBut if you can defeat my dwarf, you may have the price I paid for him, in gold.\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d the sellsword said. The scattered pieces were picked up off the carpet, and they sat down to play.\nTyrion won the first game. Plumm took the second, for double the stakes. As they set up for their third contest, the dwarf studied his opponent. Brown-skinned, his cheeks and jaw covered by a close-cropped bristly beard of grey and white, his face creased by a thousand wrinkles and a few old scars, Plumm had an amiable look to him, especially when he smiled. The faithful retainer, Tyrion decided. Every man\u2019s favorite nuncle, full of chuckles and old sayings and roughspun wisdom. It was all sham. Those smiles never touched Plumm\u2019s eyes, where greed hid behind a veil of caution. Hungry, but wary, this one.\nThe sellsword was nearly as bad a player as the Yunkish lord had been, but his play was stolid and tenacious rather than bold. His opening arrays were different every time, yet all the same\u2014conservative, defensive, passive. He does not play to win, Tyrion realized. He plays so as not to lose. It worked in their second game, when the little man overreached himself with an unsound assault. It did not work in the third game, nor the fourth, nor the fifth, which proved to be their last.\nNear the end of that final contest, with his fortress in ruins, his dragon dead, elephants before him and heavy horse circling round his rear, Plumm looked up smiling and said, \u201cYollo wins again. Death in four.\u201d\n\u201cThree.\u201d Tyrion tapped his dragon. \u201cI was lucky. Perhaps you should give my head a good rub before our next game, Captain. Some of that luck might rub off on your fingers.\u201d You will still lose, but you might give me a better game. Grinning, he pushed back from the cyvasse table, picked up his wine flagon, and returned to pouring with Yezzan zo Qaggaz considerably richer and Brown Ben Plumm considerably impoverished. His gargantuan master had fallen off into drunken sleep during the third game, his goblet slipping from his yellowed fingers to spill its contents on the carpet, but perhaps he would be pleased when he awakened.\nWhen the supreme commander Yurkhaz zo Yunzak departed, supported by a pair of burly slaves, that seemed to be a general signal for the other guests to take their leaves as well. After the tent had emptied out, Nurse reappeared to tell the servers that they might make their own feast from the leavings. \u201cEat quickly. All this must be clean again before you sleep.\u201d\nTyrion was on his knees, his legs aching and his bloody back screaming with pain, trying to scrub out the stain that the noble Yezzan\u2019s spilled wine had left upon the noble Yezzan\u2019s carpet, when the overseer tapped his cheek gently with the end of his whip. \u201cYollo. You have done well. You and your wife.\u201d\n\u201cShe is not my wife.\u201d\n\u201cYour whore, then. On your feet, both of you.\u201d\nTyrion rose unsteadily, one leg trembling beneath him. His thighs were knots, so cramped that Penny had to lend him a hand to pull him to his feet. \u201cWhat have we done?\u201d\n\u201cMuch and more,\u201d said the overseer. \u201cNurse said you would be rewarded if you pleased your father, did he not? Though the noble Yezzan is loath to lose his little treasures, as you have seen, Yurkhaz zo Yunzak persuaded him that it would be selfish to keep such droll antics to himself. Rejoice! To celebrate the signing of the peace, you shall have the honor of jousting in the Great Pit of Daznak. Thousands will come see you! Tens of thousands! And, oh, how we shall laugh!\u201d",

      "content": "JAIME\nRaventree Hall was old. Moss grew thick between its ancient stones, spiderwebbing up its walls like the veins in a crone\u2019s legs. Two huge towers flanked the castle\u2019s main gate, and smaller ones defended every angle of its walls. All were square. Drum towers and half-moons held up better against catapults, since thrown stones were more apt to deflect off a curved wall, but Raventree predated that particular bit of builder\u2019s wisdom.\nThe castle dominated the broad fertile valley that maps and men alike called Blackwood Vale. A vale it was, beyond a doubt, but no wood had grown here for several thousand years, be it black or brown or green. Once, yes, but axes had long since cleared the trees away. Homes and mills and holdfasts had risen where once the oaks stood tall. The ground was bare and muddy, and dotted here and there with drifts of melting snow.\nInside the castle walls, however, a bit of the forest still remained. House Blackwood kept the old gods, and worshiped as the First Men had in the days before the Andals came to Westeros. Some of the trees in their godswood were said to be as old as Raventree\u2019s square towers, especially the heart tree, a weirwood of colossal size whose upper branches could be seen from leagues away, like bony fingers scratching at the sky.\nAs Jaime Lannister and his escort wound through the rolling hills into the vale, little remained of the fields and farms and orchards that had once surrounded Raventree\u2014only mud and ashes, and here and there the blackened shells of homes and mills. Weeds and thorns and nettles grew in that wasteland, but nothing that could be called a crop. Everywhere Jaime looked he saw his father\u2019s hand, even in the bones they sometimes glimpsed beside the road. Most were sheep bones, but there were horses too, and cattle, and now and again a human skull, or a headless skeleton with weeds poking up through its rib cage.\nNo great hosts encircled Raventree, as Riverrun had been encircled. This siege was a more intimate affair, the latest step in a dance that went back many centuries. At best Jonos Bracken had five hundred men about the castle. Jaime saw no siege towers, no battering rams, no catapults. Bracken did not mean to break the gates of Raventree nor storm its high, thick walls. With no prospect of relief in sight, he was content to starve his rival out. No doubt there had been sorties and skirmishes at the start of the siege, and arrows flying back and forth; half a year into it, everyone was too tired for such nonsense. Boredom and routine had taken over, the enemies of discipline.\nPast time this was ended, thought Jaime Lannister. With Riverrun now safely in Lannister hands, Raventree was the remnant of the Young Wolf\u2019s short-lived kingdom. Once it yielded, his work along the Trident would be done, and he would be free to return to King\u2019s Landing. To the king, he told himself, but another part of him whispered, to Cersei.\nHe would have to face her, he supposed. Assuming the High Septon had not put her to death by the time he got back to the city. \u201cCome at once,\u201d she had written, in the letter he\u2019d had Peck burn at Riverrun. \u201cHelp me. Save me. I need you now as I have never needed you before. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come at once.\u201d Her need was real enough, Jaime did not doubt. As for the rest\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she\u2019s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know\u00a0\u2026 Even if he had gone back, he could not hope to save her. She was guilty of every treason laid against her, and he was short a sword hand.\nWhen the column came trotting from the fields, the sentries stared at them with more curiosity than fear. No one sounded the alarm, which suited Jaime well enough. Lord Bracken\u2019s pavilion did not prove difficult to find. It was the largest in the camp, and the best sited; sitting atop a low rise beside a stream, it commanded a clear view of two of Raventree\u2019s gates.\nThe tent was brown, like the standard flapping from its center pole, where the red stallion of House Bracken reared upon its gold escutcheon. Jaime gave the order to dismount and told his men that they might mingle if they liked. \u201cNot you two,\u201d he said to his banner-bearers. \u201cStay close. This will not keep me long.\u201d Jaime vaulted down off Honor and strode to Bracken\u2019s tent, his sword rattling in its scabbard.\nThe guards outside the tent flap exchanged an anxious look at his approach. \u201cMy lord,\u201d said one. \u201cShall we announce you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll announce myself.\u201d Jaime pushed aside the flap with his golden hand and ducked inside.\nThey were well and truly at it when he entered, so intent on their rutting that neither took any note of his arrival. The woman had her eyes closed. Her hands clutched the coarse brown hair on Bracken\u2019s back. She gasped every time he drove into her. His lordship\u2019s head was buried in her breasts, his hands locked around her hips. Jaime cleared his throat. \u201cLord Jonos.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s eyes flew open, and she gave a startled shriek. Jonos Bracken rolled off her, grabbed for his scabbard, and came up with naked steel in hand, cursing. \u201cSeven bloody hells,\u201d he started, \u201cwho dares\u2014\u201d Then he saw Jaime\u2019s white cloak and golden breastplate. His swordpoint dropped. \u201cLannister?\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry to disturb you at your pleasure, my lord,\u201d said Jaime, with a half-smile, \u201cbut I am in some haste. May we talk?\u201d\n\u201cTalk. Aye.\u201d Lord Jonos sheathed his sword. He was not quite so tall as Jaime, but he was heavier, with thick shoulders and arms that would have made a blacksmith envious. Brown stubble covered his cheeks and chin. His eyes were brown as well, the anger in them poorly hidden. \u201cYou took me unawares, my lord. I was not told of your coming.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I seem to have prevented yours.\u201d Jaime smiled at the woman in the bed. She had one hand over her left breast and the other between her legs, which left her right breast exposed. Her nipples were darker than Cersei\u2019s and thrice the size. When she felt Jaime\u2019s gaze she covered her right nipple, but that revealed her mound. \u201cAre all camp followers so modest?\u201d he wondered. \u201cIf a man wants to sell his turnips, he needs to set them out.\u201d\n\u201cYou been looking at my turnips since you came in, ser.\u201d The woman found the blanket and pulled it up high enough to cover herself to the waist, then raised one hand to push her hair back from her eyes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not for sale, neither.\u201d\nJaime gave a shrug. \u201cMy apologies if I mistook you for something you\u2019re not. My little brother has known a hundred whores, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019ve only ever bedded one.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a prize of war.\u201d Bracken retrieved his breeches from the floor and shook them out. \u201cShe belonged to one of Blackwood\u2019s sworn swords till I split his head in two. Put your hands down, woman. My lord of Lannister wants a proper look at those teats.\u201d\nJaime ignored that. \u201cYou are putting those breeches on backwards, my lord,\u201d he told Bracken. As Jonos cursed, the woman slipped off the bed to snatch up her scattered clothing, her fingers fluttering nervously between her breasts and cleft as she bent and turned and reached. Her efforts to conceal herself were oddly provocative, far more so than if she\u2019d simply gone about the business naked. \u201cDo you have a name, woman?\u201d he asked her.\n\u201cMy mother named me Hildy, ser.\u201d She pulled a soiled shift down over her head and shook her hair out. Her face was almost as dirty as her feet and she had enough hair between her legs to pass for Bracken\u2019s sister, but there was something appealing about her all the same. That pug nose, her shaggy mane of hair\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or the way she did a little curtsy after she had stepped into her skirt. \u201cHave you seen my other shoe, m\u2019lord?\u201d\nThe question seemed to vex Lord Bracken. \u201cAm I a bloody handmaid, to fetch you shoes? Go barefoot if you must. Just go.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean m\u2019lord won\u2019t be taking me home with him, to pray with his little wife?\u201d Laughing, Hildy gave Jaime a brazen look. \u201cDo you have a little wife, ser?\u201d\nNo, I have a sister. \u201cWhat color is my cloak?\u201d\n\u201cWhite,\u201d she said, \u201cbut your hand is solid gold. I like that in a man. And what is it you like in a woman, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cInnocence.\u201d\n\u201cIn a woman, I said. Not a daughter.\u201d\nHe thought of Myrcella. I will need to tell her too. The Dornishmen might not like that. Doran Martell had betrothed her to his son in the belief that she was Robert\u2019s blood. Knots and tangles, Jaime thought, wishing he could cut through all of it with one swift stroke of his sword. \u201cI have sworn a vow,\u201d he told Hildy wearily.\n\u201cNo turnips for you, then,\u201d the girl said, saucily.\n\u201cGet out,\u201d Lord Jonos roared at her.\nShe did. But as she slipped past Jaime, clutching one shoe and a pile of her clothes, she reached down and gave his cock a squeeze through his breeches. \u201cHildy,\u201d she reminded him, before she darted half-clothed from the tent.\nHildy, Jaime mused. \u201cAnd how fares your lady wife?\u201d he asked Lord Jonos when the girl was gone.\n\u201cHow would I know? Ask her septon. When your father burned our castle, she decided the gods were punishing us. Now all she does is pray.\u201d Jonos had finally gotten his breeches turned the right way round and was lacing them up the front. \u201cWhat brings you here, my lord? The Blackfish? We heard how he escaped.\u201d\n\u201cDid you?\u201d Jaime settled on a camp stool. \u201cFrom the man himself, perchance?\u201d\n\u201cSer Brynden knows better than to come running to me. I am fond of the man, I won\u2019t deny that. That won\u2019t stop me clapping him in chains if he shows his face near me or mine. He knows I\u2019ve bent the knee. He should have done the same, but he always was a stubborn one. His brother could have told you that.\u201d\n\u201cTytos Blackwood has not bent the knee,\u201d Jaime pointed out. \u201cMight the Blackfish seek refuge at Raventree?\u201d\n\u201cHe might seek it, but to find it he\u2019d need to get past my siege lines, and last I heard he hadn\u2019t grown wings. Tytos will be needing refuge himself before much longer. They\u2019re down to rats and roots in there. He\u2019ll yield before the next full moon.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll yield before the sun goes down. I mean to offer him terms and accept him back into the king\u2019s peace.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Lord Jonos shrugged into a brown woolen tunic with the red stallion of Bracken embroidered on the front. \u201cWill my lord take a horn of ale?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but don\u2019t go dry on my account.\u201d\nBracken filled a horn for himself, drank half of it, and wiped his mouth. \u201cYou spoke of terms. What sort of terms?\u201d\n\u201cThe usual sort. Lord Blackwood shall be required to confess his treason and abjure his allegiance to the Starks and Tullys. He will swear solemnly before gods and men to henceforth remain a leal vassal of Harrenhal and the Iron Throne, and I will give him pardon in the king\u2019s name. We will take a pot or two of gold, of course. The price of rebellion. I\u2019ll claim a hostage as well, to ensure that Raventree does not rise again.\u201d\n\u201cHis daughter,\u201d suggested Bracken. \u201cBlackwood has six sons, but only the one daughter. He dotes on her. A snot-nosed little creature, couldn\u2019t be more than seven.\u201d\n\u201cYoung, but she might serve.\u201d\nLord Jonos drained the last of his ale and tossed the horn aside. \u201cWhat of the lands and castles we were promised?\u201d\n\u201cWhat lands were these?\u201d\n\u201cThe east bank of the Widow\u2019s Wash, from Crossbow Ridge to Rutting Meadow, and all the islands in the stream. Grindcorn Mill and Lord\u2019s Mill, the ruins of Muddy Hall, the Ravishment, Battle Valley, Oldforge, the villages of Buckle, Blackbuckle, Cairns, and Claypool, and the market town at Mudgrave. Waspwood, Lorgen\u2019s Wood, Greenhill, and Barba\u2019s Teats. Missy\u2019s Teats, the Blackwoods call them, but they were Barba\u2019s first. Honeytree and all the hives. Here, I\u2019ve marked them out if my lord would like a look.\u201d He rooted about on a table and produced a parchment map.\nJaime took it with his good hand, but he had to use the gold to open it and hold it flat. \u201cThis is a deal of land,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou will be increasing your domains by a quarter.\u201d\nBracken\u2019s mouth set stubbornly. \u201cAll these lands belonged to Stone Hedge once. The Blackwoods stole them from us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about this village here, between the Teats?\u201d Jaime tapped the map with a gilded knuckle.\n\u201cPennytree. That was ours once too, but it\u2019s been a royal fief for a hundred years. Leave that out. We ask only for the lands stolen by the Blackwoods. Your lord father promised to restore them to us if we would subdue Lord Tytos for him.\u201d\n\u201cYet as I was riding up, I saw Tully banners flying from the castle walls, and the direwolf of Stark as well. That would seem to suggest that Lord Tytos has not been subdued.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve driven him and his from the field and penned them up inside Raventree. Give me sufficient men to storm his walls, my lord, and I will subdue the whole lot of them to their graves.\u201d\n\u201cIf I gave you sufficient men, they would be doing the subduing, not you. In which case I should reward myself.\u201d Jaime let the map roll up again. \u201cI\u2019ll keep this if I might.\u201d\n\u201cThe map is yours. The lands are ours. It\u2019s said that a Lannister always pays his debts. We fought for you.\u201d\n\u201cNot half as long as you fought against us.\u201d\n\u201cThe king has pardoned us for that. I lost my nephew to your swords, and my natural son. Your Mountain stole my harvest and burned everything he could not carry off. He put my castle to the torch and raped one of my daughters. I will have recompense.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mountain\u2019s dead, as is my father,\u201d Jaime told him, \u201cand some might say your head was recompense enough. You did declare for Stark, and kept faith with him until Lord Walder killed him.\u201d\n\u201cMurdered him, and a dozen good men of my own blood.\u201d Lord Jonos turned his head and spat. \u201cAye, I kept faith with the Young Wolf. As I\u2019ll keep faith with you, so long as you treat me fair. I bent the knee because I saw no sense in dying for the dead nor shedding Bracken blood in a lost cause.\u201d\n\u201cA prudent man.\u201d Though some might say that Lord Blackwood has been more honorable. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your lands. Some of them, at least. Since you partly subdued the Blackwoods.\u201d\nThat seemed to satisfy Lord Jonos. \u201cWe will be content with whatever portion my lord thinks fair. If I may offer you some counsel, though, it does not serve to be too gentle with these Blackwoods. Treachery runs in their blood. Before the Andals came to Westeros, House Bracken ruled this river. We were kings and the Blackwoods were our vassals, but they betrayed us and usurped the crown. Every Blackwood is born a turncloak. You would do well to remember that when you are making terms.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I shall,\u201d Jaime promised.\nWhen he rode from Bracken\u2019s siege camp to the gates of Raventree, Peck went before him with a peace banner. Before they reached the castle, twenty pairs of eyes were watching them from the gatehouse ramparts. He drew Honor to a halt at the edge of the moat, a deep trench lined with stone, its green waters choked by scum. Jaime was about to command Ser Kennos to sound the Horn of Herrock when the drawbridge began to descend.\nLord Tytos Blackwood met him in the outer ward, mounted on a destrier as gaunt as himself. Very tall and very thin, the Lord of Raventree had a hook nose, long hair, and a ragged salt-and-pepper beard that showed more salt than pepper. In silver inlay on the breastplate of his burnished scarlet armor was a white tree bare and dead, surrounded by a flock of onyx ravens taking flight. A cloak of raven feathers fluttered from his shoulders.\n\u201cLord Tytos,\u201d Jaime said.\n\u201cSer.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for allowing me to enter.\u201d\n\u201cI will not say that you are welcome. Nor will I deny that I have hoped that you might come. You are here for my sword.\u201d\n\u201cI am here to make an end of this. Your men have fought valiantly, but your war is lost. Are you prepared to yield?\u201d\n\u201cTo the king. Not to Jonos Bracken.\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\nBlackwood hesitated a moment. \u201cIs it your wish that I dismount and kneel before you here and now?\u201d\nA hundred eyes were looking on. \u201cThe wind is cold and the yard is muddy,\u201d said Jaime. \u201cYou can do your kneeling on the carpet in your solar once we\u2019ve agreed on terms.\u201d\n\u201cThat is chivalrous of you,\u201d said Lord Tytos. \u201cCome, ser. My hall might lack for food, but never for courtesy.\u201d\nBlackwood\u2019s solar was on the second floor of a cavernous timber keep. There was a fire burning in the hearth when they entered. The room was large and airy, with great beams of dark oak supporting the high ceiling. Woolen tapestries covered the walls, and a pair of wide latticework doors looked out upon the godswood. Through their thick, diamond-shaped panes of yellow glass Jaime glimpsed the gnarled limbs of the tree from which the castle took its name. It was a weirwood ancient and colossal, ten times the size of the one in the Stone Garden at Casterly Rock. This tree was bare and dead, though.\n\u201cThe Brackens poisoned it,\u201d said his host. \u201cFor a thousand years it has not shown a leaf. In another thousand it will have turned to stone, the maesters say. Weirwoods never rot.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the ravens?\u201d asked Jaime. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\u201cThey come at dusk and roost all night. Hundreds of them. They cover the tree like black leaves, every limb and every branch. They have been coming for thousands of years. How or why, no man can say, yet the tree draws them every night.\u201d Blackwood settled in a high-backed chair. \u201cFor honor\u2019s sake I must ask about my liege lord.\u201d\n\u201cSer Edmure is on his way to Casterly Rock as my captive. His wife will remain at the Twins until their child is born. Then she and the babe will join him. So long as he does not attempt escape or plot rebellion, Edmure will live a long life.\u201d\n\u201cLong and bitter. A life without honor. Until his dying day, men will say he was afraid to fight.\u201d\nUnjustly, Jaime thought. It was his child he feared for. He knew whose son I am, better than mine own aunt. \u201cThe choice was his. His uncle would have made us bleed.\u201d\n\u201cWe agree on that much.\u201d Blackwood\u2019s voice gave nothing away. \u201cWhat have you done with Ser Brynden, if I may ask?\u201d\n\u201cI offered to let him take the black. Instead he fled.\u201d Jaime smiled. \u201cDo you have him here, perchance?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWould you tell me if you did?\u201d\nIt was Tytos Blackwood\u2019s turn to smile.\nJaime brought his hands together, the gold fingers inside the fleshy ones. \u201cPerhaps it is time we talked of terms.\u201d\n\u201cIs this where I get down on my knees?\u201d\n\u201cIf it please you. Or we can say you did.\u201d\nLord Blackwood remained seated. They soon reached agreement on the major points: confession, fealty, pardon, a certain sum of gold and silver to be paid. \u201cWhat lands will you require?\u201d Lord Tytos asked. When Jaime handed him the map, he took one look and chuckled. \u201cTo be sure. The turncloak must be given his reward.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but a smaller one than he imagines, for a smaller service. Which of these lands will you consent to part with?\u201d\nLord Tytos considered for a moment. \u201cWoodhedge, Crossbow Ridge, and Buckle.\u201d\n\u201cA ruin, a ridge, and a few hovels? Come, my lord. You must suffer for your treason. He will want one of the mills, at least.\u201d Mills were a valuable source of tax. The lord received a tenth of all the grain they ground.\n\u201cLord\u2019s Mill, then. Grindcorn is ours.\u201d\n\u201cAnd another village. Cairns?\u201d\n\u201cI have forebears buried beneath the rocks of Cairns.\u201d He looked at the map again. \u201cGive him Honeytree and its hives. All that sweet will make him fat and rot his teeth.\u201d\n\u201cDone, then. But for one last thing.\u201d\n\u201cA hostage.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord. You have a daughter, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cBethany.\u201d Lord Tytos looked stricken. \u201cI also have two brothers and a sister. A pair of widowed aunts. Nieces, nephews, cousins. I had thought you might consent\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt must be a child of your blood.\u201d\n\u201cBethany is only eight. A gentle girl, full of laughter. She has never been more than a day\u2019s ride from my hall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not let her see King\u2019s Landing? His Grace is almost of an age with her. He would be pleased to have another friend.\u201d\n\u201cOne he can hang if the friend\u2019s father should displease him?\u201d asked Lord Tytos. \u201cI have four sons. Would you consider one of them instead? Ben is twelve and thirsty for adventure. He could squire for you if it please my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI have more squires than I know what to do with. Every time I take a piss, they fight for the right to hold my cock. And you have six sons, my lord, not four.\u201d\n\u201cOnce. Robert was my youngest and never strong. He died nine days ago, of a looseness of the bowels. Lucas was murdered at the Red Wedding. Walder Frey\u2019s fourth wife was a Blackwood, but kinship counts for no more than guest right at the Twins. I should like to bury Lucas beneath the tree, but the Freys have not yet seen fit to return his bones to me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that they do. Was Lucas your eldest son?\u201d\n\u201cMy second. Brynden is my eldest, and my heir. Next comes Hoster. A bookish boy, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cThey have books in King\u2019s Landing too. I recall my little brother reading them from time to time. Perhaps your son would like a look at them. I will accept Hoster as our hostage.\u201d\nBlackwood\u2019s relief was palpable. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d He hesitated a moment. \u201cIf I may be so bold, you would do well to require a hostage from Lord Jonos too. One of his daughters. For all his rutting, he has not proved man enough to father sons.\u201d\n\u201cHe had a bastard son killed in the war.\u201d\n\u201cDid he? Harry was a bastard, true enough, but whether Jonos sired him is a thornier question. A fair-haired boy, he was, and comely. Jonos is neither.\u201d Lord Tytos got to his feet. \u201cWill you do me the honor of taking supper with me?\u201d\n\u201cSome other time, my lord.\u201d The castle was starving; no good would be served by Jaime stealing food from their mouths. \u201cI cannot linger. Riverrun awaits.\u201d\n\u201cRiverrun? Or King\u2019s Landing?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\nLord Tytos did not attempt to dissuade him. \u201cHoster can be ready to depart within the hour.\u201d\nHe was. The boy met Jaime by the stables, with a bedroll slung over one shoulder and a bundle of scrolls beneath his arm. He could not have been any older than sixteen, yet he was even taller than his father, almost seven feet of legs and shins and elbows, a gangling, gawky boy with a cowlick. \u201cLord Commander. I\u2019m your hostage, Hoster. Hos, they call me.\u201d He grinned.\nDoes he think this is a lark? \u201cPray, who are they?\u201d\n\u201cMy friends. My brothers.\u201d\n\u201cI am not your friend and I am not your brother.\u201d That cleaned the grin off the boy\u2019s face. Jaime turned to Lord Tytos. \u201cMy lord, let there be no misunderstanding here. Lord Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, Sandor Clegane, Brynden Tully, this woman Stoneheart\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all these are outlaws and rebels, enemies to the king and all his leal subjects. If I should learn that you or yours are hiding them, protecting them, or assisting them in any way, I will not hesitate to send you your son\u2019s head. I hope you understand that. Understand this as well: I am not Ryman Frey.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d All trace of warmth had left Lord Blackwood\u2019s mouth. \u201cI know who I am dealing with. Kingslayer.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Jaime mounted and wheeled Honor toward the gate. \u201cI wish you a good harvest and the joy of the king\u2019s peace.\u201d\nHe did not ride far. Lord Jonos Bracken was waiting for him outside Raventree, just beyond the range of a good crossbow. He was mounted on an armored destrier and had donned his plate and mail, and a grey steel greathelm with a horsehair crest. \u201cI saw them pull the direwolf banner down,\u201d he said when Jaime reached him. \u201cIs it done?\u201d\n\u201cDone and done. Go home and plant your fields.\u201d\nLord Bracken raised his visor. \u201cI trust I have more fields to plant than when you went into that castle.\u201d\n\u201cBuckle, Woodhedge, Honeytree and all its hives.\u201d He was forgetting one. \u201cOh, and Crossbow Ridge.\u201d\n\u201cA mill,\u201d said Bracken. \u201cI must have a mill.\u201d\n\u201cLord\u2019s Mill.\u201d\nLord Jonos snorted. \u201cAye, that will serve. For now.\u201d He pointed at Hoster Blackwood, riding back with Peck. \u201cIs this what he gave you for a hostage? You were cozened, ser. A weakling, this one. Water for blood. Never mind how tall he is, any one of my girls could snap him like a rotten twig.\u201d\n\u201cHow many daughters do you have, my lord?\u201d Jaime asked him.\n\u201cFive. Two by my first wife and three by my third.\u201d Too late, he seemed to realize that he might have said too much.\n\u201cSend one of them to court. She will have the privilege of attending the Queen Regent.\u201d\nBracken\u2019s face grew dark as he realized the import of those words. \u201cIs this how you repay the friendship of Stone Hedge?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a great honor to wait upon the queen,\u201d Jaime reminded his lordship. \u201cYou might want to impress that on her. We\u2019ll look for the girl before the year is out.\u201d He did not wait for Lord Bracken to reply but touched Honor lightly with his golden spurs and trotted off. His men formed up and followed, banners streaming. Castle and camp were soon lost behind them, obscured by the dust of their hooves.\nNeither outlaws nor wolves had troubled them on their way to Raventree, so Jaime decided to return by a different route. If the gods were good, he might stumble on the Blackfish, or lure Beric Dondarrion into an unwise attack.\nThey were following the Widow\u2019s Wash when they ran out of day. Jaime called his hostage forward and asked him where to find the nearest ford, and the boy led them there. As the column splashed across the shallow waters, the sun was setting behind a pair of grassy hills. \u201cThe Teats,\u201d said Hoster Blackwood.\nJaime recalled Lord Bracken\u2019s map. \u201cThere\u2019s a village between those hills.\u201d\n\u201cPennytree,\u201d the lad confirmed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll camp there for the night.\u201d If there were villagers about, they might have knowledge of Ser Brynden or the outlaws. \u201cLord Jonos made some remark about whose teats they were,\u201d he recalled to the Blackwood boy as they rode toward the darkening hills and the last light of the day. \u201cThe Brackens call them by one name and the Blackwoods by another.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lord. For a hundred years or so. Before that, they were the Mother\u2019s Teats, or just the Teats. There are two of them, and it was thought that they resembled\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can see what they resemble.\u201d Jaime found himself thinking back on the woman in the tent and the way she\u2019d tried to hide her large, dark nipples. \u201cWhat changed a hundred years ago?\u201d\n\u201cAegon the Unworthy took Barba Bracken as his mistress,\u201d the bookish boy replied. \u201cShe was a very buxom wench, they say, and one day when the king was visiting at the Stone Hedge he went out hunting and saw the Teats and\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0named them for his mistress.\u201d Aegon the Fourth had died long before Jaime had been born, but he recalled enough of the history of his reign to guess what must have happened next. \u201cOnly later he put the Bracken girl aside and took up with a Blackwood, was that the way of it?\u201d\n\u201cLady Melissa,\u201d Hoster confirmed. \u201cMissy, they called her. There\u2019s a statue of her in our godswood. She was much more beautiful than Barba Bracken, but slender, and Barba was heard to say that Missy was flat as a boy. When King Aegon heard, he\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0gave her Barba\u2019s teats.\u201d Jaime laughed. \u201cHow did all this begin, between Blackwood and Bracken? Is it written down?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, my lord,\u201d the boy said, \u201cbut some of the histories were penned by their maesters and some by ours, centuries after the events that they purport to chronicle. It goes back to the Age of Heroes. The Blackwoods were kings in those days. The Brackens were petty lords, renowned for breeding horses. Rather than pay their king his just due, they used the gold their horses brought them to hire swords and cast him down.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did all this happen?\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred years before the Andals. A thousand, if the True History is to be believed. Only no one knows when the Andals crossed the narrow sea. The True History says four thousand years have passed since then, but some maesters claim that it was only two. Past a certain point, all the dates grow hazy and confused, and the clarity of history becomes the fog of legend.\u201d\nTyrion would like this one. They could talk from dusk to dawn, arguing about books. For a moment his bitterness toward his brother was forgotten, until he remembered what the Imp had done. \u201cSo you are fighting over a crown that one of you took from the other back when the Casterlys still held Casterly Rock, is that the root of it? The crown of a kingdom that has not existed for thousands of years?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSo many years, so many wars, so many kings\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you\u2019d think someone would have made a peace.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone did, my lord. Many someones. We\u2019ve had a hundred peaces with the Brackens, many sealed with marriages. There\u2019s Blackwood blood in every Bracken, and Bracken blood in every Blackwood. The Old King\u2019s Peace lasted half a century. But then some fresh quarrel broke out, and the old wounds opened and began to bleed again. That\u2019s how it always happens, my father says. So long as men remember the wrongs done to their forebears, no peace will ever last. So we go on century after century, with us hating the Brackens and them hating us. My father says there will never be an end to it.\u201d\n\u201cThere could be.\u201d\n\u201cHow, my lord? The old wounds never heal, my father says.\u201d\n\u201cMy father had a saying too. Never wound a foe when you can kill him. Dead men don\u2019t claim vengeance.\u201d\n\u201cTheir sons do,\u201d said Hoster, apologetically.\n\u201cNot if you kill the sons as well. Ask the Casterlys about that if you doubt me. Ask Lord and Lady Tarbeck, or the Reynes of Castamere. Ask the Prince of Dragonstone.\u201d For an instant, the deep red clouds that crowned the western hills reminded him of Rhaegar\u2019s children, all wrapped up in crimson cloaks.\n\u201cIs that why you killed all the Starks?\u201d\n\u201cNot all,\u201d said Jaime. \u201cLord Eddard\u2019s daughters live. One has just been wed. The other\u00a0\u2026\u201d Brienne, where are you? Have you found her? \u201c\u2026\u00a0if the gods are good, she\u2019ll forget she was a Stark. She\u2019ll wed some burly blacksmith or fat-faced innkeep, fill his house with children, and never need to fear that some knight might come along to smash their heads against a wall.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods are good,\u201d his hostage said, uncertainly.\nYou go on believing that. Jaime let Honor feel his spurs.\nPennytree proved to be a much larger village than he had anticipated. The war had been here too; blackened orchards and the scorched shells of broken houses testified to that. But for every home in ruins three more had been rebuilt. Through the gathering blue dusk Jaime glimpsed fresh thatch upon a score of roofs, and doors made of raw green wood. Between a duck pond and a blacksmith\u2019s forge, he came upon the tree that gave the place its name, an oak ancient and tall. Its gnarled roots twisted in and out of the earth like a nest of slow brown serpents, and hundreds of old copper pennies had been nailed to its huge trunk.\nPeck stared at the tree, then at the empty houses. \u201cWhere are the people?\u201d\n\u201cHiding,\u201d Jaime told him.\nInside the homes all the fires had been put out, but some still smoked, and none of them were cold. The nanny goat that Hot Harry Merrell found rooting through a vegetable garden was the only living creature to be seen\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the village had a holdfast as strong as any in the riverlands, with thick stone walls twelve feet high, and Jaime knew that was where he\u2019d find the villagers. They hid behind those walls when raiders came, that\u2019s why there\u2019s still a village here. And they are hiding there again, from me.\nHe rode Honor up to the holdfast gates. \u201cYou in the holdfast. We mean you no harm. We\u2019re king\u2019s men.\u201d\nFaces appeared on the wall above the gate. \u201cThey was king\u2019s men burned our village,\u201d one man called down. \u201cBefore that, some other king\u2019s men took our sheep. They were for a different king, but that didn\u2019t matter none to our sheep. King\u2019s men killed Harsley and Ser Ormond, and raped Lacey till she died.\u201d\n\u201cNot my men,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cWill you open your gates?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re gone we will.\u201d\nSer Kennos rode close to him. \u201cWe could break that gate down easy enough, or put it to the torch.\u201d\n\u201cWhile they drop stones on us and feather us with arrows.\u201d Jaime shook his head. \u201cIt would be a bloody business, and for what? These people have done us no harm. We\u2019ll shelter in the houses, but I\u2019ll have no stealing. We have our own provisions.\u201d\nAs a half-moon crept up the sky, they staked their horses out in the village commons and supped on salted mutton, dried apples, and hard cheese. Jaime ate sparingly and shared a skin of wine with Peck and Hos the hostage. He tried to count the pennies nailed to the old oak, but there were too many of them and he kept losing count. What\u2019s that all about? The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked, but that would spoil the mystery.\nHe posted sentries to see that no one left the confines of the village. He sent out scouts as well, to make certain no enemy took them unawares. It was near midnight when two came riding back with a woman they had taken captive. \u201cShe rode up bold as you please, m\u2019lord, demanding words with you.\u201d\nJaime scrambled to his feet. \u201cMy lady. I had not thought to see you again so soon.\u201d Gods be good, she looks ten years older than when I saw her last. And what\u2019s happened to her face? \u201cThat bandage\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you\u2019ve been wounded\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA bite.\u201d She touched the hilt of her sword, the sword that he had given her. Oathkeeper. \u201cMy lord, you gave me a quest.\u201d\n\u201cThe girl. Have you found her?\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Brienne, Maid of Tarth.\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\u201cA day\u2019s ride. I can take you to her, ser\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but you will need to come alone. Elsewise, the Hound will kill her.\u201d",

      "content": "JON\nR\u2019hllor,\u201d sang Melisandre, her arms upraised against the falling snow, \u201cyou are the light in our eyes, the fire in our hearts, the heat in our loins. Yours is the sun that warms our days, yours the stars that guard us in the dark of night.\u201d\n\u201cAll praise R\u2019hllor, the Lord of Light,\u201d the wedding guests answered in ragged chorus before a gust of ice-cold wind blew their words away. Jon Snow raised the hood of his cloak.\nThe snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing from the east along the Wall, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan used to tell. Even Melisandre\u2019s fire was shivering; the flames huddled down in the ditch, crackling softly as the red priestess sang. Only Ghost seemed not to feel the chill.\nAlys Karstark leaned close to Jon. \u201cSnow during a wedding means a cold marriage. My lady mother always said so.\u201d\nHe glanced at Queen Selyse. There must have been a blizzard the day she and Stannis wed. Huddled beneath her ermine mantle and surrounded by her ladies, serving girls, and knights, the southron queen seemed a frail, pale, shrunken thing. A strained smile was frozen into place on her thin lips, but her eyes brimmed with reverence. She hates the cold but loves the flames. He had only to look at her to see that. A word from Melisandre, and she would walk into the fire willingly, embrace it like a lover.\nNot all her queen\u2019s men seemed to share her fervor. Ser Brus appeared half-drunk, Ser Malegorn\u2019s gloved hand was cupped round the arse of the lady beside him, Ser Narbert was yawning, and Ser Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain looked angry. Jon Snow had begun to understand why Stannis had left them with his queen.\n\u201cThe night is dark and filled with terrors,\u201d Melisandre sang. \u201cAlone we are born and alone we die, but as we walk through this black vale we draw strength from one another, and from you, our lord.\u201d Her scarlet silks and satins swirled with every gust of wind. \u201cTwo come forth today to join their lives, so they may face this world\u2019s darkness together. Fill their hearts with fire, my lord, so they may walk your shining path hand in hand forever.\u201d\n\u201cLord of Light, protect us,\u201d cried Queen Selyse. Other voices echoed the response. Melisandre\u2019s faithful: pallid ladies, shivering serving girls, Ser Axell and Ser Narbert and Ser Lambert, men-at-arms in iron mail and Thenns in bronze, even a few of Jon\u2019s black brothers. \u201cLord of Light, bless your children.\u201d\nMelisandre\u2019s back was to the Wall, on one side of the deep ditch where her fire burned. The couple to be joined faced her across the ditch. Behind them stood the queen, with her daughter and her tattooed fool. Princess Shireen was wrapped in so many furs that she looked round, breathing in white puffs through the scarf that covered most of her face. Ser Axell Florent and his queen\u2019s men surrounded the royal party.\nThough only a few men of the Night\u2019s Watch had gathered about the ditchfire, more looked down from rooftops and windows and the steps of the great switchback stair. Jon took careful note of who was there and who was not. Some men had the duty; many just off watch were fast asleep. But others had chosen to absent themselves to show their disapproval. Othell Yarwyck and Bowen Marsh were amongst the missing. Septon Chayle had emerged briefly from the sept, fingering the seven-sided crystal on the thong about his neck, only to retreat inside again once the prayers began.\nMelisandre raised her hands, and the ditchfire leapt upward toward her fingers, like a great red dog springing for a treat. A swirl of sparks rose to meet the snowflakes coming down. \u201cOh, Lord of Light, we thank you,\u201d she sang to the hungry flames. \u201cWe thank you for brave Stannis, by your grace our king. Guide him and defend him, R\u2019hllor. Protect him from the treacheries of evil men and grant him strength to smite the servants of the dark.\u201d\n\u201cGrant him strength,\u201d answered Queen Selyse and her knights and ladies. \u201cGrant him courage. Grant him wisdom.\u201d\nAlys Karstark slipped her arm through Jon\u2019s. \u201cHow much longer, Lord Snow? If I\u2019m to be buried beneath this snow, I\u2019d like to die a woman wed.\u201d\n\u201cSoon, my lady,\u201d Jon assured her. \u201cSoon.\u201d\n\u201cWe thank you for the sun that warms us,\u201d chanted the queen. \u201cWe thank you for the stars that watch over us in the black of night. We thank you for our hearths and for our torches that keep the savage dark at bay. We thank you for our bright spirits, the fires in our loins and in our hearts.\u201d\nAnd Melisandre said, \u201cLet them come forth, who would be joined.\u201d The flames cast her shadow on the Wall behind her, and her ruby gleamed against the paleness of her throat.\nJon turned to Alys Karstark. \u201cMy lady. Are you ready?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Oh, yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not scared?\u201d\nThe girl smiled in a way that reminded Jon so much of his little sister that it almost broke his heart. \u201cLet him be scared of me.\u201d The snowflakes were melting on her cheeks, but her hair was wrapped in a swirl of lace that Satin had found somewhere, and the snow had begun to collect there, giving her a frosty crown. Her cheeks were flushed and red, and her eyes sparkled.\n\u201cWinter\u2019s lady.\u201d Jon squeezed her hand.\nThe Magnar of Thenn stood waiting by the fire, clad as if for battle, in fur and leather and bronze scales, a bronze sword at his hip. His receding hair made him look older than his years, but as he turned to watch his bride approach, Jon could see the boy in him. His eyes were big as walnuts, though whether it was the fire, the priestess, or the woman that had put the fear in him Jon could not say. Alys was more right than she knew.\n\u201cWho brings this woman to be wed?\u201d asked Melisandre.\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Jon. \u201cNow comes Alys of House Karstark, a woman grown and flowered, of noble blood and birth.\u201d He gave her hand one last squeeze and stepped back to join the others.\n\u201cWho comes forth to claim this woman?\u201d asked Melisandre.\n\u201cMe.\u201d Sigorn slapped his chest. \u201cMagnar of Thenn.\u201d\n\u201cSigorn,\u201d asked Melisandre, \u201cwill you share your fire with Alys, and warm her when the night is dark and full of terrors?\u201d\n\u201cI swear me.\u201d The Magnar\u2019s promise was a white cloud in the air. Snow dappled his shoulders. His ears were red. \u201cBy the red god\u2019s flames, I warm her all her days.\u201d\n\u201cAlys, do you swear to share your fire with Sigorn, and warm him when the night is dark and full of terrors?\u201d\n\u201cTill his blood is boiling.\u201d Her maiden\u2019s cloak was the black wool of the Night\u2019s Watch. The Karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it.\nMelisandre\u2019s eyes shone as bright as the ruby at her throat. \u201cThen come to me and be as one.\u201d As she beckoned, a wall of flames roared upward, licking at the snowflakes with hot orange tongues. Alys Karstark took her Magnar by the hand.\nSide by side they leapt the ditch.\n\u201cTwo went into the flames.\u201d A gust of wind lifted the red woman\u2019s scarlet skirts till she pressed them down again. \u201cOne emerges.\u201d Her coppery hair danced about her head. \u201cWhat fire joins, none may put asunder.\u201d\n\u201cWhat fire joins, none may put asunder,\u201d came the echo, from queen\u2019s men and Thenns and even a few of the black brothers.\nExcept for kings and uncles, thought Jon Snow.\nCregan Karstark had turned up a day behind his niece. With him came four mounted men-at-arms, a huntsman, and a pack of dogs, sniffing after Lady Alys as if she were a deer. Jon Snow met them on the kingsroad half a league south of Mole\u2019s Town, before they could turn up at Castle Black, claim guest right, or call for parley. One of Karstark\u2019s men had loosed a crossbow quarrel at Ty and died for it. That left four, and Cregan himself.\nFortunately they had a dozen ice cells. Room for all.\nLike so much else, heraldry ended at the Wall. The Thenns had no family arms as was customary amongst the nobles of the Seven Kingdoms, so Jon told the stewards to improvise. He thought they had done well. The bride\u2019s cloak Sigorn fastened about Lady Alys\u2019s shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk. The echo of the Karstark sunburst was there for those who cared to look, but differenced to make the arms appropriate for House Thenn.\nThe Magnar all but ripped the maiden\u2019s cloak from Alys\u2019s shoulders, but when he fastened her bride\u2019s cloak about her he was almost tender. As he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their breath mingled. The flames roared once again. The queen\u2019s men began to sing a song of praise. \u201cIs it done?\u201d Jon heard Satin whisper.\n\u201cDone and done,\u201d muttered Mully, \u201cand a good thing. They\u2019re wed and I\u2019m half-froze.\u201d He was muffled up in his best blacks, woolens so new that they had hardly had a chance to fade yet, but the wind had turned his cheeks as red as his hair. \u201cHobb\u2019s mulled some wine with cinnamon and cloves. That\u2019ll warm us some.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cloves?\u201d asked Owen the Oaf.\nThe snow had started to descend more heavily and the fire in the ditch was guttering out. The crowd began to break apart and stream from the yard, queen\u2019s men, king\u2019s men, and free folk alike, all anxious to get out of the wind and the cold. \u201cWill my lord be feasting with us?\u201d Mully asked Jon Snow.\n\u201cShortly.\u201d Sigorn might take it as a slight if he did not appear. And this marriage is mine own work, after all. \u201cI have other matters to attend to first, however.\u201d\nJon crossed to Queen Selyse, with Ghost beside him. His boots crunched through piles of old snow. It was growing ever more time-consuming to shovel out the paths from one building to another; more and more, the men were resorting to the underground passages they called wormways.\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0such a beautiful rite,\u201d the queen was saying. \u201cI could feel our lord\u2019s fiery gaze upon us. Oh, you cannot know how many times I have begged Stannis to let us be wed again, a true joining of body and spirit blessed by the Lord of Light. I know that I could give His Grace more children if we were bound in fire.\u201d\nTo give him more children you would first need to get him into your bed. Even at the Wall, it was common knowledge that Stannis Baratheon had shunned his wife for years. One could only imagine how His Grace had responded to the notion of a second wedding in the midst of his war.\nJon bowed. \u201cIf it please Your Grace, the feast awaits.\u201d\nThe queen glanced at Ghost suspiciously, then raised her head to Jon. \u201cTo be sure. Lady Melisandre knows the way.\u201d\nThe red priestess spoke up. \u201cI must attend my fires, Your Grace. Perhaps R\u2019hllor will vouchsafe me a glimpse of His Grace. A glimpse of some great victory, mayhaps.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Queen Selyse looked stricken. \u201cTo be sure\u00a0\u2026\u00a0let us pray for a vision from our lord\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSatin, show Her Grace to her place,\u201d said Jon.\nSer Malegorn stepped forward. \u201cI will escort Her Grace to the feast. We shall not require your\u00a0\u2026\u00a0steward.\u201d The way the man drew out the last word told Jon that he had been considering saying something else. Boy? Pet? Whore?\nJon bowed again. \u201cAs you wish. I shall join you shortly.\u201d\nSer Malegorn offered his arm, and Queen Selyse took it stiffly. Her other hand settled on her daughter\u2019s shoulder. The royal ducklings fell in behind them as they made their way across the yard, marching to the music of the bells on the fool\u2019s hat. \u201cUnder the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup, and all the serving men are crabs,\u201d Patchface proclaimed as they went. \u201cI know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nMelisandre\u2019s face darkened. \u201cThat creature is dangerous. Many a time I have glimpsed him in my flames. Sometimes there are skulls about him, and his lips are red with blood.\u201d\nA wonder you haven\u2019t had the poor man burned. All it would take was a word in the queen\u2019s ear, and Patchface would feed her fires. \u201cYou see fools in your fire, but no hint of Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I search for him all I see is snow.\u201d\nThe same useless answer. Clydas had dispatched a raven to Deepwood Motte to warn the king of Arnolf Karstark\u2019s treachery, but whether the bird had reached His Grace in time Jon did not know. The Braavosi banker was off in search of Stannis as well, accompanied by the guides that Jon had given him, but between the war and weather, it would be a wonder if he found him. \u201cWould you know if the king was dead?\u201d Jon asked the red priestess.\n\u201cHe is not dead. Stannis is the Lord\u2019s chosen, destined to lead the fight against the dark. I have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt.\u201d\nJon had heard all this before. \u201cStannis Baratheon was the Lord of Dragonstone, but he was not born there. He was born at Storm\u2019s End, like his brothers.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAnd what of Mance? Is he lost as well? What do your fires show?\u201d\n\u201cThe same, I fear. Only snow.\u201d\nSnow. It was snowing heavily to the south, Jon knew. Only two days\u2019 ride from here, the kingsroad was said to be impassable. Melisandre knows that too. And to the east, a savage storm was raging on the Bay of Seals. At last report, the ragtag fleet they had assembled to rescue the free folk from Hardhome still huddled at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, confined to port by the rough seas. \u201cYou are seeing cinders dancing in the updraft.\u201d\n\u201cI am seeing skulls. And you. I see your face every time I look into the flames. The danger that I warned you of grows very close now.\u201d\n\u201cDaggers in the dark. I know. You will forgive my doubts, my lady. A grey girl on a dying horse, fleeing from a marriage, that was what you said.\u201d\n\u201cI was not wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou were not right. Alys is not Arya.\u201d\n\u201cThe vision was a true one. It was my reading that was false. I am as mortal as you, Jon Snow. All mortals err.\u201d\n\u201cEven lord commanders.\u201d Mance Rayder and his spearwives had not returned, and Jon could not help but wonder whether the red woman had lied of a purpose. Is she playing her own game?\n\u201cYou would do well to keep your wolf beside you, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cGhost is seldom far.\u201d The direwolf raised his head at the sound of his name. Jon scratched him behind the ears. \u201cBut now you must excuse me. Ghost, with me.\u201d\nCarved from the base of the Wall and closed with heavy wooden doors, the ice cells ranged from small to smaller. Some were big enough to allow a man to pace, others so small that prisoners were forced to sit; the smallest were too cramped to allow even that.\nJon had given his chief captive the largest cell, a pail to shit in, enough furs to keep him from freezing, and a skin of wine. It took the guards some time to open his cell, as ice had formed inside the lock. Rusted hinges screamed like damned souls when Wick Whittlestick yanked the door wide enough for Jon to slip through. A faint fecal odor greeted him, though less overpowering than he\u2019d expected. Even shit froze solid in such bitter cold. Jon Snow could see his own reflection dimly inside the icy walls.\nIn one corner of the cell a heap of furs was piled up almost to the height of a man. \u201cKarstark,\u201d said Jon Snow. \u201cWake up.\u201d\nThe furs stirred. Some had frozen together, and the frost that covered them glittered when they moved. An arm emerged, then a face\u2014brown hair, tangled and matted and streaked with grey, two fierce eyes, a nose, a mouth, a beard. Ice caked the prisoner\u2019s mustache, clumps of frozen snot. \u201cSnow.\u201d His breath steamed in the air, fogging the ice behind his head. \u201cYou have no right to hold me. The laws of hospitality\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are no guest of mine. You came to the Wall without my leave, armed, to carry off your niece against her will. Lady Alys was given bread and salt. She is a guest. You are a prisoner.\u201d Jon let that hang for a moment, then said, \u201cYour niece is wed.\u201d\nCregan Karstark\u2019s lips skinned back from his teeth. \u201cAlys was promised to me.\u201d Though past fifty, he had been a strong man when he went into the cell. The cold had robbed him of that strength and left him stiff and weak. \u201cMy lord father\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour father is a castellan, not a lord. And a castellan has no right to make marriage pacts.\u201d\n\u201cMy father, Arnolf, is Lord of Karhold.\u201d\n\u201cA son comes before an uncle by all the laws I know.\u201d\nCregan pushed himself to his feet and kicked aside the furs clinging to his ankles. \u201cHarrion is dead.\u201d\nOr will be soon. \u201cA daughter comes before an uncle too. If her brother is dead, Karhold belongs to Lady Alys. And she has given her hand in marriage to Sigorn, Magnar of Thenn.\u201d\n\u201cA wildling. A filthy, murdering wildling.\u201d Cregan\u2019s hands closed into fists. The gloves that covered them were leather, lined with fur to match the cloak that hung matted and stiff from his broad shoulders. His black wool surcoat was emblazoned with the white sunburst of his house. \u201cI see what you are, Snow. Half a wolf and half a wildling, baseborn get of a traitor and a whore. You would deliver a highborn maid to the bed of some stinking savage. Did you sample her yourself first?\u201d He laughed. \u201cIf you mean to kill me, do it and be damned for a kinslayer. Stark and Karstark are one blood.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Snow.\u201d\n\u201cBastard.\u201d\n\u201cGuilty. Of that, at least.\u201d\n\u201cLet this Magnar come to Karhold. We\u2019ll hack off his head and stuff it in a privy, so we can piss into his mouth.\u201d\n\u201cSigorn leads two hundred Thenns,\u201d Jon pointed out, \u201cand Lady Alys believes Karhold will open its gates to her. Two of your men have already sworn her their service and confirmed all she had to say concerning the plans your father made with Ramsay Snow. You have close kin at Karhold, I am told. A word from you could save their lives. Yield the castle. Lady Alys will pardon the women who betrayed her and allow the men to take the black.\u201d\nCregan shook his head. Chunks of ice had formed about the tangles in his hair, and clicked together softly when he moved. \u201cNever,\u201d he said. \u201cNever, never, never.\u201d\nI should make his head a wedding gift for Lady Alys and her Magnar, Jon thought, but dare not take the risk. The Night\u2019s Watch took no part in the quarrels of the realm; some would say he had already given Stannis too much help. Behead this fool, and they will claim I am killing northmen to give their lands to wildlings. Release him, and he will do his best to rip apart all I\u2019ve done with Lady Alys and the Magnar. Jon wondered what his father would do, how his uncle might deal with this. But Eddard Stark was dead, Benjen Stark lost in the frozen wilds beyond the Wall. You know nothing, Jon Snow.\n\u201cNever is a long time,\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou may feel differently on the morrow, or a year from now. Soon or late King Stannis will return to the Wall, however. When he does he will have you put to death\u00a0\u2026\u00a0unless it happens that you are wearing a black cloak. When a man takes the black, his crimes are wiped away.\u201d Even such a man as you. \u201cNow pray excuse me. I have a feast to attend.\u201d\nAfter the biting cold of the ice cells, the crowded cellar was so hot that Jon felt suffocated from the moment he came down the steps. The air smelled of smoke and roasting meat and mulled wine. Axell Florent was making a toast as Jon took his place upon the dais. \u201cTo King Stannis and his wife, Queen Selyse, Light of the North!\u201d Ser Axell bellowed. \u201cTo R\u2019hllor, the Lord of Light, may he defend us all! One land, one god, one king!\u201d\n\u201cOne land, one god, one king!\u201d the queen\u2019s men echoed.\nJon drank with the rest. Whether Alys Karstark would find any joy in her marriage he could not say, but this one night at least should be one of celebration.\nThe stewards began to bring out the first dish, an onion broth flavored with bits of goat and carrot. Not precisely royal fare, but nourishing; it tasted good enough and warmed the belly. Owen the Oaf took up his fiddle, and several of the free folk joined in with pipes and drums. The same pipes and drums they played to sound Mance Rayder\u2019s attack upon the Wall. Jon thought they sounded sweeter now. With the broth came loaves of coarse brown bread, warm from the oven. Salt and butter sat upon the tables. The sight made Jon gloomy. They were well provided with salt, Bowen Marsh had told him, but the last of the butter would be gone within a moon\u2019s turn.\nOld Flint and The Norrey had been given places of high honor just below the dais. Both men had been too old to march with Stannis; they had sent their sons and grandsons in their stead. But they had been quick enough to descend on Castle Black for the wedding. Each had brought a wet nurse to the Wall as well. The Norrey woman was forty, with the biggest breasts Jon Snow had ever seen. The Flint girl was fourteen and flat-chested as a boy, though she did not lack for milk. Between the two of them, the child Val called Monster seemed to be thriving.\nFor that much Jon was grateful\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he did not believe for a moment that two such hoary old warriors would have hied down from their hills for that alone. Each had brought a tail of fighting men\u2014five for Old Flint, twelve for The Norrey, all clad in ragged skins and studded leathers, fearsome as the face of winter. Some had long beards, some had scars, some had both; all worshiped the old gods of the north, those same gods worshiped by the free folk beyond the Wall. Yet here they sat, drinking to a marriage hallowed by some queer red god from beyond the seas.\nBetter that than refuse to drink. Neither Flint nor Norrey had turned their cups over to spill their wine upon the floor. That might betoken a certain acceptance. Or perhaps they just hate to waste good southron wine. They will not have tasted much of it up in those stony hills of theirs.\nBetween courses, Ser Axell Florent led Queen Selyse out onto the floor to dance. Others followed\u2014the queen\u2019s knights first, partnered with her ladies. Ser Brus gave Princess Shireen her first dance, then took a turn with her mother. Ser Narbert danced with each of Selyse\u2019s lady companions in turn.\nThe queen\u2019s men outnumbered the queen\u2019s ladies three to one, so even the humblest serving girls were pressed into the dance. After a few songs some black brothers remembered skills learned at the courts and castles of their youth, before their sins had sent them to the Wall, and took the floor as well. That old rogue Ulmer of the Kingswood proved as adept at dancing as he was at archery, no doubt regaling his partners with his tales of the Kingswood Brotherhood, when he rode with Simon Toyne and Big Belly Ben and helped Wenda the White Fawn burn her mark in the buttocks of her highborn captives. Satin was all grace, dancing with three serving girls in turn but never presuming to approach a highborn lady. Jon judged that wise. He did not like the way some of the queen\u2019s knights were looking at the steward, particularly Ser Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain. That one wants to shed a bit of blood, he thought. He is looking for some provocation.\nWhen Owen the Oaf began to dance with Patchface the fool, laughter echoed off the vaulted ceiling. The sight made Lady Alys smile. \u201cDo you dance often, here at Castle Black?\u201d\n\u201cEvery time we have a wedding, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cYou could dance with me, you know. It would be only courteous. You danced with me anon.\u201d\n\u201cAnon?\u201d teased Jon.\n\u201cWhen we were children.\u201d She tore off a bit of bread and threw it at him. \u201cAs you know well.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady should dance with her husband.\u201d\n\u201cMy Magnar is not one for dancing, I fear. If you will not dance with me, at least pour me some of the mulled wine.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d He signaled for a flagon.\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Alys, as Jon poured, \u201cI am now a woman wed. A wildling husband with his own little wildling army.\u201d\n\u201cFree folk is what they call themselves. Most, at least. The Thenns are a people apart, though. Very old.\u201d Ygritte had told him that. You know nothing, Jon Snow. \u201cThey come from a hidden vale at the north end of the Frostfangs, surrounded by high peaks, and for thousands of years they\u2019ve had more truck with the giants than with other men. It made them different.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent,\u201d she said, \u201cbut more like us.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lady. The Thenns have lords and laws.\u201d They know how to kneel. \u201cThey mine tin and copper for bronze, forge their own arms and armor instead of stealing it. A proud folk, and brave. Mance Rayder had to best the old Magnar thrice before Styr would accept him as King-Beyond-the-Wall.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now they are here, on our side of the Wall. Driven from their mountain fastness and into my bedchamber.\u201d She smiled a wry smile. \u201cIt is my own fault. My lord father told me I must charm your brother Robb, but I was only six and didn\u2019t know how.\u201d\nAye, but now you\u2019re almost six-and-ten, and we must pray you will know how to charm your new husband. \u201cMy lady, how do things stand at Karhold with your food stores?\u201d\n\u201cNot well.\u201d Alys sighed. \u201cMy father took so many of our men south with him that only the women and young boys were left to bring the harvest in. Them, and the men too old or crippled to go off to war. Crops withered in the fields or were pounded into the mud by autumn rains. And now the snows are come. This winter will be hard. Few of the old people will survive it, and many children will perish as well.\u201d\nIt was a tale that any northmen knew well. \u201cMy father\u2019s grandmother was a Flint of the mountains, on his mother\u2019s side,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cThe First Flints, they call themselves. They say the other Flints are the blood of younger sons, who had to leave the mountains to find food and land and wives. It has always been a harsh life up there. When the snows fall and food grows scarce, their young must travel to the winter town or take service at one castle or the other. The old men gather up what strength remains in them and announce that they are going hunting. Some are found come spring. More are never seen again.\u201d\n\u201cIt is much the same at Karhold.\u201d\nThat did not surprise him. \u201cWhen your stores begin to dwindle, my lady, remember us. Send your old men to the Wall, let them say our words. Here at least they will not die alone in the snow, with only memories to warm them. Send us boys as well, if you have boys to spare.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d She touched his hand. \u201cKarhold remembers.\u201d\nThe elk was being carved. It smelled better than Jon had any reason to expect. He dispatched a portion to Leathers out at Hardin\u2019s Tower, along with three big platters of roast vegetables for Wun Wun, then ate a healthy slice himself. Three-Finger Hobb\u2019s acquitted himself well. That had been a concern. Hobb had come to him two nights ago complaining that he\u2019d joined the Night\u2019s Watch to kill wildlings, not to cook for them. \u201cBesides, I never done no wedding feast, m\u2019lord. Black brothers don\u2019t never take no wifes. It\u2019s in the bloody vows, I swear \u2019tis.\u201d\nJon was washing the roast down with a sip of mulled wine when Clydas appeared at his elbow. \u201cA bird,\u201d he announced, and slipped a parchment into Jon\u2019s hand. The note was sealed with a dot of hard black wax. Eastwatch, Jon knew, even before he broke the seal. The letter had been written by Maester Harmune; Cotter Pyke could neither read nor write. But the words were Pyke\u2019s, set down as he had spoken them, blunt and to the point.",

      "content": "\u201cDark wings, dark words?\u201d asked Alys Karstark.\n\u201cNo, my lady. This news was long awaited.\u201d Though the last part troubles me. Glendon Hewett was a seasoned man and a strong one, a sensible choice to command in Cotter Pyke\u2019s absence. But he was also as much a friend as Alliser Thorne could boast, and a crony of sorts with Janos Slynt, however briefly. Jon could still recall how Hewett had dragged him from his bed, and the feel of his boot slamming into his ribs. Not the man I would have chosen. He rolled the parchment up and slipped it into his belt.\nThe fish course was next, but as the pike was being boned Lady Alys dragged the Magnar up onto the floor. From the way he moved it was plain that Sigorn had never danced before, but he had drunk enough mulled wine so that it did not seem to matter.\n\u201cA northern maid and a wildling warrior, bound together by the Lord of Light.\u201d Ser Axell Florent slipped into Lady Alys\u2019s vacant seat. \u201cHer Grace approves. I am close to her, my lord, so I know her mind. King Stannis will approve as well.\u201d\nUnless Roose Bolton has stuck his head on a spear.\n\u201cNot all agree, alas.\u201d Ser Axell\u2019s beard was a ragged brush beneath his sagging chin; coarse hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils. \u201cSer Patrek feels he would have made a better match for Lady Alys. His lands were lost to him when he came north.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many in this hall who have lost far more than that,\u201d said Jon, \u201cand more who have given up their lives in service to the realm. Ser Patrek should count himself fortunate.\u201d\nAxell Florent smiled. \u201cThe king might say the same if he were here. Yet some provision must be made for His Grace\u2019s leal knights, surely? They have followed him so far and at such cost. And we must needs bind these wildlings to king and realm. This marriage is a good first step, but I know that it would please the queen to see the wildling princess wed as well.\u201d\nJon sighed. He was weary of explaining that Val was no true princess. No matter how often he told them, they never seemed to hear. \u201cYou are persistent, Ser Axell, I grant you that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you blame me, my lord? Such a prize is not easily won. A nubile girl, I hear, and not hard to look upon. Good hips, good breasts, well made for whelping children.\u201d\n\u201cWho would father these children? Ser Patrek? You?\u201d\n\u201cWho better? We Florents have the blood of the old Gardener kings in our veins. Lady Melisandre could perform the rites, as she did for Lady Alys and the Magnar.\u201d\n\u201cAll you are lacking is a bride.\u201d\n\u201cEasily remedied.\u201d Florent\u2019s smile was so false that it looked painful. \u201cWhere is she, Lord Snow? Have you moved her to one of your other castles? Greyguard or the Shadow Tower? Whore\u2019s Burrow, with t\u2019other wenches?\u201d He leaned close. \u201cSome say you have her tucked away for your own pleasure. It makes no matter to me, so long as she is not with child. I\u2019ll get my own sons on her. If you\u2019ve broken her to saddle, well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we are both men of the world, are we not?\u201d\nJon had heard enough. \u201cSer Axell, if you are truly the Queen\u2019s Hand, I pity Her Grace.\u201d\nFlorent\u2019s face grew flushed with anger. \u201cSo it is true. You mean to keep her for yourself, I see it now. The bastard wants his father\u2019s seat.\u201d\nThe bastard refused his father\u2019s seat. If the bastard had wanted Val, all he had to do was ask for her. \u201cYou must excuse me, ser,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a breath of fresh air.\u201d It stinks in here. His head turned. \u201cThat was a horn.\u201d\nOthers had heard it too. The music and the laughter died at once. Dancers froze in place, listening. Even Ghost pricked up his ears. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Queen Selyse asked her knights.\n\u201cA warhorn, Your Grace,\u201d said Ser Narbert.\nThe queen\u2019s hand went fluttering to her throat. \u201cAre we under attack?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Your Grace,\u201d said Ulmer of the Kingswood. \u201cIt\u2019s the watchers on the Wall, is all.\u201d\nOne blast, thought Jon Snow. Rangers returning.\nThen it came again. The sound seemed to fill the cellar.\n\u201cTwo blasts,\u201d said Mully.\nBlack brothers, northmen, free folk, Thenns, queen\u2019s men, all of them fell quiet, listening. Five heartbeats passed. Ten. Twenty. Then Owen the Oaf tittered, and Jon Snow could breathe again. \u201cTwo blasts,\u201d he announced. \u201cWildlings.\u201d Val.\nTormund Giantsbane had come at last.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe hall rang to Yunkish laughter, Yunkish songs, Yunkish prayers. Dancers danced; musicians played queer tunes with bells and squeaks and bladders; singers sang ancient love songs in the incomprehensible tongue of Old Ghis. Wine flowed\u2014not the thin pale stuff of Slaver\u2019s Bay but rich sweet vintages from the Arbor and dreamwine from Qarth, flavored with strange spices. The Yunkai\u2019i had come at King Hizdahr\u2019s invitation, to sign the peace and witness the rebirth of Meereen\u2019s far-famed fighting pits. Her noble husband had opened the Great Pyramid to fete them.\nI hate this, thought Daenerys Targaryen. How did this happen, that I am drinking and smiling with men I\u2019d sooner flay?\nA dozen different sorts of meat and fish were served: camel, crocodile, singing squid, lacquered ducks and spiny grubs, with goat and ham and horse for those whose tastes were less exotic. Plus dog. No Ghiscari feast was complete without a course of dog. Hizdahr\u2019s cooks prepared dog four different ways. \u201cGhiscari will eat anything that swims or flies or crawls, but for man and dragon,\u201d Daario had warned her, \u201cand I\u2019d wager they\u2019d eat dragon too if given half a chance.\u201d Meat alone does not make a meal, though, so there were fruits and grains and vegetables as well. The air was redolent with the scents of saffron, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and other costly spices.\nDany scarce touched a bite. This is peace, she told herself. This is what I wanted, what I worked for, this is why I married Hizdahr. So why does it taste so much like defeat?\n\u201cIt is only for a little while more, my love,\u201d Hizdahr had assured her. \u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i will soon be gone, and their allies and hirelings with them. We shall have all we desired. Peace, food, trade. Our port is open once again, and ships are being permitted to come and go.\u201d\n\u201cThey are permitting that, yes,\u201d she had replied, \u201cbut their warships remain. They can close their fingers around our throat again whenever they wish. They have opened a slave market within sight of my walls!\u201d\n\u201cOutside our walls, sweet queen. That was a condition of the peace, that Yunkai would be free to trade in slaves as before, unmolested.\u201d\n\u201cIn their own city. Not where I have to see it.\u201d The Wise Masters had established their slave pens and auction block just south of the Skahazadhan, where the wide brown river flowed into Slaver\u2019s Bay. \u201cThey are mocking me to my face, making a show of how powerless I am to stop them.\u201d\n\u201cPosing and posturing,\u201d said her noble husband. \u201cA show, as you have said. Let them have their mummery. When they are gone, we will make a fruit market of what they leave behind.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they are gone,\u201d Dany repeated. \u201cAnd when will they be gone? Riders have been seen beyond the Skahazadhan. Dothraki scouts, Rakharo says, with a khalasar behind them. They will have captives. Men, women, and children, gifts for the slavers.\u201d Dothraki did not buy or sell, but they gave gifts and received them. \u201cThat is why the Yunkai\u2019i have thrown up this market. They will leave here with thousands of new slaves.\u201d\nHizdahr zo Loraq shrugged. \u201cBut they will leave. That is the important part, my love. Yunkai will trade in slaves, Meereen will not, this is what we have agreed. Endure this for a little while longer, and it shall pass.\u201d\nSo Daenerys sat silent through the meal, wrapped in a vermilion tokar and black thoughts, speaking only when spoken to, brooding on the men and women being bought and sold outside her walls, even as they feasted here within the city. Let her noble husband make the speeches and laugh at the feeble Yunkish japes. That was a king\u2019s right and a king\u2019s duty.\nMuch of the talk about the table was of the matches to be fought upon the morrow. Barsena Blackhair was going to face a boar, his tusks against her dagger. Khrazz was fighting, as was the Spotted Cat. And in the day\u2019s final pairing, Goghor the Giant would go against Belaquo Bonebreaker. One would be dead before the sun went down. No queen has clean hands, Dany told herself. She thought of Doreah, of Quaro, of Eroeh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0of a little girl she had never met, whose name had been Hazzea. Better a few should die in the pit than thousands at the gates. This is the price of peace, I pay it willingly. If I look back, I am lost.\nThe Yunkish Supreme Commander, Yurkhaz zo Yunzak, might have been alive during Aegon\u2019s Conquest, to judge by his appearance. Bent-backed, wrinkled, and toothless, he was carried to the table by two strapping slaves. The other Yunkish lords were hardly more impressive. One was small and stunted, though the slave soldiers who attended him were grotesquely tall and thin. The third was young, fit, and dashing, but so drunk that Dany could scarce understand a word he said. How could I have been brought to this pass by creatures such as these?\nThe sellswords were a different matter. Each of the four free companies serving Yunkai had sent its commander. The Windblown were represented by the Pentoshi nobleman known as the Tattered Prince, the Long Lances by Gylo Rhegan, who looked more shoemaker than soldier and spoke in murmurs. Bloodbeard, from the Company of the Cat, made enough noise for him and a dozen more. A huge man with a great bush of beard and a prodigious appetite for wine and women, he bellowed, belched, farted like a thunderclap, and pinched every serving girl who came within his reach. From time to time he would pull one down into his lap to squeeze her breasts and fondle her between the legs.\nThe Second Sons were represented too. If Daario were here, this meal would end in blood. No promised peace could ever have persuaded her captain to permit Brown Ben Plumm to stroll back into Meereen and leave alive. Dany had sworn that no harm would come to the seven envoys and commanders, though that had not been enough for the Yunkai\u2019i. They had required hostages of her as well. To balance the three Yunkish nobles and four sellsword captains, Meereen sent seven of its own out to the siege camp: Hizdahr\u2019s sister, two of his cousins, Dany\u2019s bloodrider Jhogo, her admiral Groleo, the Unsullied captain Hero, and Daario Naharis.\n\u201cI will leave my girls with you,\u201d her captain had said, handing her his sword belt and its gilded wantons. \u201cKeep them safe for me, beloved. We would not want them making bloody mischief amongst the Yunkai\u2019i.\u201d\nThe Shavepate was absent as well. The first thing Hizdahr had done upon being crowned was to remove him from command of the Brazen Beasts, replacing him with his own cousin, the plump and pasty Marghaz zo Loraq. It is for the best. The Green Grace says there is blood between Loraq and Kandaq, and the Shavepate never made a secret of his disdain for my lord husband. And Daario\u00a0\u2026\nDaario had only grown wilder since her wedding. Her peace did not please him, her marriage pleased him less, and he had been furious at being deceived by the Dornishmen. When Prince Quentyn told them that the other Westerosi had come over to the Stormcrows at the command of the Tattered Prince, only the intercession of Grey Worm and his Unsullied prevented Daario from killing them all. The false deserters had been imprisoned safely in the bowels of the pyramid\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Daario\u2019s rage continued to fester.\nHe will be safer as a hostage. My captain was not made for peace. Dany could not risk his cutting down Brown Ben Plumm, making mock of Hizdahr before the court, provoking the Yunkai\u2019i, or otherwise upsetting the agreement that she had given up so much to win. Daario was war and woe. Henceforth, she must keep him out of her bed, out of her heart, and out of her. If he did not betray her, he would master her. She did not know which of those she feared the most.\nWhen the gluttony was done and all the half-eaten food had been cleared away\u2014to be given to the poor who gathered below, at the queen\u2019s insistence\u2014tall glass flutes were filled with a spiced liqueur from Qarth as dark as amber. Then began the entertainments.\nA troupe of Yunkish castrati owned by Yurkhaz zo Yunzak sang them songs in the ancient tongue of the Old Empire, their voices high and sweet and impossibly pure. \u201cHave you ever heard such singing, my love?\u201d Hizdahr asked her. \u201cThey have the voices of gods, do they not?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cthough I wonder if they might not have preferred to have the fruits of men.\u201d\nAll of the entertainers were slaves. That had been part of the peace, that slaveowners be allowed the right to bring their chattels into Meereen without fear of having them freed. In return the Yunkai\u2019i had promised to respect the rights and liberties of the former slaves that Dany had freed. A fair bargain, Hizdahr said, but the taste it left in the queen\u2019s mouth was foul. She drank another cup of wine to wash it out.\n\u201cIf it please you, Yurkhaz will be pleased to give us the singers, I do not doubt,\u201d her noble husband said. \u201cA gift to seal our peace, an ornament to our court.\u201d\nHe will give us these castrati, Dany thought, and then he will march home and make some more. The world is full of boys.\nThe tumblers who came next failed to move her either, even when they formed a human pyramid nine levels high, with a naked little girl on top. Is that meant to represent my pyramid? the queen wondered. Is the girl on top meant to be me?\nAfterward her lord husband led his guests onto the lower terrace, so the visitors from the Yellow City might behold Meereen by night. Wine cups in hand, the Yunkai\u2019i wandered the garden in small groups, beneath lemon trees and night-blooming flowers, and Dany found herself face-to-face with Brown Ben Plumm.\nHe bowed low. \u201cWorship. You look lovely. Well, you always did. None of them Yunkishmen are half so pretty. I thought I might bring a wedding gift for you, but the bidding went too high for old Brown Ben.\u201d\n\u201cI want no gifts from you.\u201d\n\u201cThis one you might. The head of an old foe.\u201d\n\u201cYour own?\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cYou betrayed me.\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a harsh way o\u2019 putting it, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d Brown Ben scratched at his speckled grey-and-white whiskers. \u201cWe went over to the winning side, is all. Same as we done before. It weren\u2019t all me, neither. I put it to my men.\u201d\n\u201cSo they betrayed me, is that what you are saying? Why? Did I mistreat the Second Sons? Did I cheat you on your pay?\u201d\n\u201cNever that,\u201d said Brown Ben, \u201cbut it\u2019s not all about the coin, Your High-and-Mightiness. I learned that a long time back, at my first battle. Morning after the fight, I was rooting through the dead, looking for the odd bit o\u2019 plunder, as it were. Came upon this one corpse, some axeman had taken his whole arm off at the shoulder. He was covered with flies, all crusty with dried blood, might be why no one else had touched him, but under them he wore this studded jerkin, looked to be good leather. I figured it might fit me well enough, so I chased away the flies and cut it off him. The damn thing was heavier than it had any right to be, though. Under the lining, he\u2019d sewn a fortune in coin. Gold, Your Worship, sweet yellow gold. Enough for any man to live like a lord for the rest o\u2019 his days. But what good did it do him? There he was with all his coin, lying in the blood and mud with his fucking arm cut off. And that\u2019s the lesson, see? Silver\u2019s sweet and gold\u2019s our mother, but once you\u2019re dead they\u2019re worth less than that last shit you take as you lie dying. I told you once, there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords, but there are no old bold sellswords. My boys didn\u2019t care to die, that\u2019s all, and when I told them that you couldn\u2019t unleash them dragons against the Yunkishmen, well\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nYou saw me as defeated, Dany thought, and who am I to say that you were wrong? \u201cI understand.\u201d She might have ended it there, but she was curious. \u201cEnough gold to live like a lord, you said. What did you do with all that wealth?\u201d\nBrown Ben laughed. \u201cFool boy that I was, I told a man I took to be my friend, and he told our serjeant, and my brothers-in-arms come and relieved me o\u2019 that burden. Serjeant said I was too young, that I\u2019d only waste it all on whores and such. He let me keep the jerkin, though.\u201d He spat. \u201cYou don\u2019t never want to trust a sellsword, m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cI have learned that much. One day I must be sure to thank you for the lesson.\u201d\nBrown Ben\u2019s eyes crinkled up. \u201cNo need. I know the sort o\u2019 thanks you have in mind.\u201d He bowed again and moved away.\nDany turned to gaze out over her city. Beyond her walls the yellow tents of the Yunkai\u2019i stood in orderly rows beside the sea, protected by the ditches their slaves had dug for them. Two iron legions out of New Ghis, trained and armed in the same fashion as Unsullied, were encamped across the river to the north. Two more Ghiscari legions had made camp to the east, choking off the road to the Khyzai Pass. The horse lines and cookfires of the free companies lay to the south. By day thin plumes of smoke hung against the sky like ragged grey ribbons. By night distant fires could be seen. Hard by the bay was the abomination, the slave market at her door. She could not see it now, with the sun set, but she knew that it was there. That just made her angrier.\n\u201cSer Barristan?\u201d she said softly.\nThe white knight appeared at once. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d\n\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d\n\u201cEnough. He was not wrong. Never trust a sellsword.\u201d\nOr a queen, thought Dany. \u201cIs there some man in the Second Sons who might be persuaded to\u00a0\u2026\u00a0remove\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Brown Ben?\u201d\n\u201cAs Daario Naharis once removed the other captains of the Stormcrows?\u201d The old knight looked uncomfortable. \u201cPerhaps. I would not know, Your Grace.\u201d\nNo, she thought, you are too honest and too honorable. \u201cIf not, the Yunkai\u2019i employ three other companies.\u201d\n\u201cRogues and cutthroats, scum of a hundred battlefields,\u201d Ser Barristan warned, \u201cwith captains full as treacherous as Plumm.\u201d\n\u201cI am only a young girl and know little of such things, but it seems to me that we want them to be treacherous. Once, you\u2019ll recall, I convinced the Second Sons and Stormcrows to join us.\u201d\n\u201cIf Your Grace wishes a privy word with Gylo Rhegan or the Tattered Prince, I could bring them up to your apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the time. Too many eyes, too many ears. Their absence would be noted even if you could separate them discreetly from the Yunkai\u2019i. We must find some quieter way of reaching out to them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0not tonight, but soon.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command. Though I fear this is not a task for which I am well suited. In King\u2019s Landing work of this sort was left to Lord Littlefinger or the Spider. We old knights are simple men, only good for fighting.\u201d He patted his sword hilt.\n\u201cOur prisoners,\u201d suggested Dany. \u201cThe Westerosi who came over from the Windblown with the three Dornishmen. We still have them in cells, do we not? Use them.\u201d\n\u201cFree them, you mean? Is that wise? They were sent here to worm their way into your trust, so they might betray Your Grace at the first chance.\u201d\n\u201cThen they failed. I do not trust them. I will never trust them.\u201d If truth be told, Dany was forgetting how to trust. \u201cWe can still use them. One was a woman. Meris. Send her back, as a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a gesture of my regard. If their captain is a clever man, he will understand.\u201d\n\u201cThe woman is the worst of all.\u201d\n\u201cAll the better.\u201d Dany considered a moment. \u201cWe should sound out the Long Lances too. And the Company of the Cat.\u201d\n\u201cBloodbeard.\u201d Ser Barristan\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cIf it please Your Grace, we want no part of him. Your Grace is too young to remember the Ninepenny Kings, but this Bloodbeard is cut from the same savage cloth. There is no honor in him, only hunger\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for gold, for glory, for blood.\u201d\n\u201cYou know more of such men than me, ser.\u201d If Bloodbeard might be truly the most dishonorable and greedy of the sellswords, he might be the easiest to sway, but she was loath to go against Ser Barristan\u2019s counsel in such matters. \u201cDo as you think best. But do it soon. If Hizdahr\u2019s peace should break, I want to be ready. I do not trust the slavers.\u201d I do not trust my husband. \u201cThey will turn on us at the first sign of weakness.\u201d\n\u201cThe Yunkai\u2019i grow weaker as well. The bloody flux has taken hold amongst the Tolosi, it is said, and spread across the river to the third Ghiscari legion.\u201d\nThe pale mare. Daenerys sighed. Quaithe warned me of the pale mare\u2019s coming. She told me of the Dornish prince as well, the sun\u2019s son. She told me much and more, but all in riddles. \u201cI cannot rely on plague to save me from my enemies. Set Pretty Meris free. At once.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command. Though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Your Grace, if I may be so bold, there is another road\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Dornish road?\u201d Dany sighed. The three Dornishmen had been at the feast, as befit Prince Quentyn\u2019s rank, though Reznak had taken care to seat them as far as possible from her husband. Hizdahr did not seem to be of a jealous nature, but no man would be pleased by the presence of a rival suitor near his new bride. \u201cThe boy seems pleasant and well spoken, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHouse Martell is ancient and noble, and has been a leal friend to House Targaryen for more than a century, Your Grace. I had the honor of serving with Prince Quentyn\u2019s great-uncle in your father\u2019s seven. Prince Lewyn was as valiant a brother-in-arms as any man could wish for. Quentyn Martell is of the same blood, if it please Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cIt would please me if he had turned up with these fifty thousand swords he speaks of. Instead he brings two knights and a parchment. Will a parchment shield my people from the Yunkai\u2019i? If he had come with a fleet\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSunspear has never been a sea power, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Dany knew enough of Westerosi history to know that. Nymeria had landed ten thousand ships upon Dorne\u2019s sandy shores, but when she wed her Dornish prince she had burned them all and turned her back upon the sea forever. \u201cDorne is too far away. To please this prince, I would need to abandon all my people. You should send him home.\u201d\n\u201cDornishmen are notoriously stubborn, Your Grace. Prince Quentyn\u2019s forebears fought your own for the better part of two hundred years. He will not go without you.\u201d\nThen he will die here, Daenerys thought, unless there is more to him than I can see. \u201cIs he still within?\u201d\n\u201cDrinking with his knights.\u201d\n\u201cBring him to me. It is time he met my children.\u201d\nA flicker of doubt passed across the long, solemn face of Barristan Selmy. \u201cAs you command.\u201d\nHer king was laughing with Yurkhaz zo Yunzak and the other Yunkish lords. Dany did not think that he would miss her, but just in case she instructed her handmaids to tell him that she was answering a call of nature, should he inquire after her.\nSer Barristan was waiting by the steps with the Dornish prince. Martell\u2019s square face was flushed and ruddy. Too much wine, the queen concluded, though he was doing his best to conceal that. Apart from the line of copper suns that ornamented his belt, the Dornishman was plainly dressed. They call him Frog, Dany recalled. She could see why. He was not a handsome man.\nShe smiled. \u201cMy prince. It is a long way down. Are you certain that you wish to do this?\u201d\n\u201cIf it would please Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cThen come.\u201d\nA pair of Unsullied went down the steps before them, bearing torches; behind came two Brazen Beasts, one masked as a fish, the other as a hawk. Even here in her own pyramid, on this happy night of peace and celebration, Ser Barristan insisted on keeping guards about her everywhere she went. The small company made the long descent in silence, stopping thrice to refresh themselves along the way. \u201cThe dragon has three heads,\u201d Dany said when they were on the final flight. \u201cMy marriage need not be the end of all your hopes. I know why you are here.\u201d\n\u201cFor you,\u201d said Quentyn, all awkward gallantry.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dany. \u201cFor fire and blood.\u201d\nOne of the elephants trumpeted at them from his stall. An answering roar from below made her flush with sudden heat. Prince Quentyn looked up in alarm. \u201cThe dragons know when she is near,\u201d Ser Barristan told him.\nEvery child knows its mother, Dany thought. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves\u00a0\u2026 \u201cThey call to me. Come.\u201d She took Prince Quentyn by the hand and led him to the pit where two of her dragons were confined. \u201cRemain outside,\u201d Dany told Ser Barristan, as the Unsullied were opening the huge iron doors. \u201cPrince Quentyn will protect me.\u201d She drew the Dornish prince inside with her, to stand above the pit.\nThe dragons craned their necks around, gazing at them with burning eyes. Viserion had shattered one chain and melted the others. He clung to the roof of the pit like some huge white bat, his claws dug deep into the burnt and crumbling bricks. Rhaegal, still chained, was gnawing on the carcass of a bull. The bones on the floor of the pit were deeper than the last time she had been down here, and the walls and floors were black and grey, more ash than brick. They would not hold much longer\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but behind them was only earth and stone. Can dragons tunnel through rock, like the firewyrms of old Valyria? She hoped not.\nThe Dornish prince had gone as white as milk. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I had heard that there were three.\u201d\n\u201cDrogon is hunting.\u201d He did not need to hear the rest. \u201cThe white one is Viserion, the green is Rhaegal. I named them for my brothers.\u201d Her voice echoed off the scorched stone walls. It sounded small\u2014a girl\u2019s voice, not the voice of a queen and conqueror, nor the glad voice of a new-made bride.\nRhaegal roared in answer, and fire filled the pit, a spear of red and yellow. Viserion replied, his own flames gold and orange. When he flapped his wings, a cloud of grey ash filled the air. Broken chains clanked and clattered about his legs. Quentyn Martell jumped back a foot.\nA crueler woman might have laughed at him, but Dany squeezed his hand and said, \u201cThey frighten me as well. There is no shame in that. My children have grown wild and angry in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you mean to ride them?\u201d\n\u201cOne of them. All I know of dragons is what my brother told me when I was a girl, and some I read in books, but it is said that even Aegon the Conqueror never dared mount Vhagar or Meraxes, nor did his sisters ride Balerion the Black Dread. Dragons live longer than men, some for hundreds of years, so Balerion had other riders after Aegon died\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no rider ever flew two dragons.\u201d\nViserion hissed again. Smoke rose between his teeth, and deep down in his throat they could see gold fire churning.\n\u201cThey are\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they are fearsome creatures.\u201d\n\u201cThey are dragons, Quentyn.\u201d Dany stood on her toes and kissed him lightly, once on each cheek. \u201cAnd so am I.\u201d\nThe young prince swallowed. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have the blood of the dragon in me as well, Your Grace. I can trace my lineage back to the first Daenerys, the Targaryen princess who was sister to King Daeron the Good and wife to the Prince of Dorne. He built the Water Gardens for her.\u201d\n\u201cThe Water Gardens?\u201d She knew little and less of Dorne or its history, if truth be told.\n\u201cMy father\u2019s favorite palace. It would please me to show them to you one day. They are all of pink marble, with pools and fountains, overlooking the sea.\u201d\n\u201cThey sound lovely.\u201d She drew him away from the pit. He does not belong here. He should never have come. \u201cYou ought to return there. My court is no safe place for you, I fear. You have more enemies than you know. You made Daario look a fool, and he is not a man to forget such a slight.\u201d\n\u201cI have my knights. My sworn shields.\u201d\n\u201cTwo knights. Daario has five hundred Stormcrows. And you would do well to beware of my lord husband too. He seems a mild and pleasant man, I know, but do not be deceived. Hizdahr\u2019s crown derives from mine, and he commands the allegiance of some of the most fearsome fighters in the world. If one of them should think to win his favor by disposing of a rival\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI am a prince of Dorne, Your Grace. I will not run from slaves and sell swords.\u201d\nThen you truly are a fool, Prince Frog. Dany gave her wild children one last lingering look. She could hear the dragons screaming as she led the boy back to the door, and see the play of light against the bricks, reflections of their fires. If I look back, I am lost. \u201cSer Barristan will have summoned a pair of sedan chairs to carry us back up to the banquet, but the climb can still be wearisome.\u201d Behind them, the great iron doors closed with a resounding clang. \u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I should of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom. I never had a maester growing up.\u201d Only a brother.\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure, Your Grace,\u201d said Quentyn.\nIt was well past midnight before the last of their guests took their leave and Dany retired to her own apartments to join her lord and king. Hizdahr at least was happy, if somewhat drunk. \u201cI keep my promises,\u201d he told her, as Irri and Jhiqui were robing them for bed. \u201cYou wished for peace, and it is yours.\u201d\nAnd you wished for blood, and soon enough I must give it to you, Dany thought, but what she said was, \u201cI am grateful.\u201d\nThe excitement of the day had inflamed her husband\u2019s passions. No sooner had her handmaids retired for the night than he tore the robe from her and tumbled her backwards into bed. Dany slid her arms around him and let him have his way. Drunk as he was, she knew he would not be inside her long.\nNor was he. Afterward he nuzzled at her ear and whispered, \u201cGods grant that we have made a son tonight.\u201d\nThe words of Mirri Maz Duur rang in her head. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before. The meaning was plain enough; Khal Drogo was as like to return from the dead as she was to bear a living child. But there are some secrets she could not bring herself to share, even with a husband, so she let Hizdahr zo Loraq keep his hopes.\nHer noble husband was soon fast asleep. Daenerys could only twist and turn beside him. She wanted to shake him, wake him, make him hold her, kiss her, fuck her again, but even if he did, he would fall back to sleep again afterward, leaving her alone in the darkness. She wondered what Daario was doing. Was he restless as well? Was he thinking about her? Did he love her, truly? Did he hate her for marrying Hizdahr? I should never have taken him into my bed. He was only a sellsword, no fit consort for a queen, and yet\u00a0\u2026\nI knew that all along, but I did it anyway.\n\u201cMy queen?\u201d said a soft voice in the darkness.\nDany flinched. \u201cWho is there?\u201d\n\u201cOnly Missandei.\u201d The Naathi scribe moved closer to the bed. \u201cThis one heard you crying.\u201d\n\u201cCrying? I was not crying. Why would I cry? I have my peace, I have my king, I have everything a queen might wish for. You had a bad dream, that was all.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Your Grace.\u201d She bowed and made to go.\n\u201cStay,\u201d said Dany. \u201cI do not wish to be alone.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is with you,\u201d Missandei pointed out.\n\u201cHis Grace is dreaming, but I cannot sleep. On the morrow I must bathe in blood. The price of peace.\u201d She smiled wanly and patted the bed. \u201cCome. Sit. Talk with me.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please you.\u201d Missandei sat down beside her. \u201cWhat shall we talk of?\u201d\n\u201cHome,\u201d said Dany. \u201cNaath. Butterflies and brothers. Tell me of the things that make you happy, the things that make you giggle, all your sweetest memories. Remind me that there is still good in the world.\u201d\nMissandei did her best. She was still talking when Dany finally fell to sleep, to dream queer, half-formed dreams of smoke and fire.\nThe morning came too soon.",

      "content": "THEON\nDay stole upon them just as Stannis had: unseen.\nWinterfell had been awake for hours, its battlements and towers crammed with men in wool and mail and leather awaiting an attack that never came. By the time the sky began to lighten the sound of drums had faded away, though warhorns were heard thrice more, each time a little closer. And still the snow fell.\n\u201cThe storm will end today,\u201d one of the surviving stableboys was insisting loudly. \u201cWhy, it isn\u2019t even winter.\u201d Theon would have laughed if he had dared. He remembered tales Old Nan had told them of storms that raged for forty days and forty nights, for a year, for ten years\u00a0\u2026\u00a0storms that buried castles and cities and whole kingdoms under a hundred feet of snow.\nHe sat in the back of the Great Hall, not far from the horses, watching Abel, Rowan, and a mousy brown-haired washerwoman called Squirrel attack slabs of stale brown bread fried in bacon grease. Theon broke his own fast with a tankard of dark ale, cloudy with yeast and thick enough to chew on. A few more tankards, and perhaps Abel\u2019s plan might not seem quite so mad.\nRoose Bolton entered, pale-eyed and yawning, accompanied by his plump and pregnant wife, Fat Walda. Several lords and captains had preceded him, amongst them Whoresbane Umber, Aenys Frey, and Roger Ryswell. Farther down the table Wyman Manderly sat wolfing down sausages and boiled eggs, whilst old Lord Locke beside him spooned gruel into his toothless mouth.\nLord Ramsay soon appeared as well, buckling on his sword belt as he made his way to the front of the hall. His mood is foul this morning. Theon could tell. The drums kept him awake all night, he guessed, or someone has displeased him. One wrong word, an ill-considered look, an ill-timed laugh, any of them could provoke his lordship\u2019s wroth and cost a man a strip of skin. Please, m\u2019lord, don\u2019t look this way. One glance would be all it would take for Ramsay to know everything. He\u2019ll see it written on my face. He\u2019ll know. He always knows.\nTheon turned to Abel. \u201cThis will not work.\u201d His voice was pitched so low that even the horses could not have overheard. \u201cWe will be caught before we leave the castle. Even if we do escape, Lord Ramsay will hunt us down, him and Ben Bones and the girls.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis is outside the walls, and not far by the sound of it. All we need do is reach him.\u201d Abel\u2019s fingers danced across the strings of his lute. The singer\u2019s beard was brown, though his long hair had largely gone to grey. \u201cIf the Bastard does come after us, he might live long enough to rue it.\u201d\nThink that, Theon thought. Believe that. Tell yourself it\u2019s true. \u201cRamsay will use your women as his prey,\u201d he told the singer. \u201cHe\u2019ll hunt them down, rape them, and feed their corpses to his dogs. If they lead him a good chase, he may name his next litter of bitches after them. You he\u2019ll flay. Him and Skinner and Damon Dance-for-Me, they will make a game of it. You\u2019ll be begging them to kill you.\u201d He clutched the singer\u2019s arm with a maimed hand. \u201cYou swore you would not let me fall into his hands again. I have your word on that.\u201d He needed to hear it again.\n\u201cAbel\u2019s word,\u201d said Squirrel. \u201cStrong as oak.\u201d Abel himself only shrugged. \u201cNo matter what, my prince.\u201d\nUp on the dais, Ramsay was arguing with his father. They were too far away for Theon to make out any of the words, but the fear on Fat Walda\u2019s round pink face spoke volumes. He did hear Wyman Manderly calling for more sausages and Roger Ryswell\u2019s laughter at some jape from one-armed Harwood Stout.\nTheon wondered if he would ever see the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls, or if his ghost would linger here at Winterfell. Dead is dead. Better dead than Reek. If Abel\u2019s scheme went awry, Ramsay would make their dying long and hard. He will flay me from head to heel this time, and no amount of begging will end the anguish. No pain Theon had ever known came close to the agony that Skinner could evoke with a little flensing blade. Abel would learn that lesson soon enough. And for what? Jeyne, her name is Jeyne, and her eyes are the wrong color. A mummer playing a part. Lord Bolton knows, and Ramsay, but the rest are blind, even this bloody bard with his sly smiles. The jape is on you, Abel, you and your murdering whores. You\u2019ll die for the wrong girl.\nHe had come this close to telling them the truth when Rowan had delivered him to Abel in the ruins of the Burned Tower, but at the last instant he had held his tongue. The singer seemed intent on making off with the daughter of Eddard Stark. If he knew that Lord Ramsay\u2019s bride was but a steward\u2019s whelp, well\u00a0\u2026\nThe doors of the Great Hall opened with a crash.\nA cold wind came swirling through, and a cloud of ice crystals sparkled blue-white in the air. Through it strode Ser Hosteen Frey, caked with snow to the waist, a body in his arms. All along the benches men put down their cups and spoons to turn and gape at the grisly spectacle. The hall grew quiet.\nAnother murder.\nSnow slid from Ser Hosteen\u2019s cloaks as he stalked toward the high table, his steps ringing against the floor. A dozen Frey knights and men-at-arms entered behind him. One was a boy Theon knew\u2014Big Walder, the little one, fox-faced and skinny as a stick. His chest and arms and cloak were spattered with blood.\nThe scent of it set the horses to screaming. Dogs slid out from under the tables, sniffing. Men rose from the benches. The body in Ser Hosteen\u2019s arms sparkled in the torchlight, armored in pink frost. The cold outside had frozen his blood.\n\u201cMy brother Merrett\u2019s son.\u201d Hosteen Frey lowered the body to the floor before the dais. \u201cButchered like a hog and shoved beneath a snowbank. A boy.\u201d\nLittle Walder, thought Theon. The big one. He glanced at Rowan. There are six of them, he remembered. Any of them could have done this. But the washerwoman felt his eyes. \u201cThis was no work of ours,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Abel warned her.\nLord Ramsay descended from the dais to the dead boy. His father rose more slowly, pale-eyed, still-faced, solemn. \u201cThis was foul work.\u201d For once Roose Bolton\u2019s voice was loud enough to carry. \u201cWhere was the body found?\u201d\n\u201cUnder that ruined keep, my lord,\u201d replied Big Walder. \u201cThe one with the old gargoyles.\u201d The boy\u2019s gloves were caked with his cousin\u2019s blood. \u201cI told him not to go out alone, but he said he had to find a man who owed him silver.\u201d\n\u201cWhat man?\u201d Ramsay demanded. \u201cGive me his name. Point him out to me, boy, and I will make you a cloak of his skin.\u201d\n\u201cHe never said, my lord. Only that he won the coin at dice.\u201d The Frey boy hesitated. \u201cIt was some White Harbor men who taught dice. I couldn\u2019t say which ones, but it was them.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d boomed Hosteen Frey. \u201cWe know the man who did this. Killed this boy and all the rest. Not by his own hand, no. He is too fat and craven to do his own killing. But by his word.\u201d He turned to Wyman Manderly. \u201cDo you deny it?\u201d\nThe Lord of White Harbor bit a sausage in half. \u201cI confess\u00a0\u2026\u201d He wiped the grease from his lips with his sleeve. \u201c\u2026\u00a0I confess that I know little of this poor boy. Lord Ramsay\u2019s squire, was he not? How old was the lad?\u201d\n\u201cNine, on his last nameday.\u201d\n\u201cSo young,\u201d said Wyman Manderly. \u201cThough mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.\u201d\nSer Hosteen slammed his foot into the tabletop, knocking it off its trestles, back into Lord Wyman\u2019s swollen belly. Cups and platters flew, sausages scattered everywhere, and a dozen Manderly men came cursing to their feet. Some grabbed up knives, platters, flagons, anything that might serve as a weapon.\nSer Hosteen Frey ripped his longsword from its scabbard and leapt toward Wyman Manderly. The Lord of White Harbor tried to jerk away, but the tabletop pinned him to his chair. The blade slashed through three of his four chins in a spray of bright red blood. Lady Walda gave a shriek and clutched at her lord husband\u2019s arm. \u201cStop,\u201d Roose Bolton shouted. \u201cStop this madness.\u201d His own men rushed forward as the Manderlys vaulted over the benches to get at the Freys. One lunged at Ser Hosteen with a dagger, but the big knight pivoted and took his arm off at the shoulder. Lord Wyman pushed to his feet, only to collapse. Old Lord Locke was shouting for a maester as Manderly flopped on the floor like a clubbed walrus in a spreading pool of blood. Around him dogs fought over sausages.\nIt took two score Dreadfort spearmen to part the combatants and put an end to the carnage. By that time six White Harbor men and two Freys lay dead upon the floor. A dozen more were wounded and one of the Bastard\u2019s Boys, Luton, was dying noisily, crying for his mother as he tried to shove a fistful of slimy entrails back through a gaping belly wound. Lord Ramsay silenced him, yanking a spear from one of Steelshanks\u2019s men and driving it down through Luton\u2019s chest. Even then the rafters still rang with shouts and prayers and curses, the shrieks of terrified horses and the growls of Ramsay\u2019s bitches. Steelshanks Walton had to slam the butt of his spear against the floor a dozen times before the hall quieted enough for Roose Bolton to be heard.\n\u201cI see you all want blood,\u201d the Lord of the Dreadfort said. Maester Rhodry stood beside him, a raven on his arm. The bird\u2019s black plumage shone like coal oil in the torchlight. Wet, Theon realized. And in his lordship\u2019s hand, a parchment. That will be wet as well. Dark wings, dark words. \u201cRather than use our swords upon each other, you might try them on Lord Stannis.\u201d Lord Bolton unrolled the parchment. \u201cHis host lies not three days\u2019 ride from here, snowbound and starving, and I for one am tired of waiting on his pleasure. Ser Hosteen, assemble your knights and men-at-arms by the main gates. As you are so eager for battle, you shall strike our first blow. Lord Wyman, gather your White Harbor men by the east gate. They shall go forth as well.\u201d\nHosteen Frey\u2019s sword was red almost to the hilt. Blood spatters speckled his cheeks like freckles. He lowered his blade and said, \u201cAs my lord commands. But after I deliver you the head of Stannis Baratheon, I mean to finish hacking off Lord Lard\u2019s.\u201d\nFour White Harbor knights had formed a ring around Lord Wyman, as Maester Medrick labored over him to staunch his bleeding. \u201cFirst you must needs come through us, ser,\u201d said the eldest of them, a hard-faced greybeard whose bloodstained surcoat showed three silvery mermaids upon a violet field.\n\u201cGladly. One at a time or all at once, it makes no matter.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d roared Lord Ramsay, brandishing his bloody spear. \u201cAnother threat, and I\u2019ll gut you all myself. My lord father has spoken! Save your wroth for the pretender Stannis.\u201d\nRoose Bolton gave an approving nod. \u201cAs he says. There will be time enough to fight each other once we are done with Stannis.\u201d He turned his head, his pale cold eyes searching the hall until they found the bard Abel beside Theon. \u201cSinger,\u201d he called, \u201ccome sing us something soothing.\u201d\nAbel bowed. \u201cIf it please your lordship.\u201d Lute in hand, he sauntered to the dais, hopping nimbly over a corpse or two, and seated himself cross-legged on the high table. As he began to play\u2014a sad, soft song that Theon Greyjoy did not recognize\u2014Ser Hosteen, Ser Aenys, and their fellow Freys turned away to lead their horses from the hall.\nRowan grasped Theon\u2019s arm. \u201cThe bath. It must be now.\u201d\nHe wrenched free of her touch. \u201cBy day? We will be seen.\u201d\n\u201cThe snow will hide us. Are you deaf? Bolton is sending forth his swords. We have to reach King Stannis before they do.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Abel\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAbel can fend for himself,\u201d murmured Squirrel.\nThis is madness. Hopeless, foolish, doomed. Theon drained the last dregs of his ale and rose reluctantly to his feet. \u201cFind your sisters. It takes a deal of water to fill my lady\u2019s tub.\u201d\nSquirrel slipped away, soft-footed as she always was. Rowan walked Theon from the hall. Since she and her sisters had found him in the godswood, one of them had dogged his every step, never letting him out of sight. They did not trust him. Why should they? I was Reek before and might be Reek again. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with sneak.\nOutside the snow still fell. The snowmen the squires had built had grown into monstrous giants, ten feet tall and hideously misshapen. White walls rose to either side as he and Rowan made their way to the godswood; the paths between keep and tower and hall had turned into a maze of icy trenches, shoveled out hourly to keep them clear. It was easy to get lost in that frozen labyrinth, but Theon Greyjoy knew every twist and turning.\nEven the godswood was turning white. A film of ice had formed upon the pool beneath the heart tree, and the face carved into its pale trunk had grown a mustache of little icicles. At this hour they could not hope to have the old gods to themselves. Rowan pulled Theon away from the northmen praying before the tree, to a secluded spot back by the barracks wall, beside a pool of warm mud that stank of rotten eggs. Even the mud was icing up about the edges, Theon saw. \u201cWinter is coming\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nRowan gave him a hard look. \u201cYou have no right to mouth Lord Eddard\u2019s words. Not you. Not ever. After what you did\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou killed a boy as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat was not us. I told you.\u201d\n\u201cWords are wind.\u201d They are no better than me. We\u2019re just the same. \u201cYou killed the others, why not him? Yellow Dick\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014stank as bad as you. A pig of a man.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Little Walder was a piglet. Killing him brought the Freys and Manderlys to dagger points, that was cunning, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot us.\u201d Rowan grabbed him by the throat and shoved him back against the barracks wall, her face an inch from his. \u201cSay it again and I will rip your lying tongue out, kinslayer.\u201d\nHe smiled through his broken teeth. \u201cYou won\u2019t. You need my tongue to get you past the guards. You need my lies.\u201d\nRowan spat in his face. Then she let him go and wiped her gloved hands on her legs, as if just touching him had soiled her.\nTheon knew he should not goad her. In her own way, this one was as dangerous as Skinner or Damon Dance-for-Me. But he was cold and tired, his head was pounding, he had not slept in days. \u201cI have done terrible things\u00a0\u2026\u00a0betrayed my own, turned my cloak, ordered the death of men who trusted me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I am no kinslayer.\u201d\n\u201cStark\u2019s boys were never brothers to you, aye. We know.\u201d\nThat was true, but it was not what Theon had meant. They were not my blood, but even so, I never harmed them. The two we killed were just some miller\u2019s sons. Theon did not want to think about their mother. He had known the miller\u2019s wife for years, had even bedded her. Big heavy breasts with wide dark nipples, a sweet mouth, a merry laugh. Joys that I will never taste again.\nBut there was no use telling Rowan any of that. She would never believe his denials, any more than he believed hers. \u201cThere is blood on my hands, but not the blood of brothers,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been punished.\u201d\n\u201cNot enough.\u201d Rowan turned her back on him.\nFoolish woman. He might well be a broken thing, but Theon still wore a dagger. It would have been a simple thing to slide it out and drive it down between her shoulder blades. That much he was still capable of, missing teeth and broken teeth and all. It might even be a kindness\u2014a quicker, cleaner end than the one she and her sisters would face when Ramsay caught them.\nReek might have done it. Would have done it, in hopes it might please Lord Ramsay. These whores meant to steal Ramsay\u2019s bride; Reek could not allow that. But the old gods had known him, had called him Theon. Ironborn, I was ironborn, Balon Greyjoy\u2019s son and rightful heir to Pyke. The stumps of his fingers itched and twitched, but he kept his dagger in its sheath.\nWhen Squirrel returned, the other four were with her: gaunt grey-haired Myrtle, Willow Witch-Eye with her long black braid, Frenya of the thick waist and enormous breasts, Holly with her knife. Clad as serving girls in layers of drab grey roughspun, they wore brown woolen cloaks lined with white rabbit fur. No swords, Theon saw. No axes, no hammers, no weapons but knives. Holly\u2019s cloak was fastened with a silver clasp, and Frenya had a girdle of hempen rope wound about her middle from her hips to breasts. It made her look even more massive than she was.\nMyrtle had servant\u2019s garb for Rowan. \u201cThe yards are crawling with fools,\u201d she warned them. \u201cThey mean to ride out.\u201d\n\u201cKneelers,\u201d said Willow, with a snort of contempt. \u201cTheir lordly lord spoke, they must obey.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to die,\u201d chirped Holly, happily.\n\u201cThem and us,\u201d said Theon. \u201cEven if we do get past the guards, how do you mean to get Lady Arya out?\u201d\nHolly smiled. \u201cSix women go in, six come out. Who looks at serving girls? We\u2019ll dress the Stark girl up as Squirrel.\u201d\nTheon glanced at Squirrel. They are almost of a size. It might work. \u201cAnd how does Squirrel get out?\u201d\nSquirrel answered for herself. \u201cOut a window, and straight down to the godswood. I was twelve the first time my brother took me raiding south o\u2019 your Wall. That\u2019s where I got my name. My brother said I looked like a squirrel running up a tree. I\u2019ve done that Wall six times since, over and back again. I think I can climb down some stone tower.\u201d\n\u201cHappy, turncloak?\u201d Rowan asked. \u201cLet\u2019s be about it.\u201d\nWinterfell\u2019s cavernous kitchen occupied a building all its own, set well apart from the castle\u2019s main halls and keeps in case of fire. Inside, the smells changed hour by hour\u2014an ever-changing perfume of roast meats, leeks and onions, fresh-baked bread. Roose Bolton had posted guards at the kitchen door. With so many mouths to feed, every scrap of food was precious. Even the cooks and potboys were watched constantly. But the guards knew Reek. They liked to taunt him when he came to fetch hot water for Lady Arya\u2019s bath. None of them dared go further than that, though. Reek was known to be Lord Ramsay\u2019s pet.\n\u201cThe Prince of Stink is come for some hot water,\u201d one guard announced when Theon and his serving girls appeared before him. He pushed the door open for them. \u201cQuick now, before all that sweet warm air escapes.\u201d\nWithin, Theon grabbed a passing potboy by the arm. \u201cHot water for m\u2019lady, boy,\u201d he commanded. \u201cSix pails full, and see that it\u2019s good and hot. Lord Ramsay wants her pink and clean.\u201d\n\u201cAye, m\u2019lord,\u201d the boy said. \u201cAt once, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cAt once\u201d took longer than Theon would have liked. None of the big kettles was clean, so the potboy had to scrub one out before filling it with water. Then it seemed to take forever to come to a rolling boil and twice forever to fill six wooden pails. All the while Abel\u2019s women waited, their faces shadowed by their cowls. They are doing it all wrong. Real serving girls were always teasing the potboys, flirting with the cooks, wheedling a taste of this, a bite of that. Rowan and her scheming sisters did not want to attract notice, but their sullen silence soon had the guards giving them queer looks. \u201cWhere\u2019s Maisie and Jez and t\u2019other girls?\u201d one asked Theon. \u201cThe usual ones.\u201d\n\u201cLady Arya was displeased with them,\u201d he lied. \u201cHer water was cold before it reached the tub last time.\u201d\nThe hot water filled the air with clouds of steam, melting the snowflakes as they came drifting down. Back through the maze of ice-walled trenches went the procession. With every sloshing step the water cooled. The passages were clogged with troops: armored knights in woolen surcoats and fur cloaks, men-at-arms with spears across their shoulders, archers carrying unstrung bows and sheaves of arrows, freeriders, grooms leading warhorses. The Frey men wore the badge of the two towers, those from White Harbor displayed merman and trident. They shouldered through the storm in opposite directions and eyed each other warily as they passed, but no swords were drawn. Not here. It may be different out there in the woods.\nHalf a dozen seasoned Dreadfort men guarded the doors of the Great Keep. \u201cAnother bloody bath?\u201d said their serjeant when he saw the pails of steaming water. He had his hands tucked up into his armpits against the cold. \u201cShe had a bath last night. How dirty can one woman get in her own bed?\u201d\nDirtier than you know, when you share that bed with Ramsay, Theon thought, remembering the wedding night and the things that he and Jeyne had been made to do. \u201cLord Ramsay\u2019s command.\u201d\n\u201cGet in there, then, before the water freezes,\u201d the serjeant said. Two of the guards pushed open the double doors.\nThe entryway was nigh as cold as the air outside. Holly kicked snow from her boots and lowered the hood of her cloak. \u201cI thought that would be harder.\u201d Her breath frosted the air.\n\u201cThere are more guards upstairs at m\u2019lord\u2019s bedchamber,\u201d Theon warned her. \u201cRamsay\u2019s men.\u201d He dare not call them the Bastard\u2019s Boys, not here. You never knew who might be listening. \u201cKeep your heads down and your hoods up.\u201d\n\u201cDo as he says, Holly,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cThere\u2019s some will know your face. We don\u2019t need that trouble.\u201d\nTheon led the way up the stairs. I have climbed these steps a thousand times before. As a boy he would run up; descending, he would take the steps three at a time, leaping. Once he leapt right into Old Nan and knocked her to the floor. That earned him the worst thrashing he ever had at Winterfell, though it was almost tender compared to the beatings his brothers used to give him back on Pyke. He and Robb had fought many a heroic battle on these steps, slashing at one another with wooden swords. Good training, that; it brought home how hard it was to fight your way up a spiral stair against determined opposition. Ser Rodrik liked to say that one good man could hold a hundred, fighting down.\nThat was long ago, though. They were all dead now. Jory, old Ser Rodrik, Lord Eddard, Harwin and Hullen, Cayn and Desmond and Fat Tom, Alyn with his dreams of knighthood, Mikken who had given him his first real sword. Even Old Nan, like as not.\nAnd Robb. Robb who had been more a brother to Theon than any son born of Balon Greyjoy\u2019s loins. Murdered at the Red Wedding, butchered by the Freys. I should have been with him. Where was I? I should have died with him.\nTheon stopped so suddenly that Willow almost plowed into his back. The door to Ramsay\u2019s bedchamber was before him. And guarding it were two of the Bastard\u2019s Boys, Sour Alyn and Grunt.\nThe old gods must wish us well. Grunt had no tongue and Sour Alyn had no wits, Lord Ramsay liked to say. One was brutal, the other mean, but both had spent most of their lives in service at the Dreadfort. They did as they were told.\n\u201cI have hot water for the Lady Arya,\u201d Theon told them.\n\u201cTry a wash yourself, Reek,\u201d said Sour Alyn. \u201cYou smell like horse piss.\u201d Grunt grunted in agreement. Or perhaps that noise was meant to be a laugh. But Alyn unlocked the door to the bedchamber, and Theon waved the women through.\nNo day had dawned inside this room. Shadows covered all. One last log crackled feebly amongst the dying embers in the hearth, and a candle flickered on the table beside a rumpled, empty bed. The girl is gone, Theon thought. She has thrown herself out a window in despair. But the windows here were shuttered against the storm, sealed up by crusts of blown snow and frost. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Holly asked. Her sisters emptied their pails into the big round wooden tub. Frenya shut the chamber door and put her back against it. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Holly said again. Outside a horn was blowing. A trumpet. The Freys, assembling for battle. Theon could feel an itching in his missing fingers.\nThen he saw her. She was huddled in the darkest corner of the bedchamber, on the floor, curled up in a ball beneath a pile of wolfskins. Theon might never have spotted her but for the way she trembled. Jeyne had pulled the furs up over herself to hide. From us? Or was she expecting her lord husband? The thought that Ramsay might be coming made him want to scream. \u201cMy lady.\u201d Theon could not bring himself to call her Arya and dare not call her Jeyne. \u201cNo need to hide. These are friends.\u201d\nThe furs stirred. An eye peered out, shining with tears. Dark, too dark. A brown eye. \u201cTheon?\u201d\n\u201cLady Arya.\u201d Rowan moved closer. \u201cYou must come with us, and quickly. We\u2019ve come to take you to your brother.\u201d\n\u201cBrother?\u201d The girl\u2019s face emerged from underneath the wolfskins. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have no brothers.\u201d\nShe has forgotten who she is. She has forgotten her name. \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Theon, \u201cbut you had brothers once. Three of them. Robb and Bran and Rickon.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead. I have no brothers now.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a half-brother,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cLord Crow, he is.\u201d\n\u201cJon Snow?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take you to him, but you must come at once.\u201d\nJeyne pulled her wolfskins up to her chin. \u201cNo. This is some trick. It\u2019s him, it\u2019s my\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my lord, my sweet lord, he sent you, this is just some test to make sure that I love him. I do, I do, I love him more than anything.\u201d A tear ran down her cheek. \u201cTell him, you tell him. I\u2019ll do what he wants\u00a0\u2026\u00a0whatever he wants\u00a0\u2026\u00a0with him or\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or with the dog or\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he doesn\u2019t need to cut my feet off, I won\u2019t try to run away, not ever, I\u2019ll give him sons, I swear it, I swear it\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nRowan whistled softly. \u201cGods curse the man.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a good girl,\u201d Jeyne whimpered. \u201cThey trained me.\u201d\nWillow scowled. \u201cSomeone stop her crying. That guard was mute, not deaf. They\u2019re going to hear.\u201d\n\u201cGet her up, turncloak.\u201d Holly had her knife in hand. \u201cGet her up or I will. We have to go. Get the little cunt up on her feet and shake some courage into her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if she screams?\u201d said Rowan.\nWe are all dead, Theon thought. I told them this was folly, but none of them would listen. Abel had doomed them. All singers were half-mad. In songs, the hero always saved the maiden from the monster\u2019s castle, but life was not a song, no more than Jeyne was Arya Stark. Her eyes are the wrong color. And there are no heroes here, only whores. Even so, he knelt beside her, pulled down the furs, touched her cheek. \u201cYou know me. I\u2019m Theon, you remember. I know you too. I know your name.\u201d\n\u201cMy name?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMy name\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nHe put a finger to her lips. \u201cWe can talk about that later. You need to be quiet now. Come with us. With me. We will take you away from here. Away from him.\u201d\nHer eyes widened. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, please.\u201d\nTheon slipped his hand through hers. The stumps of his lost fingers tingled as he drew the girl to her feet. The wolfskins fell away from her. Underneath them she was naked, her small pale breasts covered with teeth marks. He heard one of the women suck in her breath. Rowan thrust a bundle of clothes into his hands. \u201cGet her dressed. It\u2019s cold outside.\u201d Squirrel had stripped down to her smallclothes, and was rooting through a carved cedar chest in search of something warmer. In the end she settled for one of Lord Ramsay\u2019s quilted doublets and a well-worn pair of breeches that flapped about her legs like a ship\u2019s sails in a storm.\nWith Rowan\u2019s help, Theon got Jeyne Poole into Squirrel\u2019s clothes. If the gods are good and the guards are blind, she may pass. \u201cNow we are going out and down the steps,\u201d Theon told the girl. \u201cKeep your head down and your hood up. Follow Holly. Don\u2019t run, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t speak, don\u2019t look anyone in the eye.\u201d\n\u201cStay close to me,\u201d Jeyne said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d\n\u201cI will be right beside you,\u201d Theon promised as Squirrel slipped into Lady Arya\u2019s bed and pulled the blanket up.\nFrenya opened the bedchamber door.\n\u201cYou give her a good wash, Reek?\u201d asked Sour Alyn as they emerged. Grunt gave Willow\u2019s breast a squeeze as she went by. They were fortunate in his choice. If the man had touched Jeyne, she might have screamed. Then Holly would have opened his throat for him with the knife hidden up her sleeve. Willow simply twisted away and past him.\nFor a moment Theon felt almost giddy. They never looked. They never saw. We walked the girl right by them!\nBut on the steps the fear returned. What if they met Skinner or Damon Dance-for-Me or Steelshanks Walton? Or Ramsay himself? Gods save me, not Ramsay, anyone but him. What use was it to smuggle the girl out of her bedchamber? They were still inside the castle, with every gate closed and barred and the battlements thick with sentries. Like as not, the guards outside the keep would stop them. Holly and her knife would be of small use against six men in mail with swords and spears.\nBut the guards outside were huddled by the doors, backs turned against the icy wind and blown snow. Even the serjeant did not spare them more than a quick glance. Theon felt a stab of pity for him and his men. Ramsay would flay them all when he learned his bride was gone, and what he would do to Grunt and Sour Alyn did not bear thinking about.\nNot ten yards from the door, Rowan dropped her empty pail, and her sisters did likewise. The Great Keep was already lost to sight behind them. The yard was a white wilderness, full of half-heard sounds that echoed strangely amidst the storm. The icy trenches rose around them, knee high, then waist high, then higher than their heads. They were in the heart of Winterfell with the castle all around them, but no sign of it could be seen. They might have easily been lost amidst the Land of Always Winter, a thousand leagues beyond the Wall. \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Jeyne Poole whimpered as she stumbled along at Theon\u2019s side.\nAnd soon to be colder. Beyond the castle walls, winter was waiting with its icy teeth. If we get that far. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said when they came to a junction where three trenches crossed.\n\u201cFrenya, Holly, go with them,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cWe will be along with Abel. Do not wait for us.\u201d And with that, she whirled and plunged into the snow, toward the Great Hall. Willow and Myrtle hurried after her, cloaks snapping in the wind.\nMadder and madder, thought Theon Greyjoy. Escape had seemed unlikely with all six of Abel\u2019s women; with only two, it seemed impossible. But they had gone too far to return the girl to her bedchamber and pretend none of this had ever happened. Instead he took Jeyne by the arm and drew her down the pathway to the Battlements Gate. Only a halfgate, he reminded himself. Even if the guards let us pass, there is no way through the outer wall. On other nights, the guards had allowed Theon through, but all those times he\u2019d come alone. He would not pass so easily with three serving girls in tow, and if the guards looked beneath Jeyne\u2019s hood and recognized Lord Ramsay\u2019s bride\u00a0\u2026\nThe passage twisted to the left. There before them, behind a veil of falling snow, yawned the Battlements Gate, flanked by a pair of guards. In their wool and fur and leather, they looked as big as bears. The spears they held were eight feet tall. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d one called out. Theon did not recognize the voice. Most of the man\u2019s features were covered by the scarf about his face. Only his eyes could be seen. \u201cReek, is that you?\u201d\nYes, he meant to say. Instead he heard himself reply, \u201cTheon Greyjoy. I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I have brought some women for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou poor boys must be freezing,\u201d said Holly. \u201cHere, let me warm you up.\u201d She slipped past the guard\u2019s spearpoint and reached up to his face, pulling loose the half-frozen scarf to plant a kiss upon his mouth. And as their lips touched, her blade slid through the meat of his neck, just below the ear. Theon saw the man\u2019s eyes widen. There was blood on Holly\u2019s lips as she stepped back, and blood dribbling from his mouth as he fell.\nThe second guard was still gaping in confusion when Frenya grabbed the shaft of his spear. They struggled for a moment, tugging, till the woman wrenched the weapon from his fingers and clouted him across the temple with its butt. As he stumbled backwards, she spun the spear around and drove its point through his belly with a grunt.\nJeyne Poole let out a shrill, high scream.\n\u201cOh, bloody shit,\u201d said Holly. \u201cThat will bring the kneelers down on us, and no mistake. Run!\u201d\nTheon clapped one hand around Jeyne\u2019s mouth, grabbed her about the waist with the other, and pulled her past the dead and dying guards, through the gate, and over the frozen moat. And perhaps the old gods were still watching over them; the drawbridge had been left down, to allow Winterfell\u2019s defenders to cross to and from the outer battlements more quickly. From behind them came alarums and the sounds of running feet, then the blast of a trumpet from the ramparts of the inner wall.\nOn the drawbridge, Frenya stopped and turned. \u201cGo on. I will hold the kneelers here.\u201d The bloody spear was still clutched in her big hands.\nTheon was staggering by the time he reached the foot of the stair. He slung the girl over his shoulder and began to climb. Jeyne had ceased to struggle by then, and she was such a little thing besides\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the steps were slick with ice beneath soft powdery snow, and halfway up he lost his footing and went down hard on one knee. The pain was so bad he almost lost the girl, and for half a heartbeat he feared this was as far as he would go. But Holly pulled him back onto his feet, and between the two of them they finally got Jeyne up to the battlements.\nAs he leaned up against a merlon, breathing hard, Theon could hear the shouting from below, where Frenya was fighting half a dozen guardsmen in the snow. \u201cWhich way?\u201d he shouted at Holly. \u201cWhere do we go now? How do we get out?\u201d\nThe fury on Holly\u2019s face turned to horror. \u201cOh, fuck me bloody. The rope.\u201d She gave a hysterical laugh. \u201cFrenya has the rope.\u201d Then she grunted and grabbed her stomach. A quarrel had sprouted from her gut. When she wrapped a hand around it, blood leaked through her fingers. \u201cKneelers on the inner wall\u00a0\u2026\u201d she gasped, before a second shaft appeared between her breasts. Holly grabbed for the nearest merlon and fell. The snow that she\u2019d knocked loose buried her with a soft thump.\nShouts rang out from their left. Jeyne Poole was staring down at Holly as the snowy blanket over her turned from white to red. On the inner wall the crossbowman would be reloading, Theon knew. He started right, but there were men coming from that direction too, racing toward them with swords in hand. Far off to the north he heard a warhorn sound. Stannis, he thought wildly. Stannis is our only hope, if we can reach him. The wind was howling, and he and the girl were trapped.\nThe crossbow snapped. A bolt passed within a foot of him, shattering the crust of frozen snow that had plugged the closest crenel. Of Abel, Rowan, Squirrel, and the others there was no sign. He and the girl were alone. If they take us alive, they will deliver us to Ramsay.\nTheon grabbed Jeyne about the waist and jumped.",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe sky was a merciless blue, without a wisp of cloud in sight. The bricks will soon be baking in the sun, thought Dany. Down on the sands, the fighters will feel the heat through the soles of their sandals.\nJhiqui slipped Dany\u2019s silk robe from her shoulders and Irri helped her into her bathing pool. The light of the rising sun shimmered on the water, broken by the shadow of the persimmon tree. \u201cEven if the pits must open, must Your Grace go yourself?\u201d asked Missandei as she was washing the queen\u2019s hair.\n\u201cHalf of Meereen will be there to see me, gentle heart.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Missandei, \u201cthis one begs leave to say that half of Meereen will be there to watch men bleed and die.\u201d\nShe is not wrong, the queen knew, but it makes no matter.\nSoon Dany was as clean as she was ever going to be. She pushed herself to her feet, splashing softly. Water ran down her legs and beaded on her breasts. The sun was climbing up the sky, and her people would soon be gathering. She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and dreaming of a house with a red door, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself.\nJhiqui brought a soft towel to pat her dry. \u201cKhaleesi, which tokar will you want today?\u201d asked Irri.\n\u201cThe yellow silk.\u201d The queen of the rabbits could not be seen without her floppy ears. The yellow silk was light and cool, and it would be blistering down in the pit. The red sands will burn the soles of those about to die. \u201cAnd over it, the long red veils.\u201d The veils would keep the wind from blowing sand into her mouth. And the red will hide any blood spatters.\nAs Jhiqui brushed Dany\u2019s hair and Irri painted the queen\u2019s nails, they chattered happily about the day\u2019s matches. Missandei reemerged. \u201cYour Grace. The king bids you join him when you are dressed. And Prince Quentyn has come with his Dornish Men. They beg a word, if that should please you.\u201d\nLittle about this day shall please me. \u201cSome other day.\u201d\nAt the base of the Great Pyramid, Ser Barristan awaited them beside an ornate open palanquin, surrounded by Brazen Beasts. Ser Grandfather, Dany thought. Despite his age, he looked tall and handsome in the armor that she\u2019d given him. \u201cI would be happier if you had Unsullied guards about you today, Your Grace,\u201d the old knight said, as Hizdahr went to greet his cousin. \u201cHalf of these Brazen Beasts are untried freedmen.\u201d And the other half are Meereenese of doubtful loyalty, he left unsaid. Selmy mistrusted all the Meereenese, even shavepates.\n\u201cAnd untried they shall remain unless we try them.\u201d\n\u201cA mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man behind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before? How can we know?\u201d\n\u201cHow should Meereen ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not? There are good brave men beneath those masks. I put my life into their hands.\u201d Dany smiled for him. \u201cYou fret too much, ser. I will have you beside me, what other protection do I need?\u201d\n\u201cI am one old man, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cStrong Belwas will be with me as well.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d Ser Barristan lowered his voice. \u201cYour Grace. We set the woman Meris free, as you commanded. Before she went, she asked to speak with you. I met with her instead. She claims this Tattered Prince meant to bring the Windblown over to your cause from the beginning. That he sent her here to treat with you secretly, but the Dornishmen unmasked them and betrayed them before she could make her own approach.\u201d\nTreachery on treachery, the queen thought wearily. Is there no end to it? \u201cHow much of this do you believe, ser?\u201d\n\u201cLittle and less, Your Grace, but those were her words.\u201d\n\u201cWill they come over to us, if need be?\u201d\n\u201cShe says they will. But for a price.\u201d\n\u201cPay it.\u201d Meereen needed iron, not gold.\n\u201cThe Tattered Prince will want more than coin, Your Grace. Meris says that he wants Pentos.\u201d\n\u201cPentos?\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHow can I give him Pentos? It is half a world away.\u201d\n\u201cHe would be willing to wait, the woman Meris suggested. Until we march for Westeros.\u201d\nAnd if I never march for Westeros? \u201cPentos belongs to the Pentoshi. And Magister Illyrio is in Pentos. He who arranged my marriage to Khal Drogo and gave me my dragon eggs. Who sent me you, and Belwas, and Groleo. I owe him much and more. I will not repay that debt by giving his city to some sellsword. No.\u201d\nSer Barristan inclined his head. \u201cYour Grace is wise.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever seen such an auspicious day, my love?\u201d Hizdahr zo Loraq commented when she rejoined him. He helped Dany up onto the palanquin, where two tall thrones stood side by side.\n\u201cAuspicious for you, perhaps. Less so for those who must die before the sun goes down.\u201d\n\u201cAll men must die,\u201d said Hizdahr, \u201cbut not all can die in glory, with the cheers of the city ringing in their ears.\u201d He lifted a hand to the soldiers on the doors. \u201cOpen.\u201d\nThe plaza that fronted on her pyramid was paved with bricks of many colors, and the heat rose from them in shimmering waves. People swarmed everywhere. Some rode litters or sedan chairs, some forked donkeys, many were afoot. Nine of every ten were moving westward, down the broad brick thoroughfare to Daznak\u2019s Pit. When they caught sight of the palanquin emerging from the pyramid, a cheer went up from those nearest and spread across the plaza. How queer, the queen thought. They cheer me on the same plaza where I once impaled one hundred sixty-three Great Masters.\nA great drum led the royal procession to clear their way through the streets. Between each beat, a shavepate herald in a shirt of polished copper disks cried for the crowd to part. BOMM. \u201cThey come!\u201d BOMM. \u201cMake way!\u201d BOMM. \u201cThe queen!\u201d BOMM. \u201cThe king!\u201d BOMM. Behind the drum marched Brazen Beasts four abreast. Some carried cudgels, others staves; all wore pleated skirts, leathern sandals, and patchwork cloaks sewn from squares of many colors to echo the many-colored bricks of Meereen. Their masks gleamed in the sun: boars and bulls, hawks and herons, lions and tigers and bears, fork-tongued serpents and hideous basilisks.\nStrong Belwas, who had no love for horses, walked in front of them in his studded vest, his scarred brown belly jiggling with every step. Irri and Jhiqui followed ahorse, with Aggo and Rakharo, then Reznak in an ornate sedan chair with an awning to keep the sun off his head. Ser Barristan Selmy rode at Dany\u2019s side, his armor flashing in the sun. A long cloak flowed from his shoulders, bleached as white as bone. On his left arm was a large white shield. A little farther back was Quentyn Martell, the Dornish prince, with his two companions.\nThe column crept slowly down the long brick street. BOMM. \u201cThey come!\u201d BOMM. \u201cOur queen. Our king.\u201d BOMM. \u201cMake way.\u201d\nDany could hear her handmaids arguing behind her, debating who was going to win the day\u2019s final match. Jhiqui favored the gigantic Goghor, who looked more bull than man, even to the bronze ring in his nose. Irri insisted that Belaquo Bonebreaker\u2019s flail would prove the giant\u2019s undoing. My handmaids are Dothraki, she told herself. Death rides with every khalasar. The day she wed Khal Drogo, the arakhs had flashed at her wedding feast, and men had died whilst others drank and mated. Life and death went hand in hand amongst the horselords, and a sprinkling of blood was thought to bless a marriage. Her new marriage would soon be drenched in blood. How blessed it would be.\nBOMM, BOMM, BOMM, BOMM, BOMM, BOMM, came the drumbeats, faster than before, suddenly angry and impatient. Ser Barristan drew his sword as the column ground to an abrupt halt between the pink-and-white pyramid of Pahl and the green-and-black of Naqqan.\nDany turned. \u201cWhy are we stopped?\u201d\nHizdahr stood. \u201cThe way is blocked.\u201d\nA palanquin lay overturned athwart their way. One of its bearers had collapsed to the bricks, overcome by heat. \u201cHelp that man,\u201d Dany commanded. \u201cGet him off the street before he\u2019s stepped on and give him food and water. He looks as though he has not eaten in a fortnight.\u201d\nSer Barristan glanced uneasily to left and right. Ghiscari faces were visible on the terraces, looking down with cool and unsympathetic eyes. \u201cYour Grace, I do not like this halt. This may be some trap. The Sons of the Harpy\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014have been tamed,\u201d declared Hizdahr zo Loraq. \u201cWhy should they seek to harm my queen when she has taken me for her king and consort? Now help that man, as my sweet queen has commanded.\u201d He took Dany by the hand and smiled.\nThe Brazen Beasts did as they were bid. Dany watched them at their work. \u201cThose bearers were slaves before I came. I made them free. Yet that palanquin is no lighter.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Hizdahr, \u201cbut those men are paid to bear its weight now. Before you came, that man who fell would have an overseer standing over him, stripping the skin off his back with a whip. Instead he is being given aid.\u201d\nIt was true. A Brazen Beast in a boar mask had offered the litter bearer a skin of water. \u201cI suppose I must be thankful for small victories,\u201d the queen said.\n\u201cOne step, then the next, and soon we shall be running. Together we shall make a new Meereen.\u201d The street ahead had finally cleared. \u201cShall we continue on?\u201d\nWhat could she do but nod? One step, then the next, but where is it I\u2019m going?\nAt the gates of Daznak\u2019s Pit two towering bronze warriors stood locked in mortal combat. One wielded a sword, the other an axe; the sculptor had depicted them in the act of killing one another, their blades and bodies forming an archway overhead.\nThe mortal art, thought Dany.\nShe had seen the fighting pits many times from her terrace. The small ones dotted the face of Meereen like pockmarks; the larger were weeping sores, red and raw. None compared to this one, though. Strong Belwas and Ser Barristan fell in to either side as she and her lord husband passed beneath the bronzes, to emerge at the top of a great brick bowl ringed by descending tiers of benches, each a different color.\nHizdahr zo Loraq led her down, through black, purple, blue, green, white, yellow, and orange to the red, where the scarlet bricks took the color of the sands below. Around them peddlers were selling dog sausages, roast onions, and unborn puppies on a stick, but Dany had no need of such. Hizdahr had stocked their box with flagons of chilled wine and sweetwater, with figs, dates, melons, and pomegranates, with pecans and peppers and a big bowl of honeyed locusts. Strong Belwas bellowed, \u201cLocusts!\u201d as he seized the bowl and began to crunch them by the handful.\n\u201cThose are very tasty,\u201d advised Hizdahr. \u201cYou ought to try a few yourself, my love. They are rolled in spice before the honey, so they are sweet and hot at once.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains the way Belwas is sweating,\u201d Dany said. \u201cI believe I will content myself with figs and dates.\u201d\nAcross the pit the Graces sat in flowing robes of many colors, clustered around the austere figure of Galazza Galare, who alone amongst them wore the green. The Great Masters of Meereen occupied the red and orange benches. The women were veiled, and the men had brushed and lacquered their hair into horns and hands and spikes. Hizdahr\u2019s kin of the ancient line of Loraq seemed to favor tokars of purple and indigo and lilac, whilst those of Pahl were striped in pink and white. The envoys from Yunkai were all in yellow and filled the box beside the king\u2019s, each of them with his slaves and servants. Meereenese of lesser birth crowded the upper tiers, more distant from the carnage. The black and purple benches, highest and most distant from the sand, were crowded with freedmen and other common folk. The sellswords had been placed up there as well, Daenerys saw, their captains seated right amongst the common soldiers. She spied Brown Ben\u2019s weathered face and Bloodbeard\u2019s fiery red whiskers and long braids.\nHer lord husband stood and raised his hands. \u201cGreat Masters! My queen has come this day, to show her love for you, her people. By her grace and with her leave, I give you now your mortal art. Meereen! Let Queen Daenerys hear your love!\u201d\nTen thousand throats roared out their thanks; then twenty thousand; then all. They did not call her name, which few of them could pronounce. \u201cMother!\u201d they cried instead; in the old dead tongue of Ghis, the word was Mhysa! They stamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, \u201cMhysa, Mhysa, Mhysa,\u201d until the whole pit seemed to tremble. Dany let the sound wash over her. I am not your mother, she might have shouted, back, I am the mother of your slaves, of every boy who ever died upon these sands whilst you gorged on honeyed locusts. Behind her, Reznak leaned in to whisper in her ear, \u201cMagnificence, hear how they love you!\u201d\nNo, she knew, they love their mortal art. When the cheers began to ebb, she allowed to herself to sit. Their box was in the shade, but her head was pounding. \u201cJhiqui,\u201d she called, \u201csweet water, if you would. My throat is very dry.\u201d\n\u201cKhrazz will have the honor of the day\u2019s first kill,\u201d Hizdahr told her. \u201cThere has never been a better fighter.\u201d\n\u201cStrong Belwas was better,\u201d insisted Strong Belwas.\nKhrazz was Meereenese, of humble birth\u2014a tall man with a brush of stiff red-black hair running down the center of his head. His foe was an ebon-skinned spearman from the Summer Isles whose thrusts kept Khrazz at bay for a time, but once he slipped inside the spear with his shortsword, only butchery remained. After it was done, Khrazz cut the heart from the black man, raised it above his head red and dripping, and took a bite from it.\n\u201cKhrazz believes the hearts of brave men make him stronger,\u201d said Hizdahr. Jhiqui murmured her approval. Dany had once eaten a stallion\u2019s heart to give strength to her unborn son\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but that had not saved Rhaego when the maegi murdered him in her womb. Three treasons shall you know. She was the first, Jorah was the second, Brown Ben Plumm the third. Was she done with betrayals?\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hizdahr, pleased. \u201cNow comes the Spotted Cat. See how he moves, my queen. A poem on two feet.\u201d\nThe foe Hizdahr had found for the walking poem was as tall as Goghor and as broad as Belwas, but slow. They were fighting six feet from Dany\u2019s box when the Spotted Cat hamstrung him. As the man stumbled to his knees, the Cat put a foot on his back and a hand around his head and opened his throat from ear to ear. The red sands drank his blood, the wind his final words. The crowd screamed its approval.\n\u201cBad fighting, good dying,\u201d said Strong Belwas. \u201cStrong Belwas hates it when they scream.\u201d He had finished all the honeyed locusts. He gave a belch and took a swig of wine.\nPale Qartheen, black Summer Islanders, copper-skinned Dothraki, Tyroshi with blue beards, Lamb Men, Jogos Nhai, sullen Braavosi, brindle-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\u2014from the ends of the world they came to die in Daznak\u2019s Pit. \u201cThis one shows much promise, my sweet,\u201d Hizdahr said of a Lysene youth with long blond hair that fluttered in the wind\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but his foe grabbed a handful of that hair, pulled the boy off-balance, and gutted him. In death he looked even younger than he had with blade in hand. \u201cA boy,\u201d said Dany. \u201cHe was only a boy.\u201d\n\u201cSix-and-ten,\u201d Hizdahr insisted. \u201cA man grown, who freely chose to risk his life for gold and glory. No children die today in Daznak\u2019s, as my gentle queen in her wisdom has decreed.\u201d\nAnother small victory. Perhaps I cannot make my people good, she told herself, but I should at least try to make them a little less bad. Daenerys would have prohibited contests between women as well, but Barsena Blackhair protested that she had as much right to risk her life as any man. The queen had also wished to forbid the follies, comic combats where cripples, dwarfs, and crones had at one another with cleavers, torches, and hammers (the more inept the fighters, the funnier the folly, it was thought), but Hizdahr said his people would love her more if she laughed with them, and argued that without such frolics, the cripples, dwarfs, and crones would starve. So Dany had relented.\nIt had been the custom to sentence criminals to the pits; that practice she agreed might resume, but only for certain crimes. \u201cMurderers and rapers may be forced to fight, and all those who persist in slaving, but not thieves or debtors.\u201d\nBeasts were still allowed, though. Dany watched an elephant make short work of a pack of six red wolves. Next a bull was set against a bear in a bloody battle that left both animals torn and dying. \u201cThe flesh is not wasted,\u201d said Hizdahr. \u201cThe butchers use the carcasses to make a healthful stew for the hungry. Any man who presents himself at the Gates of Fate may have a bowl.\u201d\n\u201cA good law,\u201d Dany said. You have so few of them. \u201cWe must make certain that this tradition is continued.\u201d\nAfter the beast fights came a mock battle, pitting six men on foot against six horsemen, the former armed with shields and longswords, the latter with Dothraki arakhs. The mock knights were clad in mail hauberks, whilst the mock Dothraki wore no armor. At first the riders seemed to have the advantage, riding down two of their foes and slashing the ear from a third, but then the surviving knights began to attack the horses, and one by one the riders were unmounted and slain, to Jhiqui\u2019s great disgust. \u201cThat was no true khalasar,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThese carcasses are not destined for your healthful stew, I would hope,\u201d Dany said, as the slain were being removed.\n\u201cThe horses, yes,\u201d said Hizdahr. \u201cThe men, no.\u201d\n\u201cHorsemeat and onions makes you strong,\u201d said Belwas.\nThe battle was followed by the day\u2019s first folly, a tilt between a pair of jousting dwarfs, presented by one of the Yunkish lords that Hizdahr had invited to the games. One rode a hound, the other a sow. Their wooden armor had been freshly painted, so one bore the stag of the usurper Robert Baratheon, the other the golden lion of House Lannister. That was for her sake, plainly. Their antics soon had Belwas snorting laughter, though Dany\u2019s smile was faint and forced. When the dwarf in red tumbled from the saddle and began to chase his sow across the sands, whilst the dwarf on the dog galloped after him, whapping at his buttocks with a wooden sword, she said, \u201cThis is sweet and silly, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBe patient, my sweet,\u201d said Hizdahr. \u201cThey are about to loose the lions.\u201d\nDaenerys gave him a quizzical look. \u201cLions?\u201d\n\u201cThree of them. The dwarfs will not expect them.\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cThe dwarfs have wooden swords. Wooden armor. How do you expect them to fight lions?\u201d\n\u201cBadly,\u201d said Hizdahr, \u201cthough perhaps they will surprise us. More like they will shriek and run about and try to climb out of the pit. That is what makes this a folly.\u201d\nDany was not pleased. \u201cI forbid it.\u201d\n\u201cGentle queen. You do not want to disappoint your people.\u201d\n\u201cYou swore to me that the fighters would be grown men who had freely consented to risk their lives for gold and honor. These dwarfs did not consent to battle lions with wooden swords. You will stop it. Now.\u201d\nThe king\u2019s mouth tightened. For a heartbeat Dany thought she saw a flash of anger in those placid eyes. \u201cAs you command.\u201d Hizdahr beckoned to his pitmaster. \u201cNo lions,\u201d he said when the man trotted over, whip in hand.\n\u201cNot one, Magnificence? Where is the fun in that?\u201d\n\u201cMy queen has spoken. The dwarfs will not be harmed.\u201d\n\u201cThe crowd will not like it.\u201d\n\u201cThen bring on Barsena. That should appease them.\u201d\n\u201cYour Worship knows best.\u201d The pitmaster snapped his whip and shouted out commands. The dwarfs were herded off, pig and dog and all, as the spectators hissed their disapproval and pelted them with stones and rotten fruit.\nA roar went up as Barsena Blackhair strode onto the sands, naked save for breechclout and sandals. A tall, dark woman of some thirty years, she moved with the feral grace of a panther. \u201cBarsena is much loved,\u201d Hizdahr said, as the sound swelled to fill the pit. \u201cThe bravest woman I have ever seen.\u201d\nStrong Belwas said, \u201cFighting girls is not so brave. Fighting Strong Belwas would be brave.\u201d\n\u201cToday she fights a boar,\u201d said Hizdahr.\nAye, thought Dany, because you could not find a woman to face her, no matter how plump the purse. \u201cAnd not with a wooden sword, it would seem.\u201d\nThe boar was a huge beast, with tusks as long as a man\u2019s forearm and small eyes that swam with rage. She wondered whether the boar that had killed Robert Baratheon had looked as fierce. A terrible creature and a terrible death. For a heartbeat she felt almost sorry for the Usurper.\n\u201cBarsena is very quick,\u201d Reznak said. \u201cShe will dance with the boar, Magnificence, and slice him when he passes near her. He will be awash in blood before he falls, you shall see.\u201d\nIt began just as he said. The boar charged, Barsena spun aside, her blade flashed silver in the sun. \u201cShe needs a spear,\u201d Ser Barristan said, as Barsena vaulted over the beast\u2019s second charge. \u201cThat is no way to fight a boar.\u201d He sounded like someone\u2019s fussy old grandsire, just as Daario was always saying.\nBarsena\u2019s blade was running red, but the boar soon stopped. He is smarter than a bull, Dany realized. He will not charge again. Barsena came to the same realization. Shouting, she edged closer to the boar, tossing her knife from hand to hand. When the beast backed away, she cursed and slashed at his snout, trying to provoke him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and succeeding. This time her leap came an instant too late, and a tusk ripped her left leg open from knee to crotch.\nA moan went up from thirty thousand throats. Clutching at her torn leg, Barsena dropped her knife and tried to hobble off, but before she had gone two feet the boar was on her once again. Dany turned her face away. \u201cWas that brave enough?\u201d she asked Strong Belwas, as a scream rang out across the sand.\n\u201cFighting pigs is brave, but it is not brave to scream so loud. It hurts Strong Belwas in the ears.\u201d The eunuch rubbed his swollen stomach, crisscrossed with old white scars. \u201cIt makes Strong Belwas sick in his belly too.\u201d\nThe boar buried his snout in Barsena\u2019s belly and began rooting out her entrails. The smell was more than the queen could stand. The heat, the flies, the shouts from the crowd \u00a0\u2026\u00a0I cannot breathe. She lifted her veil and let it flutter away. She took her tokar off as well. The pearls rattled softly against one another as she unwound the silk.\n\u201cKhaleesi?\u201d Irri asked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cTaking off my floppy ears.\u201d A dozen men with boar spears came trotting out onto the sand to drive the boar away from the corpse and back to his pen. The pitmaster was with them, a long barbed whip in his hand. As he snapped it at the boar, the queen rose. \u201cSer Barristan, will you see me safely back to my garden?\u201d\nHizdahr looked confused. \u201cThere is more to come. A folly, six old women, and three more matches. Belaquo and Goghor!\u201d\n\u201cBelaquo will win,\u201d Irri declared. \u201cIt is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not known,\u201d Jhiqui said. \u201cBelaquo will die.\u201d\n\u201cOne will die, or the other will,\u201d said Dany. \u201cAnd the one who lives will die some other day. This was a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cStrong Belwas ate too many locusts.\u201d There was a queasy look on Belwas\u2019s broad brown face. \u201cStrong Belwas needs milk.\u201d\nHizdahr ignored the eunuch. \u201cMagnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our union. You heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this abbatoir, husband.\u201d She could hear the boar snorting, the shouts of the spearmen, the crack of the pitmaster\u2019s whip.\n\u201cSweet lady, no. Stay only a while longer. For the folly, and one last match. Close your eyes, no one will see. They will be watching Belaquo and Ghogor. This is no time for\u2014\u201d\nA shadow rippled across his face.\nThe tumult and the shouting died. Ten thousand voices stilled. Every eye turned skyward. A warm wind brushed Dany\u2019s cheeks, and above the beating of her heart she heard the sound of wings. Two spearmen dashed for shelter. The pitmaster froze where he stood. The boar went snuffling back to Barsena. Strong Belwas gave a moan, stumbled from his seat, and fell to his knees.\nAbove them all the dragon turned, dark against the sun. His scales were black, his eyes and horns and spinal plates blood red. Ever the largest of her three, in the wild Drogon had grown larger still. His wings stretched twenty feet from tip to tip, black as jet. He flapped them once as he swept back above the sands, and the sound was like a clap of thunder. The boar raised his head, snorting\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and flame engulfed him, black fire shot with red. Dany felt the wash of heat thirty feet away. The beast\u2019s dying scream sounded almost human. Drogon landed on the carcass and sank his claws into the smoking flesh. As he began to feed, he made no distinction between Barsena and the boar.\n\u201cOh, gods,\u201d moaned Reznak, \u201che\u2019s eating her!\u201d The seneschal covered his mouth. Strong Belwas was retching noisily. A queer look passed across Hizdahr zo Loraq\u2019s long, pale face\u2014part fear, part lust, part rapture. He licked his lips. Dany could see the Pahls streaming up the steps, clutching their tokars and tripping over the fringes in their haste to be away. Others followed. Some ran, shoving at one another. More stayed in their seats.\nOne man took it on himself to be a hero.\nHe was one of the spearmen sent out to drive the boar back to his pen. Perhaps he was drunk, or mad. Perhaps he had loved Barsena Blackhair from afar or had heard some whisper of the girl Hazzea. Perhaps he was just some common man who wanted bards to sing of him. He darted forward, his boar spear in his hands. Red sand kicked up beneath his heels, and shouts rang out from the seats. Drogon raised his head, blood dripping from his teeth. The hero leapt onto his back and drove the iron spearpoint down at the base of the dragon\u2019s long scaled neck.\nDany and Drogon screamed as one.\nThe hero leaned into his spear, using his weight to twist the point in deeper. Drogon arched upward with a hiss of pain. His tail lashed sideways. She watched his head crane around at the end of that long serpentine neck, saw his black wings unfold. The dragonslayer lost his footing and went tumbling to the sand. He was trying to struggle back to his feet when the dragon\u2019s teeth closed hard around his forearm. \u201cNo\u201d was all the man had time to shout. Drogon wrenched his arm from his shoulder and tossed it aside as a dog might toss a rodent in a rat pit.\n\u201cKill it,\u201d Hizdahr zo Loraq shouted to the other spearmen. \u201cKill the beast!\u201d\nSer Barristan held her tightly. \u201cLook away, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Dany twisted from his grasp. The world seemed to slow as she cleared the parapet. When she landed in the pit she lost a sandal. Running, she could feel the sand between her toes, hot and rough. Ser Barristan was calling after her. Strong Belwas was still vomiting. She ran faster.\nThe spearmen were running too. Some were rushing toward the dragon, spears in hand. Others were rushing away, throwing down their weapons as they fled. The hero was jerking on the sand, the bright blood pouring from the ragged stump of his shoulder. His spear remained in Drogon\u2019s back, wobbling as the dragon beat his wings. Smoke rose from the wound. As the other spears closed in, the dragon spat fire, bathing two men in black flame. His tail lashed sideways and caught the pitmaster creeping up behind him, breaking him in two. Another attacker stabbed at his eyes until the dragon caught him in his jaws and tore his belly out. The Meereenese were screaming, cursing, howling. Dany could hear someone pounding after her. \u201cDrogon,\u201d she screamed. \u201cDrogon.\u201d\nHis head turned. Smoke rose between his teeth. His blood was smoking too, where it dripped upon the ground. He beat his wings again, sending up a choking storm of scarlet sand. Dany stumbled into the hot red cloud, coughing. He snapped.\n\u201cNo\u201d was all that she had time to say. No, not me, don\u2019t you know me? The black teeth closed inches from her face. He meant to tear my head off. The sand was in her eyes. She stumbled over the pitmaster\u2019s corpse and fell on her backside.\nDrogon roared. The sound filled the pit. A furnace wind engulfed her. The dragon\u2019s long scaled neck stretched toward her. When his mouth opened, she could see bits of broken bone and charred flesh between his black teeth. His eyes were molten. I am looking into hell, but I dare not look away. She had never been so certain of anything. If I run from him, he will burn me and devour me. In Westeros the septons spoke of seven hells and seven heavens, but the Seven Kingdoms and their gods were far away. If she died here, Dany wondered, would the horse god of the Dothraki part the grass and claim her for his starry khalasar, so she might ride the nightlands beside her sun-and-stars? Or would the angry gods of Ghis send their harpies to seize her soul and drag her down to torment? Drogon roared full in her face, his breath hot enough to blister skin. Off to her right Dany heard Barristan Selmy shouting, \u201cMe! Try me. Over here. Me!\u201d\nIn the smoldering red pits of Drogon\u2019s eyes, Dany saw her own reflection. How small she looked, how weak and frail and scared. I cannot let him see my fear. She scrabbled in the sand, pushing against the pitmaster\u2019s corpse, and her fingers brushed against the handle of his whip. Touching it made her feel braver. The leather was warm, alive. Drogon roared again, the sound so loud that she almost dropped the whip. His teeth snapped at her.\nDany hit him. \u201cNo,\u201d she screamed, swinging the lash with all the strength that she had in her. The dragon jerked his head back. \u201cNo,\u201d she screamed again. \u201cNO!\u201d The barbs raked along his snout. Drogon rose, his wings covering her in shadow. Dany swung the lash at his scaled belly, back and forth until her arm began to ache. His long serpentine neck bent like an archer\u2019s bow. With a hisssssss, he spat black fire down at her. Dany darted underneath the flames, swinging the whip and shouting, \u201cNo, no, no. Get DOWN!\u201d His answering roar was full of fear and fury, full of pain. His wings beat once, twice\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and folded. The dragon gave one last hiss and stretched out flat upon his belly. Black blood was flowing from the wound where the spear had pierced him, smoking where it dripped onto the scorched sands. He is fire made flesh, she thought, and so am I.\nDaenerys Targaryen vaulted onto the dragon\u2019s back, seized the spear, and ripped it out. The point was half-melted, the iron red-hot, glowing. She flung it aside. Drogon twisted under her, his muscles rippling as he gathered his strength. The air was thick with sand. Dany could not see, she could not breathe, she could not think. The black wings cracked like thunder, and suddenly the scarlet sands were falling away beneath her.\nDizzy, Dany closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she glimpsed the Meereenese beneath her through a haze of tears and dust, pouring up the steps and out into the streets.\nThe lash was still in her hand. She flicked it against Drogon\u2019s neck and cried, \u201cHigher!\u201d Her other hand clutched at his scales, her fingers scrabbling for purchase. Drogon\u2019s wide black wings beat the air. Dany could feel the heat of him between her thighs. Her heart felt as if it were about to burst. Yes, she thought, yes, now, now, do it, do it, take me, take me, FLY!",

      "content": "JON\nHe was not a tall man, Tormund Giantsbane, but the gods had given him a broad chest and massive belly. Mance Rayder had named him Tormund Horn-Blower for the power of his lungs, and was wont to say that Tormund could laugh the snow off mountaintops. In his wroth, his bellows reminded Jon of a mammoth trumpeting.\nThat day Tormund bellowed often and loudly. He roared, he shouted, he slammed his fist against the table so hard that a flagon of water overturned and spilled. A horn of mead was never far from his hand, so the spittle he sprayed when making threats was sweet with honey. He called Jon Snow a craven, a liar, and a turncloak, cursed him for a black-hearted buggering kneeler, a robber, and a carrion crow, accused him of wanting to fuck the free folk up the arse. Twice he flung his drinking horn at Jon\u2019s head, though only after he had emptied it. Tormund was not the sort of man to waste good mead. Jon let it all wash over him. He never raised his own voice nor answered threat with threat, but neither did he give more ground than he had come prepared to give.\nFinally, as the shadows of the afternoon grew long outside the tent, Tormund Giantsbane\u2014Tall-Talker, Horn-Blower, and Breaker of Ice, Tormund Thunderfist, Husband to Bears, Mead-King of Ruddy Hall, Speaker to Gods and Father of Hosts\u2014thrust out his hand. \u201cDone then, and may the gods forgive me. There\u2019s a hundred mothers never will, I know.\u201d\nJon clasped the offered hand. The words of his oath rang through his head. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. And for him a new refrain: I am the guard who opened the gates and let the foe march through. He would have given much and more to know that he was doing the right thing. But he had gone too far to turn back. \u201cDone and done,\u201d he said.\nTormund\u2019s grip was bone-crushing. That much had not changed about him. The beard was the same as well, though the face under that thicket of white hair had thinned considerably, and there were deep lines graven in those ruddy cheeks. \u201cMance should have killed you when he had the chance,\u201d he said as he did his best to turn Jon\u2019s hand to pulp and bone. \u201cGold for gruel, and boys\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a cruel price. Whatever happened to that sweet lad I knew?\u201d\nThey made him lord commander. \u201cA fair bargain leaves both sides unhappy, I\u2019ve heard it said. Three days?\u201d\n\u201cIf I live that long. Some o\u2019 my own will spit on me when they hear these terms.\u201d Tormund released Jon\u2019s hand. \u201cYour crows will grumble too, if I know them. And I ought to. I have killed more o\u2019 you black buggers than I can count.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be best if you did not mention that so loudly when you come south of the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cHar!\u201d Tormund laughed. That had not changed either; he still laughed easily and often. \u201cWise words. I\u2019d not want you crows to peck me to death.\u201d He slapped Jon\u2019s back. \u201cWhen all my folk are safe behind your Wall, we\u2019ll share a bit o\u2019 meat and mead. Till then\u00a0\u2026\u201d The wildling pulled off the band from his left arm and tossed it at Jon, then did the same with its twin upon his right. \u201cYour first payment. Had those from my father and him from his. Now they\u2019re yours, you thieving black bastard.\u201d\nThe armbands were old gold, solid and heavy, engraved with the ancient runes of the First Men. Tormund Giantsbane had worn them as long as Jon had known him; they had seemed as much a part of him as his beard. \u201cThe Braavosi will melt these down for the gold. That seems a shame. Perhaps you ought to keep them.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll not have it said that Tormund Thunderfist made the free folk give up their treasures whilst he kept his own.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut I\u2019ll keep the ring I wear about me member. Much bigger than those little things. On you it\u2019d be a torque.\u201d\nJon had to laugh. \u201cYou never change.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I do.\u201d The grin melted away like snow in summer. \u201cI am not the man I was at Ruddy Hall. Seen too much death, and worse things too. My sons\u00a0\u2026\u201d Grief twisted Tormund\u2019s face. \u201cDormund was cut down in the battle for the Wall, and him still half a boy. One o\u2019 your king\u2019s knights did for him, some bastard all in grey steel with moths upon his shield. I saw the cut, but my boy was dead before I reached him. And Torwynd\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it was the cold claimed him. Always sickly, that one. He just up and died one night. The worst o\u2019 it, before we ever knew he\u2019d died he rose pale with them blue eyes. Had to see to him m\u2019self. That was hard, Jon.\u201d Tears shone in his eyes. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t much of a man, truth be told, but he\u2019d been me little boy once, and I loved him.\u201d\nJon put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Weren\u2019t your doing. There\u2019s blood on your hands, aye, same as mine. But not his.\u201d Tormund shook his head. \u201cI still have two strong sons.\u201d\n\u201cYour daughter \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cMunda.\u201d That brought Tormund\u2019s smile back. \u201cTook that Longspear Ryk to husband, if you believe it. Boy\u2019s got more cock than sense, you ask me, but he treats her well enough. I told him if he ever hurt her, I\u2019d yank his member off and beat him bloody with it.\u201d He gave Jon another hearty slap. \u201cTime you were going back. Keep you any longer, they\u2019re like to think we ate you.\u201d\n\u201cDawn, then. Three days from now. The boys first.\u201d\n\u201cI heard you the first ten times, crow. A man\u2019d think there was no trust between us.\u201d He spat. \u201cBoys first, aye. Mammoths go the long way round. You make sure Eastwatch expects them. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no fighting, nor rushing at your bloody gate. Nice and orderly we\u2019ll be, ducklings in a row. And me the mother duck. Har!\u201d Tormund led Jon from his tent.\nOutside the day was bright and cloudless. The sun had returned to the sky after a fortnight\u2019s absence, and to the south the Wall rose blue-white and glittering. There was a saying Jon had heard from the older men at Castle Black: the Wall has more moods than Mad King Aerys, they\u2019d say, or sometimes, the Wall has more moods than a woman. On cloudy days it looked to be white rock. On moonless nights it was as black as coal. In snowstorms it seemed carved of snow. But on days like this, there was no mistaking it for anything but ice. On days like this the Wall shimmered bright as a septon\u2019s crystal, every crack and crevasse limned by sunlight, as frozen rainbows danced and died behind translucent ripples. On days like this the Wall was beautiful.\nTormund\u2019s eldest son stood near the horses, talking with Leathers. Tall Toregg, he was called amongst the free folk. Though he barely had an inch on Leathers, he overtopped his father by a foot. Hareth, the strapping Mole\u2019s Town boy called Horse, huddled near the fire, his back to the other two. He and Leathers were the only men Jon had brought with him to the parley; any more might have been seen as a sign of fear, and twenty men would have been of no more use than two if Tormund had been intent on blood. Ghost was the only protection Jon needed; the direwolf could sniff out foes, even those who hid their enmity behind smiles.\nGhost was gone, though. Jon peeled off one black glove, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled. \u201cGhost! To me.\u201d\nFrom above came the sudden sound of wings. Mormont\u2019s raven flapped from a limb of an old oak to perch upon Jon\u2019s saddle. \u201cCorn,\u201d it cried. \u201cCorn, corn, corn.\u201d\n\u201cDid you follow me as well?\u201d Jon reached to shoo the bird away but ended up stroking its feathers. The raven cocked its eye at him. \u201cSnow,\u201d it muttered, bobbing its head knowingly. Then Ghost emerged from between two trees, with Val beside him.\nThey look as though they belong together. Val was clad all in white; white woolen breeches tucked into high boots of bleached white leather, white bearskin cloak pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, white tunic with bone fastenings. Her breath was white as well\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but her eyes were blue, her long braid the color of dark honey, her cheeks flushed red from the cold. It had been a long while since Jon Snow had seen a sight so lovely.\n\u201cHave you been trying to steal my wolf?\u201d he asked her.\n\u201cWhy not? If every woman had a direwolf, men would be much sweeter. Even crows.\u201d\n\u201cHar!\u201d laughed Tormund Giantsbane. \u201cDon\u2019t bandy words with this one, Lord Snow, she\u2019s too clever for the likes o\u2019 you and me. Best steal her quick, before Toregg wakes up and takes her first.\u201d\nWhat had that oaf Axell Florent said of Val? \u201cA nubile girl, not hard to look upon. Good hips, good breasts, well made for whelping children.\u201d All true enough, but the wildling woman was so much more. She had proved that by finding Tormund where seasoned rangers of the Watch had failed. She may not be a princess, but she would make a worthy wife for any lord.\nBut that bridge had been burned a long time ago, and Jon himself had thrown the torch. \u201cToregg is welcome to her,\u201d he announced. \u201cI took a vow.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t mind. Will you, girl?\u201d\nVal patted the long bone knife on her hip. \u201cLord Crow is welcome to steal into my bed any night he dares. Once he\u2019s been gelded, keeping those vows will come much easier for him.\u201d\n\u201cHar!\u201d Tormund snorted again. \u201cYou hear that, Toregg? Stay away from this one. I have one daughter, don\u2019t need another.\u201d Shaking his head, the wildling chief ducked back inside his tent.\nAs Jon scratched Ghost behind the ear, Toregg brought up Val\u2019s horse for her. She still rode the grey garron that Mully had given her the day she left the Wall, a shaggy, stunted thing blind in one eye. As she turned it toward the Wall, she asked, \u201cHow fares the little monster?\u201d\n\u201cTwice as big as when you left us, and thrice as loud. When he wants the teat, you can hear him wail in Eastwatch.\u201d Jon mounted his own horse.\nVal fell in beside him. \u201cSo\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I brought you Tormund, as I said I would. What now? Am I to be returned to my old cell?\u201d\n\u201cYour old cell is occupied. Queen Selyse has claimed the King\u2019s Tower, for her own. Do you remember Hardin\u2019s Tower?\u201d\n\u201cThe one that looks about to collapse?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s looked that way for a hundred years. I\u2019ve had the top floor made ready for you, my lady. You will have more room than in the King\u2019s Tower, though you may not be as comfortable. No one has ever called it Hardin\u2019s Palace.\u201d\n\u201cI would choose freedom over comfort every time.\u201d\n\u201cFreedom of the castle you shall have, but I regret to say you must remain a captive. I can promise that you will not be troubled by unwanted visitors, however. My own men guard Hardin\u2019s Tower, not the queen\u2019s. And Wun Wun sleeps in the entry hall.\u201d\n\u201cA giant as protector? Even Dalla could not boast of that.\u201d\nTormund\u2019s wildlings watched them pass, peering out from tents and lean-tos beneath leafless trees. For every man of fighting age, Jon saw three women and as many children, gaunt-faced things with hollow cheeks and staring eyes. When Mance Rayder had led the free folk down upon the Wall, his followers drove large herds of sheep and goats and swine before them, but now the only animals to be seen were the mammoths. If not for the ferocity of the giants, those would have been slaughtered too, he did not doubt. There was a lot of meat on a mammoth\u2019s bones.\nJon saw signs of sickness too. That disquieted him more than he could say. If Tormund\u2019s band were starved and sick, what of the thousands who had followed Mother Mole to Hardhome? Cotter Pyke should reach them soon. If the winds were kind, his fleet might well be on its way back to Eastwatch even now, with as many of the free folk as he could cram aboard.\n\u201cHow did you fare with Tormund?\u201d asked Val.\n\u201cAsk me a year from now. The hard part still awaits me. The part where I convince mine own to eat this meal I\u2019ve cooked for them. None of them are going to like the taste, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cLet me help.\u201d\n\u201cYou have. You brought me Tormund.\u201d\n\u201cI can do more.\u201d\nWhy not? thought Jon. They are all convinced she is a princess. Val looked the part and rode as if she had been born on horseback. A warrior princess, he decided, not some willowy creature who sits up in a tower, brushing her hair and waiting for some knight to rescue her. \u201cI must inform the queen of this agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are welcome to come meet her, if you can find it in yourself to bend a knee.\u201d It would never do to offend Her Grace before he even opened his mouth.\n\u201cMay I laugh when I kneel?\u201d\n\u201cYou may not. This is no game. A river of blood runs between our peoples, old and deep and red. Stannis Baratheon is one of the few who favors admitting wildlings to the realm. I need his queen\u2019s support for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\nVal\u2019s playful smile died. \u201cYou have my word, Lord Snow. I will be a proper wildling princess for your queen.\u201d\nShe is not my queen, he might have said. If truth be told, the day of her departure cannot come too fast for me. And if the gods are good, she will take Melisandre with her.\nThey rode the rest of the way in silence, Ghost loping at their heels. Mormont\u2019s raven followed them as far as the gate, then flapped upward as the rest of them dismounted. Horse went ahead with a brand to light the way through the icy tunnel.\nA small crowd of black brothers was waiting by the gate when Jon and his companions emerged south of the Wall. Ulmer of the Kingswood was amongst them, and it was the old archer who came forward to speak for the rest. \u201cIf it please m\u2019lord, the lads were wondering. Will it be peace, m\u2019lord? Or blood and iron?\u201d\n\u201cPeace,\u201d Jon Snow replied. \u201cThree days hence, Tormund Giantsbane will lead his people through the Wall. As friends, not foes. Some may even swell our ranks, as brothers. It will be for us to make them welcome. Now back to your duties.\u201d Jon handed the reins of his horse to Satin. \u201cI must see Queen Selyse.\u201d Her Grace would take it as a slight if he did not come to her at once. \u201cAfterward I will have letters to write. Bring parchment, quills, and a pot of maester\u2019s black to my chambers. Then summon Marsh, Yarwyck, Septon Cellador, Clydas.\u201d Cellador would be half-drunk, and Clydas was a poor substitute for a real maester, but they were what he had. Till Sam returns. \u201cThe northmen too. Flint and Norrey. Leathers, you should be there as well.\u201d\n\u201cHobb is baking onion pies,\u201d said Satin. \u201cShall I request that they all join you for supper?\u201d\nJon considered. \u201cNo. Ask them to join me atop the Wall at sunset.\u201d He turned to Val. \u201cMy lady. With me, if you please.\u201d\n\u201cThe crow commands, the captive must obey.\u201d Her tone was playful. \u201cThis queen of yours must be fierce if the legs of grown men give out beneath them when they meet her. Should I have dressed in mail instead of wool and fur? These clothes were given to me by Dalla, I would sooner not get bloodstains all over them.\u201d\n\u201cIf words drew blood, you might have cause to fear. I think your clothes are safe enough, my lady.\u201d\nThey made their way toward the King\u2019s Tower, along fresh-shoveled pathways between mounds of dirty snow. \u201cI have heard it said that your queen has a great dark beard.\u201d\nJon knew he should not smile, but he did. \u201cOnly a mustache. Very wispy. You can count the hairs.\u201d\n\u201cHow disappointing.\u201d\nFor all her talk about wanting to be mistress of her seat, Selyse Baratheon seemed in no great haste to abandon the comforts of Castle Black for the shadows of the Nightfort. She kept guards, of course\u2014four men posted at the door, two outside on the steps, two inside by the brazier. Commanding them was Ser Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain, clad in his knightly raiment of white and blue and silver, his cloak a spatter of five-pointed stars. When presented to Val, the knight sank to one knee to kiss her glove. \u201cYou are even lovelier than I was told, princess,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe queen has told me much and more of your beauty.\u201d\n\u201cHow odd, when she has never seen me.\u201d Val patted Ser Patrek on the head. \u201cUp with you now, ser kneeler. Up, up.\u201d She sounded as if she were talking to a dog.\nIt was all that Jon could do not to laugh. Stone-faced, he told the knight that they required audience with the queen. Ser Patrek sent one of the men-at-arms scrambling up the steps to inquire as to whether Her Grace would receive them. \u201cThe wolf stays here, though,\u201d Ser Patrek insisted.\nJon had expected that. The direwolf made Queen Selyse anxious, almost as much as Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun. \u201cGhost, stay.\u201d\nThey found Her Grace sewing by the fire, whilst her fool danced about to music only he could hear, the cowbells on his antlers clanging. \u201cThe crow, the crow,\u201d Patchface cried when he saw Jon. \u201cUnder the sea the crows are white as snow, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d Princess Shireen was curled up in a window seat, her hood drawn up to hide the worst of the greyscale that had disfigured her face.\nThere was no sign of Lady Melisandre. For that much Jon was grateful. Soon or late he would need to face the red priestess, but he would sooner it was not in the queen\u2019s presence. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d He took a knee. Val did likewise.\nQueen Selyse set aside her sewing. \u201cYou may rise.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please Your Grace, may I present the Lady Val? Her sister Dalla was\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014mother to that squalling babe who keeps us awake at night. I know who she is, Lord Snow.\u201d The queen sniffed. \u201cYou are fortunate that she returned to us before the king my husband, else it might have gone badly for you. Very badly indeed.\u201d\n\u201cAre you the wildling princess?\u201d Shireen asked Val.\n\u201cSome call me that,\u201d said Val. \u201cMy sister was wife to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall. She died giving him a son.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a princess too,\u201d Shireen announced, \u201cbut I never had a sister. I used to have a cousin once, before he sailed away. He was just a bastard, but I liked him.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, Shireen,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI am sure the lord commander did not come to hear about Robert\u2019s by-blows. Patchface, be a good fool and take the princess to her room.\u201d\nThe bells on his hat rang. \u201cAway, away,\u201d the fool sang. \u201cCome with me beneath the sea, away, away, away.\u201d He took the little princess by one hand and drew her from the room, skipping.\nJon said, \u201cYour Grace, the leader of the free folk has agreed to my terms.\u201d\nQueen Selyse gave the tiniest of nods. \u201cIt was ever my lord husband\u2019s wish to grant sanctuary to these savage peoples. So long as they keep the king\u2019s peace and the king\u2019s laws, they are welcome in our realm.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cI am told they have more giants with them.\u201d\nVal answered. \u201cAlmost two hundred of them, Your Grace. And more than eighty mammoths.\u201d\nThe queen shuddered. \u201cDreadful creatures.\u201d Jon could not tell if she was speaking of the mammoths or the giants. \u201cThough such beasts might be useful to my lord husband in his battles.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be, Your Grace,\u201d Jon said, \u201cbut the mammoths are too big to pass through our gate.\u201d\n\u201cCannot the gate be widened?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that would be unwise, I think.\u201d\nSelyse sniffed. \u201cIf you say so. No doubt you know about such things. Where do you mean to settle these wildlings? Surely Mole\u2019s Town is not large enough to contain\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how many are they?\u201d\n\u201cFour thousand, Your Grace. They will help us garrison our abandoned castles, the better to defend the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cI had been given to understand that those castles were ruins. Dismal places, bleak and cold, hardly more than heaps of rubble. At Eastwatch we heard talk of rats and spiders.\u201d\nThe cold will have killed the spiders by now, thought Jon, and the rats may be a useful source of meat come winter. \u201cAll true, Your Grace\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but even ruins offer some shelter. And the Wall will stand between them and the Others.\u201d\n\u201cI see you have considered all this carefully, Lord Snow. I am sure King Stannis will be pleased when he returns triumphant from his battle.\u201d\nAssuming he returns at all.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the queen went on, \u201cthe wildlings must first acknowledge Stannis as their king and R\u2019hllor as their god.\u201d\nAnd here we are, face-to-face in the narrow passage. \u201cYour Grace, forgive me. Those were not the terms that we agreed to.\u201d\nThe queen\u2019s face hardened. \u201cA grievous oversight.\u201d What faint traces of warmth her voice had held vanished all at once.\n\u201cFree folk do not kneel,\u201d Val told her.\n\u201cThen they must be knelt,\u201d the queen declared.\n\u201cDo that, Your Grace, and we will rise again at the first chance,\u201d Val promised. \u201cRise with blades in hand.\u201d\nThe queen\u2019s lips tightened, and her chin gave a small quiver. \u201cYou are insolent. I suppose that is only to be expected of a wildling. We must find you a husband who can teach you courtesy.\u201d The queen turned her glare on Jon. \u201cI do not approve, Lord Commander. Nor will my lord husband. I cannot prevent you from opening your gate, as we both know full well, but I promise you that you shall answer for it when the king returns from battle. Mayhaps you might want to reconsider.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Jon knelt again. This time Val did not join him. \u201cI am sorry my actions have displeased you. I did as I thought best. Do I have your leave to go?\u201d\n\u201cYou do. At once.\u201d\nOnce outside and well away from the queen\u2019s men, Val gave vent to her wroth. \u201cYou lied about her beard. That one has more hair on her chin than I have between my legs. And the daughter\u00a0\u2026\u00a0her face\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGreyscale.\u201d\n\u201cThe grey death is what we call it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not always mortal in children.\u201d\n\u201cNorth of the Wall it is. Hemlock is a sure cure, but a pillow or a blade will work as well. If I had given birth to that poor child, I would have given her the gift of mercy long ago.\u201d\nThis was a Val that Jon had never seen before. \u201cPrincess Shireen is the queen\u2019s only child.\u201d\n\u201cI pity both of them. The child is not clean.\u201d\n\u201cIf Stannis wins his war, Shireen will stand as heir to the Iron Throne.\u201d\n\u201cThen I pity your Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\n\u201cThe maesters say greyscale is not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe maesters may believe what they wish. Ask a woods witch if you would know the truth. The grey death sleeps, only to wake again. The child is not clean!\u201d\n\u201cShe seems a sweet girl. You cannot know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can. You know nothing, Jon Snow.\u201d Val seized his arm. \u201cI want the monster out of there. Him and his wet nurses. You cannot leave them in that same tower as the dead girl.\u201d\nJon shook her hand away. \u201cShe is not dead.\u201d\n\u201cShe is. Her mother cannot see it. Nor you, it seems. Yet death is there.\u201d She walked away from him, stopped, turned back. \u201cI brought you Tormund Giantsbane. Bring me my monster.\u201d\n\u201cIf I can, I will.\u201d\n\u201cDo. You owe me a debt, Jon Snow.\u201d\nJon watched her stride away. She is wrong. She must be wrong. Greyscale is not so deadly as she claims, not in children.\nGhost was gone again. The sun was low in the west. A cup of hot spiced wine would serve me well just now. Two cups would serve me even better. But that would have to wait. He had foes to face. Foes of the worst sort: brothers.\nHe found Leathers waiting for him by the winch cage. The two of them rode up together. The higher they went, the stronger the wind. Fifty feet up, the heavy cage began to sway with every gust. From time to time it scraped against the Wall, starting small crystalline showers of ice that sparkled in the sunlight as they fell. They rose above the tallest towers of the castle. At four hundred feet the wind had teeth, and tore at his black cloak so it slapped noisily at the iron bars. At seven hundred it cut right through him. The Wall is mine, Jon reminded himself as the winchmen were swinging in the cage, for two more days, at least.\nJon hopped down onto the ice, thanked the men on the winch, and nodded to the spearmen standing sentry. Both wore woolen hoods pulled down over their heads, so nothing could be seen of their faces but their eyes, but he knew Ty by the tangled rope of greasy black hair falling down his back and Owen by the sausage stuffed into the scabbard at his hip. He might have known them anyway, just by the way they stood. A good lord must know his men, his father had once told him and Robb, back at Winterfell.\nJon walked to the edge of the Wall and gazed down upon the killing ground where Mance Rayder\u2019s host had died. He wondered where Mance was now. Did he ever find you, little sister? Or were you just a ploy he used so I would set him free?\nIt had been so long since he had last seen Arya. What would she look like now? Would he even know her? Arya Underfoot. Her face was always dirty. Would she still have that little sword he\u2019d had Mikken forge for her? Stick them with the pointy end, he\u2019d told her. Wisdom for her wedding night if half of what he heard of Ramsay Snow was true. Bring her home, Mance. I saved your son from Melisandre, and now I am about to save four thousand of your free folk. You owe me this one little girl.\nIn the haunted forest to the north, the shadows of the afternoon crept through the trees. The western sky was a blaze of red, but to the east the first stars were peeking out. Jon Snow flexed the fingers of his sword hand, remembering all he\u2019d lost. Sam, you sweet fat fool, you played me a cruel jape when you made me lord commander. A lord commander has no friends.\n\u201cLord Snow?\u201d said Leathers. \u201cThe cage is coming up.\u201d\n\u201cI hear it.\u201d Jon moved back from the edge.\nFirst to make the ascent were the clan chiefs Flint and Norrey, clad in fur and iron. The Norrey looked like some old fox\u2014wrinkled and slight of build, but sly-eyed and spry. Torghen Flint was half a head shorter but must weigh twice as much\u2014a stout gruff man with gnarled, red-knuckled hands as big as hams, leaning heavily on a blackthorn cane as he limped across the ice. Bowen Marsh came next, bundled up in a bearskin. After him Othell Yarwyck. Then Septon Cellador, half in his cups.\n\u201cWalk with me,\u201d Jon told them. They walked west along the Wall, down gravel-strewn paths toward the setting sun. When they had come fifty yards from the warming shed, he said, \u201cYou know why I\u2019ve summoned you. Three days hence at dawn the gate will open, to allow Tormund and his people through the Wall. There is much we need to do in preparation.\u201d\nSilence greeted his pronouncement. Then Othell Yarwyck said, \u201cLord Commander, there are thousands of\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014scrawny wildlings, bone weary, hungry, far from home.\u201d Jon pointed at the lights of their campfires. \u201cThere they are. Four thousand, Tormund claims.\u201d\n\u201cThree thousand, I make them, by the fires.\u201d Bowen Marsh lived for counts and measures. \u201cMore than twice that number at Hardhome with the woods witch, we are told. And Ser Denys writes of great camps in the mountains beyond the Shadow Tower\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nJon did not deny it. \u201cTormund says the Weeper means to try the Bridge of Skulls again.\u201d\nThe Old Pomegranate touched his scar. He had gotten it defending the Bridge of Skulls the last time the Weeping Man had tried to cut his way across the Gorge. \u201cSurely the lord commander cannot mean to allow that\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that demon through as well?\u201d\n\u201cNot gladly.\u201d Jon had not forgotten the heads the Weeping Man had left him, with bloody holes where their eyes had been. Black Jack Bulwer, Hairy Hal, Garth Greyfeather. I cannot avenge them, but I will not forget their names. \u201cBut yes, my lord, him as well. We cannot pick and choose amongst the free folk, saying this one may pass, this one may not. Peace means peace for all.\u201d\nThe Norrey hawked and spat. \u201cAs well make peace with wolves and carrion crows.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful in my dungeons,\u201d grumbled Old Flint. \u201cGive the Weeping Man to me.\u201d\n\u201cHow many rangers has the Weeper killed?\u201d asked Othell Yarwyck. \u201cHow many women has he raped or killed or stolen?\u201d\n\u201cThree of mine own ilk,\u201d said Old Flint. \u201cAnd he blinds the girls he does not take.\u201d\n\u201cWhen a man takes the black, his crimes are forgiven,\u201d Jon reminded them. \u201cIf we want the free folk to fight beside us, we must pardon their past crimes as we would for our own.\u201d\n\u201cThe Weeper will not say the words,\u201d insisted Yarwyck. \u201cHe will not wear the cloak. Even other raiders do not trust him.\u201d\n\u201cYou need not trust a man to use him.\u201d Else how could I make use of all of you? \u201cWe need the Weeper, and others like him. Who knows the wild better than a wildling? Who knows our foes better than a man who has fought them?\u201d\n\u201cAll the Weeper knows is rape and murder,\u201d said Yarwyck.\n\u201cOnce past the Wall, the wildlings will have thrice our numbers,\u201d said Bowen Marsh. \u201cAnd that is only Tormund\u2019s band. Add the Weeper\u2019s men and those at Hardhome, and they will have the strength to end the Night\u2019s Watch in a single night.\u201d\n\u201cNumbers alone do not win a war. You have not seen them. Half of them are dead on their feet.\u201d\n\u201cI would sooner have them dead in the ground,\u201d said Yarwyck. \u201cIf it please my lord.\u201d\n\u201cIt does not please me.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was as cold as the wind snapping at their cloaks. \u201cThere are children in that camp, hundreds of them, thousands. Women as well.\u201d\n\u201cSpearwives.\u201d\n\u201cSome. Along with mothers and grandmothers, widows and maids\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would you condemn them all to die, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cBrothers should not squabble,\u201d Septon Cellador said. \u201cLet us kneel and pray to the Crone to light our way to wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cLord Snow,\u201d said The Norrey, \u201cwhere do you mean to put these wildlings o\u2019 yours? Not on my lands, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d declared Old Flint. \u201cYou want them in the Gift, that\u2019s your folly, but see they don\u2019t wander off or I\u2019ll send you back their heads. Winter is nigh, I want no more mouths to feed.\u201d\n\u201cThe wildlings will remain upon the Wall,\u201d Jon assured them. \u201cMost will be housed in one of our abandoned castles.\u201d The Watch now had garrisons at Icemark, Long Barrow, Sable Hall, Greyguard, and Deep Lake, all badly undermanned, but ten castles still stood empty and abandoned. \u201cMen with wives and children, all orphan girls and any orphan boys below the age of ten, old women, widowed mothers, any woman who does not care to fight. The spearwives we\u2019ll send to Long Barrow to join their sisters, single men to the other forts we\u2019ve reopened. Those who take the black will remain here, or be posted to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Tormund will take Oakenshield as his seat, to keep him close at hand.\u201d\nBowen Marsh sighed. \u201cIf they do not slay us with their swords, they will do so with their mouths. Pray, how does the lord commander propose to feed Tormund and his thousands?\u201d\nJon had anticipated that question. \u201cThrough Eastwatch. We will bring in food by ship, as much as might be required. From the riverlands and the stormlands and the Vale of Arryn, from Dorne and the Reach, across the narrow sea from the Free Cities.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this food will be paid for\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how, if I may ask?\u201d\nWith gold, from the Iron Bank of Braavos, Jon might have replied. Instead he said, \u201cI have agreed that the free folk may keep their furs and pelts. They will need those for warmth when winter comes. All other wealth they must surrender. Gold and silver, amber, gemstones, carvings, anything of value. We will ship it all across the narrow sea to be sold in the Free Cities.\u201d\n\u201cAll the wealth o\u2019 the wildlings,\u201d said The Norrey. \u201cThat should buy you a bushel o\u2019 barleycorn. Two bushels, might be.\u201d\n\u201cLord Commander, why not demand that the wildlings give up their arms as well?\u201d asked Clydas.\nLeathers laughed at that. \u201cYou want the free folk to fight beside you against the common foe. How are we to do that without arms? Would you have us throw snowballs at the wights? Or will you give us sticks to hit them with?\u201d\nThe arms most wildlings carry are little more than sticks, thought Jon. Wooden clubs, stone axes, mauls, spears with fire-hardened points, knives of bone and stone and dragonglass, wicker shields, bone armor, boiled leather. The Thenns worked bronze, and raiders like the Weeper carried stolen steel and iron swords looted off some corpse\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but even those were oft of ancient vintage, dinted from years of hard use and spotted with rust.\n\u201cTormund Giantsbane will never willingly disarm his people,\u201d Jon said. \u201cHe is not the Weeping Man, but he is no craven either. If I had asked that of him, it would have come to blood.\u201d\nThe Norrey fingered his beard. \u201cYou may put your wildlings in these ruined forts, Lord Snow, but how will you make them stay? What is there to stop them moving south to fairer, warmer lands?\u201d\n\u201cOur lands,\u201d said Old Flint.\n\u201cTormund has given me his oath. He will serve with us until the spring. The Weeper and their other captains will swear the same or we will not let them pass.\u201d\nOld Flint shook his head. \u201cThey will betray us.\u201d\n\u201cThe Weeper\u2019s word is worthless,\u201d said Othell Yarwyck.\n\u201cThese are godless savages,\u201d said Septon Cellador. \u201cEven in the south the treachery of wildlings is renowned.\u201d\nLeathers crossed his arms. \u201cThat battle down below? I was on t\u2019other side, remember? Now I wear your blacks and train your boys to kill. Some might call me turncloak. Might be so\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I am no more savage than you crows. We have gods too. The same gods they keep in Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods of the North, since before this Wall was raised,\u201d said Jon. \u201cThose are the gods that Tormund swore by. He will keep his word. I know him, as I knew Mance Rayder. I marched with them for a time, you may recall.\u201d\n\u201cI had not forgotten,\u201d said the Lord Steward.\nNo, thought Jon, I did not think you had.\n\u201cMance Rayder swore an oath as well,\u201d Marsh went on. \u201cHe vowed to wear no crowns, take no wife, father no sons. Then he turned his cloak, did all those things, and led a fearsome host against the realm. It is the remnants of that host that waits beyond the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cBroken remnants.\u201d\n\u201cA broken sword can be reforged. A broken sword can kill.\u201d\n\u201cThe free folk have neither laws nor lords,\u201d Jon said, \u201cbut they love their children. Will you admit that much?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not their children who concern us. We fear the fathers, not the sons.\u201d\n\u201cAs do I. So I insisted upon hostages.\u201d I am not the trusting fool you take me for\u00a0\u2026\u00a0nor am I half wildling, no matter what you believe. \u201cOne hundred boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. A son from each of their chiefs and captains, the rest chosen by lot. The boys will serve as pages and squires, freeing our own men for other duties. Some may choose to take the black one day. Queerer things have happened. The rest will stand hostage for the loyalty of their sires.\u201d\nThe northmen glanced at one another. \u201cHostages,\u201d mused The Norrey. \u201cTormund has agreed to this?\u201d\nIt was that, or watch his people die. \u201cMy blood price, he called it,\u201d said Jon Snow, \u201cbut he will pay.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and why not?\u201d Old Flint stomped his cane against the ice. \u201cWards, we always called them, when Winterfell demanded boys of us, but they were hostages, and none the worse for it.\u201d\n\u201cNone but them whose sires displeased the Kings o\u2019 Winter,\u201d said The Norrey. \u201cThose came home shorter by a head. So you tell me, boy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if these wildling friends o\u2019 yours prove false, do you have the belly to do what needs be done?\u201d\nAsk Janos Slynt. \u201cTormund Giantsbane knows better than to try me. I may seem a green boy in your eyes, Lord Norrey, but I am still a son of Eddard Stark.\u201d\nYet even that did not appease his Lord Steward. \u201cYou say these boys will serve as squires. Surely the lord commander does not mean they will be trained at arms?\u201d\nJon\u2019s anger flared. \u201cNo, my lord, I mean to set them to sewing lacy smallclothes. Of course they shall be trained at arms. They shall also churn butter, hew firewood, muck stables, empty chamber pots, and run messages\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and in between they will be drilled with spear and sword and longbow.\u201d\nMarsh flushed a deeper shade of red. \u201cThe lord commander must pardon my bluntness, but I have no softer way to say this. What you propose is nothing less than treason. For eight thousand years the men of the Night\u2019s Watch have stood upon the Wall and fought these wildlings. Now you mean to let them pass, to shelter them in our castles, to feed them and clothe them and teach them how to fight. Lord Snow, must I remind you? You swore an oath.\u201d\n\u201cI know what I swore.\u201d Jon said the words. \u201cI am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. Were those the same words you said when you took your vows?\u201d\n\u201cThey were. As the lord commander knows.\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain that I have not forgotten some? The ones about the king and his laws, and how we must defend every foot of his land and cling to each ruined castle? How does that part go?\u201d Jon waited for an answer. None came. \u201cI am the shield that guards the realms of men. Those are the words. So tell me, my lord\u2014what are these wildlings, if not men?\u201d\nBowen Marsh opened his mouth. No words came out. A flush crept up his neck.\nJon Snow turned away. The last light of the sun had begun to fade. He watched the cracks along the Wall go from red to grey to black, from streaks of fire to rivers of black ice. Down below, Lady Melisandre would be lighting her nightfire and chanting, Lord of Light, defend us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\u201cWinter is coming,\u201d Jon said at last, breaking the awkward silence, \u201cand with it the white walkers. The Wall is where we stop them. The Wall was made to stop them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the Wall must be manned. This discussion is at an end. We have much to do before the gate is opened. Tormund and his people will need to be fed and clothed and housed. Some are sick and will need nursing. Those will fall to you, Clydas. Save as many as you can.\u201d\nClydas blinked his dim pink eyes. \u201cI will do my best, Jon. My lord, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cWe will need every cart and wagon made ready to transport the free folk to their new homes. Othell, you shall see to that.\u201d\nYarwyck grimaced. \u201cAye, Lord Commander.\u201d\n\u201cLord Bowen, you shall collect the tolls. The gold and silver, the amber, the torques and armbands and necklaces. Sort it all, count it, see that it reaches Eastwatch safely.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Lord Snow,\u201d said Bowen Marsh.\nAnd Jon thought, \u201cIce,\u201d she said, \u201cand daggers in the dark. Blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel.\u201d His sword hand flexed. The wind was rising.",

      "content": "CERSEI\nEach night seemed colder than the last.\nThe cell had neither fireplace nor brazier. The only window was too high to allow her a view and too small to squeeze through, but more than large enough to let in the chill. Cersei had torn up the first shift they gave her, demanding the return of her own clothes, but that only left her naked and shivering. When they brought her another shift, she pulled it down over her head and thanked them, choking upon the words.\nThe window let in sounds as well. That was the only way the queen had to know what might be happening in the city. The septas who brought her food would tell her nothing.\nShe hated that. Jaime would be coming for her, but how would she know when he arrived? Cersei only hoped he was not so foolish as to go racing ahead of his army. He would need every sword to deal with the ragged horde of Poor Fellows surrounding the Great Sept. She asked about her twin often, but her gaolers gave no answer. She asked about Ser Loras too. At last report the Knight of Flowers had been dying on Dragonstone of wounds received whilst taking the castle. Let him die, Cersei thought, and let him be quick about it. The boy\u2019s death would mean an empty place on the Kingsguard, and that might be her salvation. But the septas were as close-mouthed about Loras Tyrell as they were about Jaime.\nLord Qyburn had been her last and only visitor. Her world had a population of four: herself and her three gaolers, pious and unyielding. Septa Unella was big-boned and mannish, with callused hands and homely, scowling features. Septa Moelle had stiff white hair and small mean eyes perpetually crinkled in suspicion, peering out of a wrinkled face as sharp as the blade of an axe. Septa Scolera was thick-waisted and short, with heavy breasts, olive skin, and a sour smell to her, like milk on the verge of going bad. They brought her food and water, emptied her chamber pot, and took away her shift for washing every few days, leaving her to huddle naked under her blanket until it was returned to her. Sometimes Scolera would read to her from The Seven-Pointed Star or The Book of Holy Prayer, but elsewise none of them would speak with her or answer any of her questions.\nShe hated and despised all three of them, almost as much as she hated and despised the men who had betrayed her.\nFalse friends, treacherous servants, men who had professed undying love, even her own blood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all of them had deserted her in her hour of need. Osney Kettleblack, that weakling, had broken beneath the lash, filling the High Sparrow\u2019s ears with secrets he should have taken to his grave. His brothers, scum of the streets whom she had raised high, did no more than sit upon their hands. Aurane Waters, her admiral, had fled to sea with the dromonds she had built for him. Orton Merryweather had gone running back to Longtable, taking his wife, Taena, who had been the queen\u2019s one true friend in these terrible times. Harys Swyft and Grand Maester Pycelle had abandoned her to captivity and offered the realm to the very men who had conspired against her. Meryn Trant and Boros Blount, the king\u2019s sworn protectors, were nowhere to be found. Even her cousin Lancel, who once had claimed to love her, was one of her accusers. Her uncle had refused to help her rule when she would have made him the King\u2019s Hand.\nAnd Jaime\u00a0\u2026\nNo, that she could not believe, would not believe. Jaime would be here once he knew of her plight. \u201cCome at once,\u201d she had written to him. \u201cHelp me. Save me. I need you now as I have never needed you before. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come at once.\u201d Qyburn had sworn that he would see that her letter reached her twin, off in the riverlands with his army. Qyburn had never returned, however. For all she knew, he might be dead, his head impaled upon a spike above the city Keep\u2019s gates. Or perhaps he was languishing in one of the black cells beneath the Red Keep, her letter still unsent. The queen had asked after him a hundred times, but her captors would not speak of him. All she knew for certain was that Jaime had not come.\nNot yet, she told herself. But soon. And once he comes the High Sparrow and his bitches will sing a different song.\nShe hated feeling helpless.\nShe had threatened, but her threats had been received with stony faces and deaf ears. She had commanded, but her commands had been ignored. She had invoked the Mother\u2019s mercy, appealing to the natural sympathy of one woman for another, but the three shriveled septas must have put their womanhood aside when they spoke their vows. She had tried charm, speaking to them gently, accepting each new outrage meekly. They were not swayed. She had offered them rewards, promised leniency, honors, gold, positions at court. They treated her promises as they did her threats.\nAnd she had prayed. Oh, how she had prayed. Prayer was what they wanted, so she served it to them, served it on her knees as if she were some common trollop of the streets and not a daughter of the Rock. She had prayed for relief, for deliverance, for Jaime. Loudly she asked the gods to defend her in her innocence; silently she prayed for her accusers to suffer sudden, painful deaths. She prayed until her knees were raw and bloody, until her tongue felt so thick and heavy that she was like to choke on it. All the prayers they had taught her as a girl came back to Cersei in her cell, and she made up new ones as needed, calling on the Mother and the Maiden, on the Father and the Warrior, on the Crone and the Smith. She had even prayed to the Stranger. Any god in a storm. The Seven proved as deaf as their earthly servants. Cersei gave them all the words that she had in her, gave them everything but tears. That they will never have, she told herself.\nShe hated feeling weak.\nIf the gods had given her the strength they gave Jaime and that swaggering oaf Robert, she could have made her own escape. Oh, for a sword and the skill to wield it. She had a warrior\u2019s heart, but the gods in their blind malice had given her the feeble body of a woman. The queen had tried to fight them early on, but the septas had overwhelmed her. There were too many of them, and they were stronger than they looked. Ugly old women, every one of them, but all that praying and scrubbing and beating novices with sticks had left them tough as roots.\nAnd they would not let her rest. Night or day, whenever the queen closed her eyes to sleep, one of her captors would appear to wake her and demand that she confess her sins. She stood accused of adultery, fornication, high treason, even murder, for Osney Kettleblack had confessed to smothering the last High Septon at her command. \u201cI am come to hear you tell of all your murders and fornications,\u201d Septa Unella would growl when she shook the queen awake. Septa Moelle would tell her that it was her sins that kept her sleepless. \u201cOnly the innocent know the peace of untroubled sleep. Confess your sins, and you will sleep like a newborn babe.\u201d\nWake and sleep and wake again, every night was broken into pieces by the rough hands of her tormentors, and every night was colder and crueler than the night before. The hour of the owl, the hour of the wolf, the hour of the nightingale, moonrise and moonset, dusk and dawn, they staggered past like drunkards. What hour was it? What day was it? Where was she? Was this a dream, or had she woken? The little shards of sleep that they allowed her turned into razors, slicing at her wits. Each day found her duller than the day before, exhausted and feverish. She had lost all sense of how long she had been imprisoned in this cell, high up in one of the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor. I will grow old and die here, she thought, despairing.\nCersei could not allow that to happen. Her son had need of her. The realm had need of her. She had to free herself, no matter what the risk. Her world had shrunk to a cell six feet square, a chamber pot, a lumpy pallet, and a brown wool blanket thin as hope that made her skin itch, but she was still Lord Tywin\u2019s heir, a daughter of the Rock.\nExhausted by her lack of sleep, shivering from the cold that stole into the tower cell each night, feverish and famished by turns, Cersei came at last to know she must confess.\nThat night, when Septa Unella came to wrench her out of sleep, she found the queen waiting on her knees. \u201cI have sinned,\u201d said Cersei. Her tongue was thick in her mouth, her lips raw and chapped. \u201cI have sinned most grievously. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long? The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and by its holy light I saw the road that I must walk. I want to be clean again. I want only absolution. Please, good septa, I beg of you, take me to the High Septon so that I might confess my crimes and fornications.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell him, Your Grace,\u201d said Septa Unella. \u201cHis High Holiness will be most pleased. Only through confession and true repentance may our immortal souls be saved.\u201d\nAnd for the rest of that long night they let her sleep. Hours and hours of blessed sleep. The owl and the wolf and the nightingale slipped by for once with their passage unseen and unremarked, whilst Cersei dreamed a long sweet dream where Jaime was her husband and their son was still alive.\nCome morning, the queen felt almost like herself again. When her captors came for her, she made pious noises at them again and told them how determined she was to confess her sins and be forgiven for all that she had done.\n\u201cWe rejoice to hear it,\u201d said Septa Moelle.\n\u201cIt will be a great weight off your soul,\u201d said Septa Scolera. \u201cYou will feel much better afterward, Your Grace.\u201d\nYour Grace. Those two simple words thrilled her. During her long captivity, her gaolers had not oft bothered with even that simple courtesy.\n\u201cHis High Holiness awaits,\u201d said Septa Unella.\nCersei lowered her head, humble and obedient. \u201cMight I be allowed to bathe first? I am in no fit state to attend him.\u201d\n\u201cYou may wash later if His High Holiness allows,\u201d said Septa Unella. \u201cIt is the cleanliness of your immortal soul that should concern you now, not such vanities of the flesh.\u201d\nThe three septas led her down the tower stairs, with Septa Unella going before her and Septa Moelle and Septa Scolera at her heels, as if they were afraid that she might try to flee. \u201cIt has been so long since I have had a visitor,\u201d Cersei murmured in a quiet voice as they made their descent. \u201cIs the king well? I ask only as a mother, fearful for her child.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is in good health,\u201d said Septa Scolera, \u201cand well protected, day and night. The queen is with him, always.\u201d\nI am the queen! She swallowed, smiled, and said, \u201cThat is good to know. Tommen loves her so. I never believed those terrible things that were being said of her.\u201d Had Margaery Tyrell somehow wriggled free of the accusations of fornication, adultery, and high treason? \u201cWas there a trial?\u201d\n\u201cSoon,\u201d said Septa Scolera, \u201cbut her brother\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d Septa Unella turned to glare back over her shoulder at Scolera. \u201cYou chatter too much, you foolish old woman. It is not for us to speak of such things.\u201d\nScolera lowered her head. \u201cPray forgive me.\u201d\nThey made the rest of the descent in silence.\nThe High Sparrow received her in his sanctum, an austere seven-sided chamber where crudely carved faces of the Seven stared out from the stone walls with expressions almost as sour and disapproving as His High Holiness himself. When she entered, he was seated behind a rough-hewn table, writing. The High Septon had not changed since the last time she had been in his presence, the day he had her seized and imprisoned. He was still a scrawny grey-haired man with a lean, hard, half-starved look, his face sharp-featured, lined, his eyes suspicious. In place of the rich robes of his predecessors, he wore a shapeless tunic of undyed wool that fell down to his ankles. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, by way of greeting. \u201cI understand that you wish to make confession.\u201d\nCersei dropped to her knees. \u201cI do, High Holiness. The Crone came to me as I slept with her lamp held high\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure. Unella, you will stay and make a record of Her Grace\u2019s words. Scolera, Moelle, you have my leave to go.\u201d He pressed the fingers of his hands together, the same gesture she had seen her father use a thousand times.\nSepta Unella took a seat behind her, spread out a parchment, dipped a quill in maester\u2019s ink. Cersei felt a stab of fright. \u201cOnce I have confessed, will I be permitted to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace shall be dealt with according to your sins.\u201d\nThis man is implacable, she realized once again. She gathered herself for a moment. \u201cMother have mercy on me, then. I have lain with men outside the bonds of marriage. I confess it.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d The High Septon\u2019s eyes were fixed on hers.\nCersei could hear Unella writing behind her. Her quill made a faint, soft scratching sound. \u201cLancel Lannister, my cousin. And Osney Kettleblack.\u201d Both men had confessed to bedding her, it would do her no good to deny it. \u201cHis brothers too. Both of them.\u201d She had no way of knowing what Osfryd and Osmund might say. Safer to confess too much than too little. \u201cIt does not excuse my sin, High Holiness, but I was lonely and afraid. The gods took King Robert from me, my love and my protector. I was alone, surrounded by schemers, false friends, and traitors who were conspiring at the death of my children. I did not know who to trust, so I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I used the only means that I had to bind the Kettleblacks to me.\u201d\n\u201cBy which you mean your female parts?\u201d\n\u201cMy flesh.\u201d She pressed a hand to her face, shuddering. When she lowered it again, her eyes were wet with tears. \u201cYes. May the Maid forgive me. It was for my children, though, for the realm. I took no pleasure in it. The Kettleblacks\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they are hard men, and cruel, and they used me roughly, but what else was I to do? Tommen needed men around him I could trust.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace was protected by the Kingsguard.\u201d\n\u201cThe Kingsguard stood by useless as his brother Joffrey died, murdered at his own wedding feast. I watched one son die, I could not bear to lose another. I have sinned, I have committed wanton fornication, but I did it for Tommen. Forgive me, High Holiness, but I would open my legs for every man in King\u2019s Landing if that was what I had to do to keep my children safe.\u201d\n\u201cForgiveness comes only from the gods. What of Ser Lancel, who was your cousin and your lord husband\u2019s squire? Did you take him into your bed to win his loyalty as well?\u201d\n\u201cLancel.\u201d Cersei hesitated. Careful, she told herself, Lancel will have told him everything. \u201cLancel loved me. He was half a boy, but I never doubted his devotion to me or my son.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you still corrupted him.\u201d\n\u201cI was lonely.\u201d She choked back a sob. \u201cI had lost my husband, my son, my lord father. I was regent, but a queen is still a woman, and women are weak vessels, easily tempted\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Your High Holiness knows the truth of that. Even holy septas have been known to sin. I took comfort with Lancel. He was kind and gentle and I needed someone. It was wrong, I know, but I had no one else\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a woman needs to be loved, she needs a man beside her, she\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she\u00a0\u2026\u201d She began to sob uncontrollably.\nThe High Septon made no move to comfort her. He sat there with his hard eyes fixed on her, watching her weep, as stony as the statues of the Seven in the sept above. Long moments passed, but finally her tears were all dried up. By then her eyes were red and raw from crying, and she felt as if she might faint.\nThe High Sparrow was not done with her, however. \u201cThese are common sins,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wickedness of widows is well-known, and all women are wantons at heart, given to using their wiles and their beauty to work their wills on men. There is no treason here, so long as you did not stray from your marriage bed whilst His Grace King Robert was still alive.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d she whispered, shivering. \u201cNever, I swear it.\u201d\nHe paid that no mind. \u201cThere are other charges laid against Your Grace, crimes far more grievous than simple fornications. You admit Ser Osney Kettleblack was your lover, and Ser Osney insists that he smothered my predecessor at your behest. He further insists that he bore false witness against Queen Margaery and her cousins, telling tales of fornications, adultery, and high treason, again at your behest.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cIt is not true. I love Margaery as I would a daughter. And the other\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I complained of the High Septon, I admit it. He was Tyrion\u2019s creature, weak and corrupt, a stain upon our Holy Faith. Your High Holiness knows that as well as I. It may be that Osney thought that his death would please me. If so, I bear some part of the blame\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but murder? No. Of that I am innocent. Take me to the sept and I will stand before the Father\u2019s judgment seat and swear the truth of that.\u201d\n\u201cIn time,\u201d said the High Septon. \u201cYou also stand accused of conspiring at the murder of your own lord husband, our late beloved King Robert, First of His Name.\u201d\nLancel, Cersei thought. \u201cRobert was killed by a boar. Do they say I am a skinchanger now? A warg? Am I accused of killing Joffrey too, my own sweet son, my firstborn?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Just your husband. Do you deny it?\u201d\n\u201cI deny it. I do. Before gods and men, I deny it.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cLast of all, and worst of all, there are some who say your children were not fathered by King Robert, that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.\u201d\n\u201cStannis says that,\u201d Cersei said at once. \u201cA lie, a lie, a palpable lie. Stannis wants the Iron Throne for himself, but his brother\u2019s children stand in his way, so he must needs claim that they are not his brother\u2019s. That filthy letter\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there is no shred of truth to it. I deny it.\u201d\nThe High Septon placed both hands flat upon the table and pushed himself to his feet. \u201cGood. Lord Stannis has turned from the truth of the Seven to worship a red demon, and his false faith has no place in these Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\nThat was almost reassuring. Cersei nodded.\n\u201cEven so,\u201d His High Holiness went on, \u201cthese are terrible charges, and the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has told it true, no doubt a trial will prove your innocence.\u201d\nA trial, still. \u201cI have confessed\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014to certain sins, aye. Others you deny. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods. I shall ask the Seven to forgive the sins you have confessed and pray that you be found innocent of these other accusations.\u201d\nCersei rose slowly from her knees. \u201cI bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother\u2019s mercy, I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it has been so long since I last saw my son, please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe old man\u2019s eyes were chips of flint. \u201cIt would not be fitting to allow you near the king until you have been cleansed of all your wickedness. You have taken the first step on your path back to righteousness, however, and in light of that I shall permit you other visitors. One each day.\u201d\nThe queen began to weep again. This time the tears were true. \u201cYou are too kind. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mother is merciful. It is her that you should thank.\u201d\nMoelle and Scolera were waiting to lead her back up to her tower cell. Unella followed close behind them. \u201cWe have all been praying for Your Grace,\u201d Septa Moelle said as they were climbing. \u201cYes,\u201d Septa Scolera echoed, \u201cand you must feel so much lighter now, clean and innocent as a maid on the morning of her wedding.\u201d\nI fucked Jaime on the morning of my wedding, the queen recalled. \u201cI do,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel reborn, as if a festering boil has been lanced and now at last I can begin to heal. I could almost fly.\u201d She imagined how sweet it would be to slam an elbow into Septa Scolera\u2019s face and send her careening down the spiral steps. If the gods were good, the wrinkled old cunt might crash into Septa Unella and take her down with her.\n\u201cIt is good to see you smiling again,\u201d Scolera said.\n\u201cHis High Holiness said I might have visitors?\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d said Septa Unella. \u201cIf Your Grace will tell us whom you wish to see, we will send word to them.\u201d\nJaime, I need Jaime. But if her twin was in the city, why had he not come to her? It might be wiser to wait on Jaime until she had a better notion of what was happening beyond the walls of the Great Sept of Baelor. \u201cMy uncle,\u201d she said. \u201cSer Kevan Lannister, my father\u2019s brother. Is he in the city?\u201d\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said Septa Unella. \u201cThe Lord Regent has taken up residence in the Red Keep. We will send for him at once.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Cersei, thinking, Lord Regent, is it? She could not pretend to be surprised.\nA humble and a contrite heart proved to have benefits over and beyond cleansing the soul of sin. That night the queen was moved to a larger cell two floors down, with a window she could actually look out of and warm, soft blankets for her bed. And when time came for supper, instead of stale bread and oaten porridge, she was served a roast capon, a bowl of crisp greens sprinkled with crushed walnuts, and a mound of mashed neeps aswim in butter. That night she crawled into her bed with a full stomach for the first time since she was taken, and slept through the black watches of the night undisturbed.\nThe next morning, with the dawn, there came her uncle.\nCersei was still at her breakfast when the door swung open and Ser Kevan Lannister stepped through. \u201cLeave us,\u201d he told her gaolers. Septa Unella ushered Scolera and Moelle away and closed the door behind them. The queen rose to her feet.\nSer Kevan looked older than when she\u2019d seen him last. He was a big man, broad in the shoulder and thick about the waist, with a close-cropped blond beard that followed the line of his heavy jaw and short blond hair in full retreat from his brow. A heavy woolen cloak, dyed crimson, was clasped at one shoulder with a golden brooch in the shape of a lion\u2019s head.\n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d the queen said.\nHer uncle frowned. \u201cYou should sit. There are things that I must needs tell you\u2014\u201d\nShe did not want to sit. \u201cYou are still angry with me. I hear it in your voice. Forgive me, Uncle. It was wrong of me to throw my wine at you, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think I care about a cup of wine? Lancel is my son, Cersei. Your own nephew. If I am angry with you, that is the cause. You should have looked after him, guided him, found him a likely girl of good family. Instead you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know.\u201d Lancel wanted me more than I ever wanted him. He still does, I will wager. \u201cI was alone, weak. Please. Uncle. Oh, Uncle. It is so good to see your face, your sweet sweet face. I have done wicked things, I know, but I could not bear for you to hate me.\u201d She threw her arms around him, kissed his cheek. \u201cForgive me. Forgive me.\u201d\nSer Kevan suffered the embrace for a few heartbeats before he finally raised his own arms to return it. His hug was short and awkward. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said, his voice still flat and cold. \u201cYou are forgiven. Now sit. I bring some hard tidings, Cersei.\u201d\nHis words frightened her. \u201cHas something happened to Tommen? Please, no. I have been so afraid for my son. No one will tell me anything. Please tell me that Tommen is well.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is well. He asks about you often.\u201d Ser Kevan laid his hands on her shoulders, held her at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cJaime, then? Is it Jaime?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Jaime is still in the riverlands, somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere?\u201d She did not like the sound of that.\n\u201cHe took Raventree and accepted Lord Blackwood\u2019s surrender,\u201d said her uncle, \u201cbut on his way back to Riverrun he left his tail and went off with a woman.\u201d\n\u201cA woman?\u201d Cersei stared at him, uncomprehending. \u201cWhat woman? Why? Where did they go?\u201d\n\u201cNo one knows. We\u2019ve had no further word of him. The woman may have been the Evenstar\u2019s daughter, Lady Brienne.\u201d\nHer. The queen remembered the Maid of Tarth, a huge, ugly, shambling thing who dressed in man\u2019s mail. Jaime would never abandon me for such a creature. My raven never reached him, elsewise he would have come.\n\u201cWe have had reports of sellswords landing all over the south,\u201d Ser Kevan was saying. \u201cTarth, the Stepstones, Cape Wrath\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where Stannis found the coin to hire a free company I would dearly love to know. I do not have the strength to deal with them, not here. Mace Tyrell does, but he refuses to bestir himself until this matter with his daughter has been settled.\u201d\nA headsman would settle Margaery quick enough. Cersei did not care a fig for Stannis or his sellswords. The Others take him and the Tyrells both. Let them slaughter each other, the realm will be the better for it. \u201cPlease, Uncle, take me out of here.\u201d\n\u201cHow? By force of arms?\u201d Ser Kevan walked to the window and gazed out, frowning. \u201cI would need to make an abbatoir of this holy place. And I do not have the men. The best part of our forces were at Riverrun with your brother. I had no time to raise up a new host.\u201d He turned back to face her. \u201cI have spoken with His High Holiness. He will not release you until you have atoned for your sins.\u201d\n\u201cI have confessed.\u201d\n\u201cAtoned, I said. Before the city. A walk\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She knew what her uncle was about to say, and she did not want to hear it. \u201cNever. Tell him that, if you speak again. I am a queen, not some dockside whore.\u201d\n\u201cNo harm would come to you. No one will touch\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, more sharply. \u201cI would sooner die.\u201d\nSer Kevan was unmoved. \u201cIf that is your wish, you may soon have it granted. His High Holiness is resolved that you be tried for regicide, deicide, incest, and high treason.\u201d\n\u201cDeicide?\u201d She almost laughed. \u201cWhen did I kill a god?\u201d\n\u201cThe High Septon speaks for the Seven here on earth. Strike at him, and you are striking at the gods themselves.\u201d Her uncle raised a hand before she could protest. \u201cIt does no good to speak of such things. Not here. The time for all that is at trial.\u201d He gazed about her cell. The look on his face spoke volumes.\nSomeone is listening. Even here, even now, she dare not speak freely. She took a breath. \u201cWho will try me?\u201d\n\u201cThe Faith,\u201d her uncle said, \u201cunless you insist on a trial by battle. In which case you must be championed by a knight of the Kingsguard. Whatever the outcome, your rule is at an end. I will serve as Tommen\u2019s regent until he comes of age. Mace Tyrell has been named King\u2019s Hand. Grand Maester Pycelle and Ser Harys Swyft will continue as before, but Paxter Redwyne is now lord admiral and Randyll Tarly has assumed the duties of justiciar.\u201d\nTyrell bannermen, the both of them. The whole governance of the realm was being handed to her enemies, Queen Margaery\u2019s kith and kin. \u201cMargaery stands accused as well. Her and those cousins of hers. How is it that the sparrows freed her and not me?\u201d\n\u201cRandyll Tarly insisted. He was the first to reach King\u2019s Landing when this storm broke, and he brought his army with him. The Tyrell girls will still be tried, but the case against them is weak, His High Holiness admits. All of the men named as the queen\u2019s lovers have denied the accusation or recanted, save for your maimed singer, who appears to be half-mad. So the High Septon handed the girls over to Tarly\u2019s custody and Lord Randyll swore a holy oath to deliver them for trial when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her accusers?\u201d the queen demanded. \u201cWho holds them?\u201d\n\u201cOsney Kettleblack and the Blue Bard are here, beneath the sept. The Redwyne twins have been declared innocent, and Hamish the Harper has died. The rest are in the dungeons under the Red Keep, in the charge of your man Qyburn.\u201d\nQyburn, thought Cersei. That was good, one straw at least that she could clutch. Lord Qyburn had them, and Lord Qyburn could do wonders. And horrors. He can do horrors as well.\n\u201cThere is more, worse. Will you sit down?\u201d\n\u201cSit down?\u201d Cersei shook her head. What could be worse? She was to be tried for high treason whilst the little queen and her cousins flew off as free as birds. \u201cTell me. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cMyrcella. We have had grave news from Dorne.\u201d\n\u201cTyrion,\u201d she said at once. Tyrion had sent her little girl to Dorne, and Cersei had dispatched Ser Balon Swann to bring her home. All Dornishmen were snakes, and the Martells were the worst of them. The Red Viper had even tried to defend the Imp, had come within a hairbreadth of a victory that would have allowed the dwarf to escape the blame for Joffrey\u2019s murder. \u201cIt\u2019s him, he\u2019s been in Dorne all this time, and now he\u2019s seized my daughter.\u201d\nSer Kevan gave her another scowl. \u201cMyrcella was attacked by a Dornish knight named Gerold Dayne. She\u2019s alive, but hurt. He slashed her face open, she\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m sorry\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she lost an ear.\u201d\n\u201cAn ear.\u201d Cersei stared at him, aghast. She was just a child, my precious princess. She was so pretty, too. \u201cHe cut off her ear. And Prince Doran and his Dornish knights, where were they? They could not defend one little girl? Where was Arys Oakheart?\u201d\n\u201cSlain, defending her. Dayne cut him down, it\u2019s said.\u201d\nThe Sword of the Morning had been a Dayne, the queen recalled, but he was long dead. Who was this Ser Gerold and why would he wish to harm her daughter? She could not make any sense of this, unless\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cTyrion lost half his nose in the Battle of the Blackwater. Slashing her face, cutting off an ear\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the Imp\u2019s grubby little fingers are all over this.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Doran says nothing of your brother. And Balon Swann writes that Myrcella puts it all on this Gerold Dayne. Darkstar, they call him.\u201d\nShe gave a bitter laugh. \u201cWhatever they call him, he is my brother\u2019s catspaw. Tyrion has friends amongst the Dornish. The Imp planned this all along. It was Tyrion who betrothed Myrcella to Prince Trystane. Now I see why.\u201d\n\u201cYou see Tyrion in every shadow.\u201d\n\u201cHe is a creature of the shadows. He killed Joffrey. He killed Father. Did you think he would stop there? I feared that the Imp was still in King\u2019s Landing plotting harm to Tommen, but he must have gone to Dorne instead to kill Myrcella first.\u201d Cersei paced the width of the cell. \u201cI need to be with Tommen. These Kingsguard knights are as useless as nipples on a breastplate.\u201d She rounded on her uncle. \u201cSer Arys was killed, you said.\u201d\n\u201cAt the hands of this man Darkstar, yes.\u201d\n\u201cDead, he\u2019s dead, you are certain of that?\u201d\n\u201cThat is what we have been told.\u201d\n\u201cThen there is an empty place amongst the Kingsguard. It must be filled at once. Tommen must be protected.\u201d\n\u201cLord Tarly is drawing up a list of worthy knights for your brother to consider, but until Jaime reappears\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe king can give a man a white cloak. Tommen\u2019s a good boy. Tell him who to name and he will name him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who would you have him name?\u201d\nShe did not have a ready answer. My champion will need a new name as well as a new face. \u201cQyburn will know. Trust him in this. You and I have had our differences, Uncle, but for the blood we share and the love you bore my father, for Tommen\u2019s sake and the sake of his poor maimed sister, do as I ask you. Go to Lord Qyburn on my behalf, bring him a white cloak, and tell him that the time has come.\u201d",

      "content": "THE QUEENSGUARD\nYou were the queen\u2019s man,\u201d said Reznak mo Reznak. \u201cThe king desires his own men about him when he holds court.\u201d\nI am the queen\u2019s man still. Today, tomorrow, always, until my last breath, or hers. Barristan Selmy refused to believe that Daenerys Targaryen was dead.\nPerhaps that was why he was being put aside. One by one, Hizdahr removes us all. Strong Belwas lingered at the door of death in the temple, under the care of the Blue Graces\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though Selmy half suspected they were finishing the job those honeyed locusts had begun. Skahaz Shavepate had been stripped of his command. The Unsullied had withdrawn to their barracks. Jhogo, Daario Naharis, Admiral Groleo, and Hero of the Unsullied remained hostages of the Yunkai\u2019i. Aggo and Rakharo and the rest of the queen\u2019s khalasar had been dispatched across the river to search for their lost queen. Even Missandei had been replaced; the king did not think it fit to use a child as his herald, and a onetime Naathi slave at that. And now me.\nThere was a time when he might have taken this dismissal as a blot upon his honor. But that was in Westeros. In the viper\u2019s pit that was Meereen, honor seemed as silly as a fool\u2019s motley. And this mistrust was mutual. Hizdahr zo Loraq might be his queen\u2019s consort, but he would never be his king. \u201cIf His Grace wishes for me to remove myself from court\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHis Radiance,\u201d the seneschal corrected. \u201cNo, no, no, you misunderstand me. His Worship is to receive a delegation from the Yunkai\u2019i, to discuss the withdrawal of their armies. They may ask for\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ah\u00a0\u2026\u00a0recompense for those who lost their lives to the dragon\u2019s wroth. A delicate situation. The king feels it will be better if they see a Meereenese king upon the throne, protected by Meereenese warriors. Surely you can understand that, ser.\u201d\nI understand more than you know. \u201cMight I know which men His Grace has chosen to protect him?\u201d\nReznak mo Reznak smiled his slimy smile. \u201cFearsome fighters, who love His Worship well. Goghor the Giant. Khrazz. The Spotted Cat. Belaquo Bonebreaker. Heroes all.\u201d\nPit fighters all. Ser Barristan was unsurprised. Hizdahr zo Loraq sat uneasily on his new throne. It had been a thousand years since Meereen last had a king, and there were some even amongst the old blood who thought they might have made a better choice than him. Outside the city sat the Yunkai\u2019i with their sellswords and their allies; inside were the Sons of the Harpy.\nAnd the king\u2019s protectors grew fewer every day. Hizdahr\u2019s blunder with Grey Worm had cost him the Unsullied. When His Grace had tried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, Grey Worm had informed the king that they were free men who took commands only from their mother. As for the Brazen Beasts, half were freedmen and the rest shavepates, whose true loyalty might still be to Skahaz mo Kandaq. The pit fighters were King Hizdahr\u2019s only reliable support, against a sea of enemies.\n\u201cMay they defend His Grace against all threats.\u201d Ser Barristan\u2019s tone gave no hint of his true feelings; he had learned to hide such back in King\u2019s Landing years ago.\n\u201cHis Magnificence,\u201d Reznak mo Reznak stressed. \u201cYour other duties shall remain unchanged, ser. Should this peace fail, His Radiance would still wish for you to command his forces against the enemies of our city.\u201d\nHe has that much sense, at least. Belaquo Bonebreaker and Goghor the Giant might serve as Hizdahr\u2019s shields, but the notion of either leading an army into battle was so ludicrous that the old knight almost smiled. \u201cI am His Grace\u2019s to command.\u201d\n\u201cNot Grace,\u201d the seneschal complained. \u201cThat style is Westerosi. His Magnificence, His Radiance, His Worship.\u201d\nHis Vanity would fit better. \u201cAs you say.\u201d\nReznak licked his lips. \u201cThen we are done.\u201d This time his oily smile betokened dismissal. Ser Barristan took his leave, grateful to leave the stench of the seneschal\u2019s perfume behind him. A man should smell of sweat, not flowers.\nThe Great Pyramid of Meereen was eight hundred feet high from base to point. The seneschal\u2019s chambers were on the second level. The queen\u2019s apartments, and his own, occupied the highest step. A long climb for a man my age, Ser Barristan thought, as he started up. He had been known to make that climb five or six times a day on the queen\u2019s business, as the aches in his knees and the small of his back could attest. There will come a day when I can no longer face these steps, he thought, and that day will be here sooner than I would like. Before it came, he must make certain that at least a few of his lads were ready to take his place at the queen\u2019s side. I will knight them myself when they are worthy, and give them each a horse and golden spurs.\nThe royal apartments were still and silent. Hizdahr had not taken up residence there, preferring to establish his own suite of rooms deep in the heart of the Great Pyramid, where massive brick walls surrounded him on all sides. Mezzara, Miklaz, Qezza, and the rest of the queen\u2019s young cupbearers\u2014hostages in truth, but both Selmy and the queen had become so fond of them that it was hard for him to think of them that way\u2014had gone with the king, whilst Irri and Jhiqui departed with the other Dothraki. Only Missandei remained, a forlorn little ghost haunting the queen\u2019s chambers at the apex of the pyramid.\nSer Barristan walked out onto the terrace. The sky above Meereen was the color of corpse flesh, dull and white and heavy, a mass of unbroken cloud from horizon to horizon. The sun was hidden behind a wall of cloud. It would set unseen, as it had risen unseen that morning. The night would be hot, a sweaty, suffocating, sticky sort of night without a breath of air. For three days rain had threatened, but not a drop had fallen. Rain would come as a relief. It might help wash the city clean.\nFrom here he could see four lesser pyramids, the city\u2019s western walls, and the camps of the Yunkishmen by the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay, where a thick column of greasy smoke twisted upward like some monstrous serpent. The Yunkishmen burning their dead, he realized. The pale mare is galloping through their siege camps. Despite all the queen had done, the sickness had spread, both within the city walls and without. Meereen\u2019s markets were closed, its streets empty. King Hizdahr had allowed the fighting pits to remain open, but the crowds were sparse. The Meereenese had even begun to shun the Temple of the Graces, reportedly.\nThe slavers will find some way to blame Daenerys for that as well, Ser Barristan thought bitterly. He could almost hear them whispering\u2014Great Masters, Sons of the Harpy, Yunkai\u2019i, all telling one another that his queen was dead. Half of the city believed it, though as yet they did not have the courage to say such words aloud. But soon, I think.\nSer Barristan felt very tired, very old. Where have all the years gone? Of late, whenever he knelt to drink from a still pool, he saw a stranger\u2019s face gazing up from the water\u2019s depths. When had those crow\u2019s-feet first appeared around his pale blue eyes? How long ago had his hair turned from sunlight into snow? Years ago, old man. Decades.\nYet it seemed like only yesterday that he had been raised to knighthood, after the tourney at King\u2019s Landing. He could still recall the touch of King Aegon\u2019s sword upon his shoulder, light as a maiden\u2019s kiss. His words had caught in his throat when he spoke his vows. At the feast that night he had eaten ribs of wild boar, prepared the Dornish way with dragon peppers, so hot they burned his mouth. Forty-seven years, and the taste still lingered in his memory, yet he could not have said what he had supped on ten days ago if all seven kingdoms had depended on it. Boiled dog, most like. Or some other foul dish that tasted no better.\nNot for the first time, Selmy wondered at the strange fates that had brought him here. He was a knight of Westeros, a man of the stormlands and the Dornish marches; his place was in the Seven Kingdoms, not here upon the sweltering shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay. I came to bring Daenerys home. Yet he had lost her, just as he had lost her father and her brother. Even Robert. I failed him too.\nPerhaps Hizdahr was wiser than he knew. Ten years ago I would have sensed what Daenerys meant to do. Ten years ago I would have been quick enough to stop her. Instead he had stood befuddled as she leapt into the pit, shouting her name, then running uselessly after her across the scarlet sands. I am become old and slow. Small wonder Naharis mocked him as Ser Grandfather. Would Daario have moved more quickly if he had been beside the queen that day? Selmy thought he knew the answer to that, though it was not one he liked.\nHe had dreamed of it again last night: Belwas on his knees retching up bile and blood, Hizdahr urging on the dragonslayers, men and women fleeing in terror, fighting on the steps, climbing over one another, screaming and shouting. And Daenerys\u00a0\u2026\nHer hair was aflame. She had the whip in her hand and she was shouting, then she was on the dragon\u2019s back, flying. The sand that Drogon stirred as he took wing had stung Ser Barristan\u2019s eyes, but through a veil of tears he had watched the beast fly from the pit, his great black wings slapping at the shoulders of the bronze warriors at the gates.\nThe rest he learned later. Beyond the gates had been a solid press of people. Maddened by the smell of dragon, horses below reared in terror, lashing out with iron-shod hooves. Food stalls and palanquins alike were overturned, men knocked down and trampled. Spears were thrown, crossbows were fired. Some struck home. The dragon twisted violently in the air, wounds smoking, the girl clinging to his back. Then he loosed the fire.\nIt had taken the rest of the day and most of the night for the Brazen Beasts to gather up the corpses. The final count was two hundred fourteen slain, three times as many burned or wounded. Drogon was gone from the city by then, last seen high over the Skahazadhan, flying north. Of Daenerys Targaryen, no trace had been found. Some swore they saw her fall. Others insisted that the dragon had carried her off to devour her. They are wrong.\nSer Barristan knew no more of dragons than the tales every child hears, but he knew Targaryens. Daenerys had been riding that dragon, as Aegon had once ridden Balerion of old.\n\u201cShe might be flying home,\u201d he told himself, aloud.\n\u201cNo,\u201d murmured a soft voice behind him. \u201cShe would not do that, ser. She would not go home without us.\u201d\nSer Barristan turned. \u201cMissandei. Child. How long have you been standing there?\u201d\n\u201cNot long. This one is sorry if she has disturbed you.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cSkahaz mo Kandaq wishes words with you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Shavepate? You spoke with him?\u201d That was rash, rash. The enmity ran deep between Shakaz and the king, and the girl was clever enough to know that. Skahaz had been outspoken in his opposition to the queen\u2019s marriage, a fact Hizdahr had not forgotten. \u201cIs he here? In the pyramid?\u201d\n\u201cWhen he wishes. He comes and goes, ser.\u201d\nYes. He would. \u201cWho told you he wants words with me?\u201d\n\u201cA Brazen Beast. He wore an owl mask.\u201d\nHe wore an owl mask when he spoke to you. By now he could be a jackal, a tiger, a sloth. Ser Barristan had hated the masks from the start and never more than now. Honest men should never need to hide their faces. And the Shavepate\u00a0\u2026\nWhat could he be thinking? After Hizdahr had given command of the Brazen Beasts to his cousin Marghaz zo Loraq, Skahaz had been named Warden of the River, with charge of all the ferries, dredges, and irrigation ditches along the Skahazadhan for fifty leagues, but the Shavepate had refused that ancient and honorable office, as Hizdahr called it, preferring to retire to the modest pyramid of Kandaq. Without the queen to protect him, he takes a great risk coming here. And if Ser Barristan were seen speaking with him, suspicion might fall on the knight as well.\nHe did not like the taste of this. It smelled of deceit, of whispers and lies and plots hatched in the dark, all the things he\u2019d hoped to leave behind with the Spider and Lord Littlefinger and their ilk. Barristan Selmy was not a bookish man, but he had often glanced through the pages of the White Book, where the deeds of his predecessors had been recorded. Some had been heroes, some weaklings, knaves, or cravens. Most were only men\u2014quicker and stronger than most, more skilled with sword and shield, but still prey to pride, ambition, lust, love, anger, jealousy, greed for gold, hunger for power, and all the other failings that afflicted lesser mortals. The best of them overcame their flaws, did their duty, and died with their swords in their hands. The worst\u00a0\u2026\nThe worst were those who played the game of thrones. \u201cCan you find this owl again?\u201d he asked Missandei.\n\u201cThis one can try, ser.\u201d\n\u201cTell him I will speak with\u00a0\u2026\u00a0with our friend\u00a0\u2026\u00a0after dark, by the stables.\u201d The pyramid\u2019s main doors were closed and barred at sunset. The stables would be quiet at that hour. \u201cMake certain it is the same owl.\u201d It would not serve to have the wrong Brazen Beast hear of this.\n\u201cThis one understands.\u201d Missandei turned as if to go, then paused a moment and said, \u201cIt is said that the Yunkai\u2019i have ringed the city all about with scorpions, to loose iron bolts into the sky should Drogon return.\u201d\nSer Barristan had heard that too. \u201cIt is no simple thing to slay a dragon in the sky. In Westeros, many tried to bring down Aegon and his sisters. None succeeded.\u201d\nMissandei nodded. It was hard to tell if she was reassured. \u201cDo you think that they will find her, ser? The grasslands are so vast, and dragons leave no tracks across the sky.\u201d\n\u201cAggo and Rakharo are blood of her blood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and who knows the Dothraki sea better than Dothraki?\u201d He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThey will find her if she can be found.\u201d If she still lives. There were other khals who prowled the grass, horselords with khalasars whose riders numbered in the tens of thousands. But the girl did not need to hear that. \u201cYou love her well, I know. I swear, I shall keep her safe.\u201d\nThe words seemed to give the girl some comfort. Words are wind, though, Ser Barristan thought. How can I protect the queen when I am not with her?\nBarristan Selmy had known many kings. He had been born during the troubled reign of Aegon the Unlikely, beloved by the common folk, had received his knighthood at his hands. Aegon\u2019s son Jaehaerys had bestowed the white cloak on him when he was three-and-twenty, after he slew Maelys the Monstrous during the War of the Ninepenny Kings. In that same cloak he had stood beside the Iron Throne as madness consumed Jaehaerys\u2019s son Aerys. Stood, and saw, and heard, and yet did nothing.\nBut no. That was not fair. He did his duty. Some nights, Ser Barristan wondered if he had not done that duty too well. He had sworn his vows before the eyes of gods and men, he could not in honor go against them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the keeping of those vows had grown hard in the last years of King Aerys\u2019s reign. He had seen things that it pained him to recall, and more than once he wondered how much of the blood was on his own hands. If he had not gone into Duskendale to rescue Aerys from Lord Darklyn\u2019s dungeons, the king might well have died there as Tywin Lannister sacked the town. Then Prince Rhaegar would have ascended the Iron Throne, mayhaps to heal the realm. Duskendale had been his finest hour, yet the memory tasted bitter on his tongue.\nIt was his failures that haunted him at night, though. Jaehaerys, Aerys, Robert. Three dead kings. Rhaegar, who would have been a finer king than any of them. Princess Elia and the children. Aegon just a babe, Rhaenys with her kitten. Dead, every one, yet he still lived, who had sworn to protect them. And now Daenerys, his bright shining child queen. She is not dead. I will not believe it.\nAfternoon brought Ser Barristan a brief respite from his doubts. He spent it in the training hall on the pyramid\u2019s third level, working with his boys, teaching them the art of sword and shield, horse and lance\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and chivalry, the code that made a knight more than any pit fighter. Daenerys would need protectors her own age about her after he was gone, and Ser Barristan was determined to give her such.\nThe lads he was instructing ranged in age from eight to twenty. He had started with more than sixty of them, but the training had proved too rigorous for many. Less than half that number now remained, but some showed great promise. With no king to guard, I will have more time to train them now, he realized as he walked from pair to pair, watching them go at one another with blunted swords and spears with rounded heads. Brave boys. Baseborn, aye, but some will make good knights, and they love the queen. If not for her, all of them would have ended in the pits. King Hizdahr has his pit fighters, but Daenerys will have knights.\n\u201cKeep your shield up,\u201d he called. \u201cShow me your strokes. Together now. Low, high, low, low, high, low\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nSelmy took his simple supper out onto the queen\u2019s terrace that night and ate it as the sun went down. Through the purple twilight he watched fires waken one by one in the great stepped pyramids, as the many-colored bricks of Meereen faded to grey and then to black. Shadows gathered in the streets and alleys below, making pools and rivers. In the dusk, the city seemed a tranquil place, even beautiful. That is pestilence, not peace, the old knight told himself with his last sip of wine.\nHe did not wish to be conspicuous, so when he was finished with his supper he changed out of his court clothes, trading the white cloak of the Queensguard for a hooded brown traveler\u2019s cloak such as any common man might wear. He kept his sword and dagger. This could still be some trap. He had little trust in Hizdahr and less in Reznak mo Reznak. The perfumed seneschal could well be part of this, trying to lure him into a secret meeting so he could sweep up him and Skahaz both and charge them with conspiring against the king. If the Shavepate speaks treason, he will leave me no choice but to arrest him. Hizdahr is my queen\u2019s consort, however little I may like it. My duty is to him, not Skahaz.\nOr was it?\nThe first duty of the Kingsguard was to defend the king from harm or threat. The white knights were sworn to obey the king\u2019s commands as well, to keep his secrets, counsel him when counsel was requested and keep silent when it was not, serve his pleasure and defend his name and honor. Strictly speaking, it was purely the king\u2019s choice whether or not to extend Kingsguard protection to others, even those of royal blood. Some kings thought it right and proper to dispatch Kingsguard to serve and defend their wives and children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins of greater and lesser degree, and occasionally even their lovers, mistresses, and bastards. But others preferred to use household knights and men-at-arms for those purposes, whilst keeping their seven as their own personal guard, never far from their sides.\nIf the queen had commanded me to protect Hizdahr, I would have had no choice but to obey. But Daenerys Targaryen had never established a proper Queensguard even for herself nor issued any commands in respect to her consort. The world was simpler when I had a lord commander to decide such matters, Selmy reflected. Now I am the lord commander, and it is hard to know which path is right.\nWhen at last he came to the bottom of the last flight of steps, he found himself all but alone amongst the torchlit corridors inside the pyramid\u2019s massive brick walls. The great gates were closed and barred, as he had anticipated. Four Brazen Beasts stood guard outside those doors, four more within. It was those that the old knight encountered\u2014big men, masked as boar, bear, vole, and manticore.\n\u201cAll quiet, ser,\u201d the bear told him.\n\u201cKeep it so.\u201d It was not unknown for Ser Barristan to walk around at night, to make certain the pyramid was secure.\nDeeper inside the pyramid, another four Brazen Beasts had been set to guard the iron doors outside the pit where Viserion and Rhaegal were chained. The light of the torches shimmered off their masks\u2014ape, ram, wolf, crocodile.\n\u201cHave they been fed?\u201d Ser Barristan asked.\n\u201cAye, ser,\u201d replied the ape. \u201cA sheep apiece.\u201d\nAnd how long will that suffice, I wonder? As the dragons grew, so did their appetites.\nIt was time to find the Shavepate. Ser Barristan made his way past the elephants and the queen\u2019s silver mare, to the back of the stables. An ass nickered as he went by, and a few of the horses stirred at the light of his lantern. Elsewise all was dark and silent.\nThen a shadow detached itself from inside an empty stall and became another Brazen Beast, clad in pleated black skirt, greaves, and muscled breastplate. \u201cA cat?\u201d said Barristan Selmy when he saw the brass beneath the hood. When the Shavepate had commanded the Brazen Beasts, he had favored a serpent\u2019s-head mask, imperious and frightening.\n\u201cCats go everywhere,\u201d replied the familiar voice of Skahaz mo Kandaq. \u201cNo one ever looks at them.\u201d\n\u201cIf Hizdahr should learn that you are here\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho will tell him? Marghaz? Marghaz knows what I want him to know. The Beasts are still mine. Do not forget it.\u201d The Shavepate\u2019s voice was muffled by his mask, but Selmy could hear the anger in it. \u201cI have the poisoner.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cHizdahr\u2019s confectioner. His name would mean nothing to you. The man was just a catspaw. The Sons of the Harpy took his daughter and swore she would be returned unharmed once the queen was dead. Belwas and the dragon saved Daenerys. No one saved the girl. She was returned to her father in the black of night, in nine pieces. One for every year she lived.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Doubts gnawed at him. \u201cThe Sons had stopped their killing. Hizdahr\u2019s peace\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is a sham. Not at first, no. The Yunkai\u2019i were afraid of our queen, of her Unsullied, of her dragons. This land has known dragons before. Yurkhaz zo Yunzak had read his histories, he knew. Hizdahr as well. Why not a peace? Daenerys wanted it, they could see that. Wanted it too much. She should have marched to Astapor.\u201d Skahaz moved closer. \u201cThat was before. The pit changed all. Daenerys gone, Yurkhaz dead. In place of one old lion, a pack of jackals. Bloodbeard\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that one has no taste for peace. And there is more. Worse. Volantis has launched its fleet against us.\u201d\n\u201cVolantis.\u201d Selmy\u2019s sword hand tingled. We made a peace with Yunkai. Not with Volantis. \u201cYou are certain?\u201d\n\u201cCertain. The Wise Masters know. So do their friends. The Harpy, Reznak, Hizdahr. This king will open the city gates to the Volantenes when they arrive. All those Daenerys freed will be enslaved again. Even some who were never slaves will be fitted for chains. You may end your days in a fighting pit, old man. Khrazz will eat your heart.\u201d\nHis head was pounding. \u201cDaenerys must be told.\u201d\n\u201cFind her first.\u201d Skahaz grasped his forearm. His fingers felt like iron. \u201cWe cannot wait for her. I have spoken with the Free Brothers, the Mother\u2019s Men, the Stalwart Shields. They have no trust in Loraq. We must break the Yunkai\u2019i. But we need the Unsullied. Grey Worm will listen to you. Speak to him.\u201d\n\u201cTo what end?\u201d He is speaking treason. Conspiracy.\n\u201cLife.\u201d The Shavepate\u2019s eyes were black pools behind the brazen cat mask. \u201cWe must strike before the Volantenes arrive. Break the siege, kill the slaver lords, turn their sellswords. The Yunkai\u2019i do not expect an attack. I have spies in their camps. There\u2019s sickness, they say, worse every day. Discipline has gone to rot. The lords are drunk more oft than not, gorging themselves at feasts, telling each other of the riches they\u2019ll divide when Meereen falls, squabbling over primacy. Bloodbeard and the Tattered Prince despise each other. No one expects a fight. Not now. Hizdahr\u2019s peace has lulled us to sleep, they believe.\u201d\n\u201cDaenerys signed that peace,\u201d Ser Barristan said. \u201cIt is not for us to break it without her leave.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if she is dead?\u201d demanded Skahaz. \u201cWhat then, ser? I say she would want us to protect her city. Her children.\u201d\nHer children were the freedmen. Mhysa, they called her, all those whose chains she broke. \u201cMother.\u201d The Shavepate was not wrong. Daenerys would want her children protected. \u201cWhat of Hizdahr? He is still her consort. Her king. Her husband.\u201d\n\u201cHer poisoner.\u201d\nIs he? \u201cWhere is your proof?\u201d\n\u201cThe crown he wears is proof enough. The throne he sits. Open your eyes, old man. That is all he needed from Daenerys, all he ever wanted. Once he had it, why share the rule?\u201d\nWhy indeed? It had been so hot down in the pit. He could still see the air shimmering above the scarlet sands, smell the blood spilling from the men who\u2019d died for their amusement. And he could still hear Hizdahr, urging his queen to try the honeyed locusts. Those are very tasty\u00a0\u2026\u00a0sweet and hot\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet he never touched so much as one himself\u00a0\u2026 Selmy rubbed his temple. I swore no vows to Hizdahr zo Loraq. And if I had, he has cast me aside, just as Joffrey did. \u201cThis\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this confectioner, I want to question him myself. Alone.\u201d\n\u201cIs it that way?\u201d The Shavepate crossed his arms against his chest. \u201cDone, then. Question him as you like.\u201d\n\u201cIf\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if what he has to say convinces me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if I join with you in this, this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I would require your word that no harm would come to Hizdahr zo Loraq until\u00a0\u2026\u00a0unless\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it can be proved that he had some part in this.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care so much for Hizdahr, old man? If he is not the Harpy, he is the Harpy\u2019s firstborn son.\u201d\n\u201cAll I know for certain is that he is the queen\u2019s consort. I want your word on this, or I swear, I shall oppose you.\u201d\nSkahaz\u2019s smile was savage. \u201cMy word, then. No harm to Hizdahr till his guilt is proved. But when we have the proof, I mean to kill him with my own hands. I want to pull his entrails out and show them to him before I let him die.\u201d\nNo, the old knight thought. If Hizdahr conspired at my queen\u2019s death, I will see to him myself, but his death will be swift and clean. The gods of Westeros were far away, yet Ser Barristan Selmy paused for a moment to say a silent prayer, asking the Crone to light his way to wisdom. For the children, he told himself. For the city. For my queen.\n\u201cI will talk to Grey Worm,\u201d he said.",

      "content": "THE IRON SUITOR\nGrief appeared alone at daybreak, her black sails stark against the pale pink skies of morning.\nFifty-four, Victarion thought sourly when they woke him, and she sails alone. Silently he cursed the Storm God for his malice, his rage a black stone in his belly. Where are my ships?\nHe had set sail from the Shields with ninety-three, of the hundred that had once made up the Iron Fleet, a fleet belonging not to a single lord but to the Seastone Chair itself, captained and crewed by men from all the islands. Ships smaller than the great war dromonds of the green lands, aye, but thrice the size of any common longship, with deep hulls and savage rams, fit to meet the king\u2019s own fleets in battle.\nIn the Stepstones they had taken on grain and game and fresh water, after the long voyage along the bleak and barren coast of Dorne with its shoals and whirlpools. There, the Iron Victory had captured a fat merchant ship, the great cog Noble Lady, on her way to Oldtown by way of Gulltown, Duskendale, and King\u2019s Landing, with a cargo of salt cod, whale oil, and pickled herring. The food was a welcome addition to their stores. Five other prizes taken in the Redwyne Straights and along the Dornish coast\u2014three cogs, a galleas, and a galley\u2014had brought their numbers to ninety-nine.\nNine-and-ninety ships had left the Stepstones in three proud fleets, with orders to join up again off the southern tip of the Isle of Cedars. Forty-five had now arrived on the far side of the world. Twenty-two of Victarion\u2019s own had straggled in, by threes and fours, sometimes alone; fourteen of Ralf the Limper\u2019s; only nine of those that had sailed with Red Ralf Stonehouse. Red Ralf himself was amongst the missing. To their number the fleet had added nine new prizes taken on the seas, so the sum was fifty-four\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the captured ships were cogs and fishing boats, merchantmen and slavers, not warships. In battle, they would be poor substitutes for the lost ships of the Iron Fleet.\nThe last ship to appear had been the Maiden\u2019s Bane, three days previous. The day before that, three ships had come out of the south together\u2014his captive Noble Lady, lumbering along between Ravenfeeder and Iron Kiss. But the day before and the day before there had been nothing, and only Headless Jeyne and Fear before that, then two more days of empty seas and cloudless skies after Ralf the Limper appeared with the remnants of his squadron. Lord Quellon, White Widow, Lamentation, Woe, Leviathan, Iron Lady, Reaper\u2019s Wind, and Warhammer, with six more ships behind, two of them storm-wracked and under tow.\n\u201cStorms,\u201d Ralf the Limper had muttered when he came crawling to Victarion. \u201cThree big storms, and foul winds between. Red winds out of Valyria that smelled of ash and brimstone, and black winds that drove us toward that blighted shore. This voyage was cursed from the first. The Crow\u2019s Eye fears you, my lord, why else send you so far away? He does not mean for us to return.\u201d\nVictarion had thought the same when he met the first storm a day out of Old Volantis. The gods hate kinslayers, he brooded, elsewise Euron Crow\u2019s Eye would have died a dozen deaths by my hand. As the sea crashed around him and the deck rose and fell beneath his feet, he had seen Dagon\u2019s Feast and Red Tide slammed together so violently that both exploded into splinters. My brother\u2019s work, he\u2019d thought. Those were the first two ships he\u2019d lost from his own third of the fleet. But not the last.\nSo he had slapped the Limper twice across the face and said, \u201cThe first is for the ships you lost, the second for your talk of curses. Speak of that again and I will nail your tongue to the mast. If the Crow\u2019s Eye can make mutes, so can I.\u201d The throb of pain in his left hand made the words harsher than they might have been elsewise, but he meant what he said. \u201cMore ships will come. The storms are done for now. I will have my fleet.\u201d\nA monkey on the mast above howled derision, almost as if it could taste his frustration. Filthy, noisy beast. He could send a man up after it, but the monkeys seemed to like that game and had proved themselves more agile than his crew. The howls rang in his ears, though, and made the throbbing in his hand seem worse.\n\u201cFifty-four,\u201d he grumbled. It would have been too much to hope for the full strength of the Iron Fleet after a voyage of such length\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but seventy ships, even eighty, the Drowned God might have granted him that much. Would that we had the Damphair with us, or some other priest. Victarion had made sacrifice before setting sail, and again in the Stepstones when he split the fleet in three, but perhaps he had said the wrong prayers. That, or the Drowned God has no power here. More and more, he had come to fear that they had sailed too far, into strange seas where even the gods were queer\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but such doubts he confided only to his dusky woman, who had no tongue to repeat them.\nWhen Grief appeared, Victarion summoned Wulfe One-Ear. \u201cI will want words with the Vole. Send word to Ralf the Limper, Bloodless Tom, and the Black Shepherd. All hunting parties are to be recalled, the shore camps broken up by first light. Load as much fruit as can be gathered and drive the pigs aboard the ships. We can slaughter them at need. Shark is to remain here to tell any stragglers where we\u2019ve gone.\u201d She would need that long to make repairs; the storms had left her little more than a hulk. That would bring them down to fifty-three, but there was no help for it. \u201cThe fleet departs upon the morrow, on the evening tide.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command,\u201d said Wulfe, \u201cbut another day might mean another ship, lord Captain.\u201d\n\u201cAye. And ten days might mean ten ships, or none at all. We have squandered too many days waiting on the sight of sails. Our victory will be that much the sweeter if we win it with a smaller fleet.\u201d And I must needs reach the dragon queen before the Volantenes.\nIn Volantis he had seen the galleys taking on provisions. The whole city had seemed drunk. Sailors and soldiers and tinkers had been observed dancing in the streets with nobles and fat merchants, and in every inn and winesink cups were being raised to the new triarchs. All the talk had been of the gold and gems and slaves that would flood into Volantis once the dragon queen was dead. One day of such reports was all that Victarion Greyjoy could stomach; he paid the gold price for food and water, though it shamed him, and took his ships back out to sea.\nThe storms would have scattered and delayed the Volantenes, even as they had his own ships. If fortune smiled, many of their warships might have sunk or run aground. But not all. No god was that good, and those green galleys that survived by now could well have sailed around Valyria. They will be sweeping north toward Meereen and Yunkai, great dromonds of war teeming with slave soldiers. If the Storm God spared them, by now they could be in the Gulf of Grief. Three hundred ships, perhaps as many as five hundred. Their allies were already off Meereen: Yunkishmen and Astapors, men from New Ghis and Qarth and Tolos and the Storm God knew where else, even Meereen\u2019s own warships, the ones that fled the city before its fall. Against all that, Victarion had four-and-fifty. Three-and-fifty, less the Shark.\nThe Crow\u2019s Eye had sailed halfway across the world, reaving and plundering from Qarth to Tall Trees Town, calling at unholy ports beyond where only madmen went. Euron had even braved the Smoking Sea and lived to tell of it. And that with only one ship. If he can mock the gods, so can I.\n\u201cAye, Captain,\u201d said Wulfe One-Ear. He was not half the man that Nute the Barber was, but the Crow\u2019s Eye had stolen Nute. By raising him to Lord of Oakenshield, his brother made Victarion\u2019s best man his own. \u201cIs it still to be Meereen?\u201d\n\u201cWhere else? The dragon queen awaits me in Meereen.\u201d The fairest woman in the world if my brother could be believed. Her hair is silver-gold, her eyes are amethysts.\nWas it too much to hope that for once Euron had told it true? Perhaps. Like as not, the girl would prove to be some pock-faced slattern with teats slapping against her knees, her \u201cdragons\u201d no more than tattooed lizards from the swamps of Sothoryos. If she is all that Euron claims, though\u00a0\u2026 They had heard talk of the beauty of Daenerys Targaryen from the lips of pirates in the Stepstones and fat merchants in Old Volantis. It might be true. And Euron had not made Victarion a gift of her; the Crow\u2019s Eye meant to take her for himself. He sends me like a serving man to fetch her. How he will howl when I claim her for myself. Let the men mutter. They had sailed too far and lost too much for Victarion to turn west without his prize.\nThe iron captain closed his good hand into a fist. \u201cGo see that my commands are carried out. And find the maester wherever he is hiding and send him to my cabin.\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d Wulfe hobbled off.\nVictarion Greyjoy turned back toward the prow, his gaze sweeping across his fleet. Longships filled the sea, sails furled and oars shipped, floating at anchor or run up on the pale sand shore. The Isle of Cedars. Where were these cedars? Drowned four hundred years ago, it seemed. Victarion had gone ashore a dozen times, hunting fresh meat, and had yet to see a cedar.\nThe girlish maester Euron had inflicted upon him back in Westeros claimed this place had once been called \u2018the Isle of a Hundred Battles,\u2019 but the men who had fought those battles had all gone to dust centuries ago. The Isle of Monkeys, that\u2019s what they should call it. There were pigs as well: the biggest, blackest boars that any of the ironborn had ever seen and plenty of squealing piglets in the brush, bold creatures that had no fear of man. They were learning, though. The larders of the Iron Fleet were filling up with smoked hams, salted pork, and bacon.\nThe monkeys, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the monkeys were a plague. Victarion had forbidden his men to bring any of the demonic creatures aboard ship, yet somehow half his fleet was now infested with them, even his own Iron Victory. He could see some now, swinging from spar to spar and ship to ship. Would that I had a crossbow.\nVictarion did not like this sea, nor these endless cloudless skies, nor the blazing sun that beat down on their heads and baked the decks until the boards were hot enough to scorch bare feet. He did not like these storms, which seemed to come up out of nowhere. The seas around Pyke were often stormy, but there at least a man could smell them coming. These southron storms were as treacherous as women. Even the water was the wrong color\u2014a shimmering turquoise close to shore, and farther out a blue so deep that it was almost black. Victarion missed the grey-green waters of home, with their whitecaps and surges.\nHe did not like this Isle of Cedars either. The hunting might be good, but the forests were too green and still, full of twisted trees and queer bright flowers like none his men had ever seen before, and there were horrors lurking amongst the broken palaces and shattered statues of drowned Velos, half a league north of the point where the fleet lay at anchor. The last time Victarion had spent a night ashore, his dreams had been dark and disturbing and when he woke his mouth was full of blood. The maester said he had bitten his own tongue in his sleep, but he took it for a sign from the Drowned God, a warning that if he lingered here too long, he would choke on his own blood.\nOn the day the Doom came to Valyria, it was said, a wall of water three hundred feet high had descended on the island, drowning hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, leaving none to tell the tale but some fisherfolk who had been at sea and a handful of Velosi spearmen posted in a stout stone tower on the island\u2019s highest hill, who had seen the hills and valleys beneath them turn into a raging sea. Fair Velos with its palaces of cedar and pink marble had vanished in a heartbeat. On the north end of the island, the ancient brick walls and stepped pyramids of the slaver port Ghozai had suffered the same fate.\nSo many drowned men, the Drowned God will be strong there, Victarion had thought when he chose the island for the three parts of his fleet to join up again. He was no priest, though. What if he had gotten it backwards? Perhaps the Drowned God had destroyed the island in his wroth. His brother Aeron might have known, but the Damphair was back on the Iron Islands, preaching against the Crow\u2019s Eye and his rule. No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair. Yet the captains and kings had cried for Euron at the kingsmoot, choosing him above Victarion and other godly men.\nThe morning sun was shining off the water in ripples of light too bright to look upon. Victarion\u2019s head had begun to pound, though whether from the sun, his hand, or the doubts that troubled him, he could not say. He made his way below to his cabin, where the air was cool and dim. The dusky woman knew what he wanted without his even asking. As he eased himself into his chair, she took a soft damp cloth from the basin and laid it across his brow. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cGood. And now the hand.\u201d\nThe dusky woman made no reply. Euron had sliced her tongue out before giving her to him. Victarion did not doubt that the Crow\u2019s Eye had bedded her as well. That was his brother\u2019s way. Euron\u2019s gifts are poisoned, the captain had reminded himself the day the dusky woman came aboard. I want none of his leavings. He had decided then that he would slit her throat and toss her in the sea, a blood sacrifice to the Drowned God. Somehow, though, he had never quite gotten around to it.\nThey had come a long way since. Victarion could talk to the dusky woman. She never attempted to talk back. \u201cGrief is the last,\u201d he told her, as she eased his glove off. \u201cThe rest are lost or late or sunk.\u201d He grimaced as the woman slid the point of her knife beneath the soiled linen wound about his shield hand. \u201cSome will say I should not have split the fleet. Fools. Nine-and-ninety ships we had\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a cumbersome beast to shepherd across the seas to the far end of the world. If I\u2019d kept them together, the faster ships would have been held hostage to the slowest. And where to find provisions for so many mouths? No port wants so many warships in their waters. The storms would have scattered us, in any case. Like leaves strewn across the Summer Sea.\u201d\nInstead he had broken the great fleet into squadrons, and sent each by a different route to Slaver\u2019s Bay. The swiftest ships he gave to Red Ralf Stonehouse to sail the corsair\u2019s road along the northern coast of Sothoryos. The dead cities rotting on that fervid, sweltering shore were best avoided, every seamen knew, but in the mud-and-blood towns of the Basilisks Isles, teeming with escaped slaves, slavers, skinners, whores, hunters, brindled men, and worse, there were always provisions to be had for men who were not afraid to pay the iron price.\nThe larger, heavier, slower ships made for Lys, to sell the captives taken on the Shields, the women and children of Lord Hewett\u2019s Town and other islands, along with such men who decided they would sooner yield than die. Victarion had only contempt for such weaklings. Even so, the selling left a foul taste in his mouth. Taking a man as thrall or a woman as a salt wife, that was right and proper, but men were not goats or fowl to be bought and sold for gold. He was glad to leave the selling to Ralf the Limper, who would use the coin to load his big ships with provisions for the long slow middle passage east.\nHis own ships crept along the shores of the Disputed Lands to take on food and wine and fresh water at Volantis before swinging south around Valyria. That was the most common way east, and the one most heavily trafficked, with prizes for the taking and small islands where they could shelter during storms, make repairs, and renew their stores if need be.\n\u201cFour-and-fifty ships is too few,\u201d he told the dusky woman, \u201cbut I can wait no longer. The only way\u201d\u2014He grunted as she peeled the bandage off, tearing a crust of scab as well. The flesh beneath was green and black where the sword had sliced him.\u2014\u201cthe only way to do this is to take the slavers unawares, as once I did at Lannisport. Sweep in from the sea and smash them, then take the girl and race for home before the Volantenes descend upon us.\u201d Victarion was no craven, but no more was he a fool; he could not defeat three hundred ships with fifty-four. \u201cShe\u2019ll be my wife, and you will be her maid.\u201d A maid without a tongue could never let slip any secrets.\nHe might have said more, but that was when the maester came, rapping at the cabin door as timid as a mouse. \u201cEnter,\u201d Victarion called out, \u201cand bar the door. You know why you are here.\u201d\n\u201cLord Captain.\u201d The maester looked like a mouse as well, with his grey robes and little brown mustachio. Does he think that makes him look more manly? Kerwin was his name. He was very young, two-and-twenty maybe. \u201cMay I see your hand?\u201d he asked.\nA fool\u2019s question. Maesters had their uses, but Victarion had nothing but contempt for this Kerwin. With his smooth pink cheeks, soft hands, and brown curls, he looked more girlish than most girls. When first he came aboard the Iron Victory, he had a smirky little smile too, but one night off the Stepstones he had smiled at the wrong man, and Burton Humble had knocked out four of his teeth. Not long after that Kerwin had come creeping to the captain to complain that four of the crew had dragged him belowdecks and used him as a woman. \u201cHere is how you put an end to that,\u201d Victarion had told him, slamming a dagger down on the table between them. Kerwin took the blade\u2014too afraid to refuse it, the captain judged\u2014but he had never used it.\n\u201cMy hand is here,\u201d Victarion said. \u201cLook all you like.\u201d\nMaester Kerwin went down to one knee, the better to inspect the wound. He even sniffed at it, like a dog. \u201cI will need to let the pus again. The color\u00a0\u2026\u00a0lord Captain, the cut is not healing. It may be that I will need to take your hand.\u201d\nThey had talked of this before. \u201cIf you take my hand, I will kill you. But first I will tie you over the rail and make the crew a gift of your arse. Get on with it.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be pain.\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d Life is pain, you fool. There is no joy but in the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls. \u201cDo it.\u201d\nThe boy\u2014it was hard to think of one so soft and pink as a man\u2014laid the edge of the dagger across the captain\u2019s palm and slashed. The pus that burst forth was thick and yellow as sour milk. The dusky woman wrinkled her nose at the smell, the maester gagged, and even Victarion himself felt his stomach churn. \u201cCut deeper. Get it all. Show me the blood.\u201d\nMaester Kerwin pressed the dagger deep. This time it hurt, but blood welled up as well as pus, blood so dark that it looked black in the lantern light.\nBlood was good. Victarion grunted in approval. He sat there unflinching as the maester dabbed and squeezed and cleaned the pus away with squares of soft cloth boiled in vinegar. By the time he finished, the clean water in his basin had become a scummy soup. The sight alone would sicken any man. \u201cTake that filth and go.\u201d Victarion nodded at the dusky woman. \u201cShe can bind me up.\u201d\nEven after the boy had fled, the stink remained. Of late, there was no escaping it. The maester had suggested that the wound might best be drained up on deck, amidst fresh air and sunlight, but Victarion forbade it. This was not something that his crew could see. They were half a world away from home, too far to let them see that their iron captain had begun to rust.\nHis left hand still throbbed\u2014a dull pain, but persistent. When he closed his hand into a fist it sharpened, as if a knife were stabbing up his arm. Not a knife, a longsword. A longsword in the hand of a ghost. Serry, that had been his name. A knight, and heir to Southshield. I killed him, but he stabs at me from beyond the grave. From the hot heart of whatever hell I sent him to, he thrusts his steel into my hand and twists.\nVictarion remembered the fight as if it had been yesterday. His shield had been in shards, hanging useless from his arm, so when Serry\u2019s longsword came flashing down he had reached up and caught it. The stripling had been stronger than he looked; his blade bit through the lobstered steel of the captain\u2019s gauntlet and the padded glove beneath into the meat of his palm. A scratch from a little kitten, Victarion told himself afterward. He had washed the cut, poured some boiled vinegar over it, bound it up, and thought little more of it, trusting that the pain would fade and the hand heal itself in time.\nInstead the wound had festered, until Victarion began to wonder whether Serry\u2019s blade had been poisoned. Why else would the cut refuse to heal? The thought made him rage. No true man killed with poison. At Moat Cailin the bog devils had loosed poisoned arrows at his men, but that was to be expected from such degraded creatures. Serry had been a knight, highborn. Poison was for cravens, women, and Dornishmen.\n\u201cIf not Serry, who?\u201d he asked the dusky woman. \u201cCould that mouse of a maester be doing this? Maesters know spells and other tricks. He might be using one to poison me, hoping I will let him cut my hand off.\u201d The more he thought on it, the more likely it seemed. \u201cThe Crow\u2019s Eye gave him to me, wretched creature that he is.\u201d Euron had taken Kerwin off Greenshield, where he had been in service to Lord Chester, tending his ravens and teaching his children, or perhaps the other away around. And how the mouse had squealed when one of Euron\u2019s mutes delivered him aboard the Iron Victory, dragging him along by the convenient chain about his neck. \u201cIf this is his revenge, he wrongs me. It was Euron who insisted he be taken, to keep him from making mischief with his birds.\u201d His brother had given him three cages of ravens too, so Kerwin could send back word of their voyaging, but Victarion had forbidden him to loose them. Let the Crow\u2019s Eye stew and wonder.\nThe dusky woman was binding his hand with fresh linen, wrapping it six times around his palm, when Longwater Pyke came pounding at the cabin door to tell him that the captain of Grief had come aboard with a prisoner. \u201cSays he\u2019s brought us a wizard, Captain. Says he fished him from the sea.\u201d\n\u201cA wizard?\u201d Could the Drowned God have sent a gift to him, here on the far side of the world? His brother Aeron would have known, but Aeron had seen the majesty of the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls below the sea before being returned to life. Victarion had a healthy fear of his god, as all men should, but put his faith in steel. He flexed his wounded hand, grimacing, then pulled his glove on and rose. \u201cShow me this wizard.\u201d\nGrief\u2019s master awaited them on deck. A small man, as hairy as he was homely, he was a Sparr by birth. His men called him the Vole. \u201cLord Captain,\u201d he said when Victarion appeared, \u201cthis is Moqorro. A gift to us from the Drowned God.\u201d\nThe wizard was a monster of a man, as tall as Victarion himself and twice as wide, with a belly like a boulder and a tangle of bone-white hair that grew about his face like a lion\u2019s mane. His skin was black. Not the nut brown of the Summer Islanders on their swan ships, nor the red-brown of the Dothraki horselords, nor the charcoal-and-earth color of the dusky woman\u2019s skin, but black. Blacker than coal, blacker than jet, blacker than a raven\u2019s wing. Burned, Victarion thought, like a man who has been roasted in the flames until his flesh chars and crisps and falls smoking from his bones. The fires that had charred him still danced across his cheeks and forehead, where his eyes peered out from amongst a mask of frozen flames. Slave tattoos, the captain knew. Marks of evil.\n\u201cWe found him clinging to a broken spar,\u201d said the Vole. \u201cHe was ten days in the water after his ship went down.\u201d\n\u201cIf he were ten days in the water, he\u2019d be dead, or mad from drinking seawater.\u201d Salt water was holy; Aeron Damphair and other priests might bless men with it and swallow a mouthful or two from time to time to strengthen their faith, but no mortal man could drink of the deep sea for days at a time and hope to live. \u201cYou claim to be a sorcerer?\u201d Victarion asked the prisoner.\n\u201cNo, Captain,\u201d the black man answered in the Common Tongue. His voice was so deep it seemed to come from the bottom of the sea. \u201cI am but a humble slave of R\u2019hllor, the Lord of Light.\u201d\nR\u2019hllor. A red priest, then. Victarion had seen such men in foreign cities, tending their sacred fires. Those had worn rich red robes of silk and velvet and lambswool. This one was dressed in faded, salt-stained rags that clung to his thick legs and hung about his torso in tatters\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but when the captain peered at the rags more closely, it did appear as if they might once have been red. \u201cA pink priest,\u201d Victarion announced.\n\u201cA demon priest,\u201d said Wulfe One-Ear. He spat.\n\u201cMight be his robes caught fire, so he jumped overboard to put them out,\u201d suggested Longwater Pyke, to general laughter. Even the monkeys were amused. They chattered overhead, and one flung down a handful of his own shit to spatter on the boards.\nVictarion Greyjoy mistrusted laughter. The sound of it always left him with the uneasy feeling that he was the butt of some jape he did not understand. Euron Crow\u2019s Eye had oft made mock of him when they were boys. So had Aeron, before he had become the Damphair. Their mockery oft came disguised as praise, and sometimes Victarion had not even realized he was being mocked. Not until he heard the laughter. Then came the anger, boiling up in the back of his throat until he was like to choke upon the taste. That was how he felt about the monkeys. Their antics never brought so much as a smile to the captain\u2019s face, though his crew would roar and hoot and whistle.\n\u201cSend him down to the Drowned God before he brings a curse upon us,\u201d urged Burton Humble.\n\u201cA ship gone down, and only him clinging to the wreckage,\u201d said Wulfe One-Ear. \u201cWhere\u2019s the crew? Did he call down demons to devour them? What happened to this ship?\u201d\n\u201cA storm.\u201d Moqorro crossed his arms against his chest. He did not appear frightened, though all around him men were calling for his death. Even the monkeys did not seem to like this wizard. They leapt from line to line overhead, screaming.\nVictarion was uncertain. He came out of the sea. Why would the Drowned God cast him up unless he meant for us to find him? His brother Euron had his pet wizards. Perhaps the Drowned God meant for Victarion to have one too. \u201cWhy do you say this man is a wizard?\u201d he asked the Vole. \u201cI see only a ragged red priest.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the same, lord Captain\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but he knows things. He knew that we made for Slaver\u2019s Bay before any man could tell him, and he knew you would be here, off this island.\u201d The small man hesitated. \u201cLord Captain, he told me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he told me you would surely die unless we brought him to you.\u201d\n\u201cThat I would die?\u201d Victarion snorted. Cut his throat and throw him in the sea, he was about to say, until a throb of pain in his bad hand went stabbing up his arm almost to the elbow, the agony so intense that his words turned to bile in his throat. He stumbled and seized the rail to keep from falling.\n\u201cThe sorcerer\u2019s cursed the captain,\u201d a voice said.\nOther men took up the cry. \u201cCut his throat! Kill him before he calls his demons down on us!\u201d Longwater Pyke was the first to draw his dirk. \u201cNO!\u201d Victarion bellowed. \u201cStand back! All of you. Pyke, put up your steel. Vole, back to your ship. Humble, take the wizard to my cabin. The rest of you, about your duties.\u201d For half a heartbeat he was not certain they would obey. They stood about muttering, half with blades to hand, each looking to the others for resolve. Monkey shit rained down around them all, splat splat splat. No one moved until Victarion seized the sorcerer by the arm and pulled him to the hatchway.\nAs he opened the door to the captain\u2019s cabin, the dusky woman turned toward him, silent and smiling\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but when she saw the red priest at his side her lips drew back from her teeth, and she hisssssed in sudden fury, like a snake. Victarion gave her the back of his good hand and knocked her to the deck. \u201cBe quiet, woman. Wine for both of us.\u201d He turned to the black man. \u201cDid the Vole speak true? You saw my death?\u201d\n\u201cThat, and more.\u201d\n\u201cWhere? When? Will I die in battle?\u201d His good hand opened and closed. \u201cIf you lie to me, I will split your head open like a melon and let the monkeys eat your brains.\u201d\n\u201cYour death is with us now, my lord. Give me your hand.\u201d\n\u201cMy hand. What do you know of my hand?\u201d\n\u201cI have seen you in the nightfires, Victarion Greyjoy. You come striding through the flames stern and fierce, your great axe dripping blood, blind to the tentacles that grasp you at wrist and neck and ankle, the black strings that make you dance.\u201d\n\u201cDance?\u201d Victarion bristled. \u201cYour nightfires lie. I was not made for dancing, and I am no man\u2019s puppet.\u201d He yanked off his glove and shoved his bad hand at the priest\u2019s face. \u201cHere. Is this what you wanted?\u201d The new linen was already discolored by blood and pus. \u201cHe had a rose on his shield, the man who gave this to me. I scratched my hand on a thorn.\u201d\n\u201cEven the smallest scratch can prove mortal, lord Captain, but if you will allow me, I will heal this. I will need a blade. Silver would be best, but iron will serve. A brazier as well. I must needs light a fire. There will be pain. Terrible pain, such as you have never known. But when we are done, your hand will be returned to you.\u201d\nThey are all the same, these magic men. The mouse warned me of pain as well. \u201cI am ironborn, priest. I laugh at pain. You will have what you require\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if you fail, and my hand is not healed, I will cut your throat myself and give you to the sea.\u201d\nMoqorro bowed, his dark eyes shining. \u201cSo be it.\u201d\nThe iron captain was not seen again that day, but as the hours passed the crew of his Iron Victory reported hearing the sound of wild laughter coming from the captain\u2019s cabin, laughter deep and dark and mad, and when Longwater Pyke and Wulfe One-Eye tried the cabin door they found it barred. Later singing was heard, a strange high wailing song in a tongue the maester said was High Valyrian. That was when the monkeys left the ship, screeching as they leapt into the water.\nCome sunset, as the sea turned black as ink and the swollen sun tinted the sky a deep and bloody red, Victarion came back on deck. He was naked from the waist up, his left arm blood to the elbow. As his crew gathered, whispering and trading glances, he raised a charred and blackened hand. Wisps of dark smoke rose from his fingers as he pointed at the maester. \u201cThat one. Cut his throat and throw him in the sea, and the winds will favor us all the way to Meereen.\u201d Moqorro had seen that in his fires. He had seen the wench wed too, but what of it? She would not be the first woman Victarion Greyjoy had made a widow.",

      "content": "TYRION\nThe healer entered the tent murmuring pleasantries, but one sniff of the foul air and a glance at Yezzan zo Qaggaz put an end to that. \u201cThe pale mare,\u201d the man told Sweets.\nWhat a surprise, Tyrion thought. Who could have guessed? Aside from any man with a nose and me with half of one. Yezzan was burning with fever, squirming fitfully in a pool of his own excrement. His shit had turned to brown slime streaked with blood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and it fell to Yollo and Penny to wipe his yellow bottom clean. Even with assistance, their master could not lift his own weight; it took all his failing strength to roll onto one side.\n\u201cMy arts will not avail here,\u201d the healer announced. \u201cThe noble Yezzan\u2019s life is in the hands of the gods. Keep him cool if you can. Some say that helps. Bring him water.\u201d Those afflicted by the pale mare were always thirsty, drinking gallons between their shits. \u201cClean fresh water, as much as he will drink.\u201d\n\u201cNot river water,\u201d said Sweets.\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d And with that, the healer fled.\nWe need to flee as well, thought Tyrion. He was a slave in a golden collar, with little bells that tinkled cheerfully with every step he took. One of Yezzan\u2019s special treasures. An honor indistinguishable from a death warrant. Yezzan zo Qaggaz liked to keep his darlings close, so it had fallen to Yollo and Penny and Sweets and his other treasures to attend him when he grew sick.\nPoor old Yezzan. The lord of suet was not so bad as masters went. Sweets had been right about that. Serving at his nightly banquets, Tyrion had soon learned that Yezzan stood foremost amongst those Yunkish lords who favored honoring the peace with Meereen. Most of the others were only biding their time, waiting for the armies of Volantis to arrive. A few wanted to assault the city immediately, lest the Volantenes rob them of their glory and the best part of the plunder. Yezzan would have no part of that. Nor would he consent to returning Meereen\u2019s hostages by way of trebuchet, as the sellsword Bloodbeard had proposed.\nBut much and more can change in two days. Two days ago Nurse had been hale and healthy. Two days ago Yezzan had not heard the pale mare\u2019s ghostly hoofbeats. Two days ago the fleets of Old Volantis had been two days farther off. And now\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cIs Yezzan going to die?\u201d Penny asked, in that please-say-it-is-not-so voice of hers.\n\u201cWe are all going to die.\u201d\n\u201cOf the flux, I meant.\u201d\nSweets gave them both a desperate look. \u201cYezzan must not die.\u201d The hermaphrodite stroked the brow of their gargantuan master, pushing back his sweat-damp hair. The Yunkishman moaned, and another flood of brown water gushed down his legs. His bedding was stained and stinking, but they had no way to move him.\n\u201cSome masters free their slaves when they die,\u201d said Penny.\nSweets tittered. It was a ghastly sound. \u201cOnly favorites. They free them from the woes of the world, to accompany their beloved master to the grave and serve him in the afterlife.\u201d\nSweets should know. His will be the first throat slit.\nThe goat boy spoke up. \u201cThe silver queen\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is dead,\u201d insisted Sweets. \u201cForget her! The dragon took her across the river. She\u2019s drowned in that Dothraki sea.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t drown in grass,\u201d the goat boy said.\n\u201cIf we were free,\u201d said Penny, \u201cwe could find the queen. Or go search for her, at least.\u201d\nYou on your dog and me on my sow, chasing a dragon across the Dothraki sea. Tyrion scratched his scar to keep from laughing. \u201cThis particular dragon has already evinced a fondness for roast pork. And roast dwarf is twice as tasty.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just a wish,\u201d said Penny wistfully. \u201cWe could sail away. There are ships again, now that the war is over.\u201d\nIs it? Tyrion was inclined to doubt that. Parchments had been signed, but wars were not fought on parchments.\n\u201cWe could sail to Qarth,\u201d Penny went on. \u201cThe streets are paved with jade there, my brother always said. The city walls are one of the wonders of the world. When we perform in Qarth, gold and silver will rain down on us, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cSome of those ships out on the bay are Qartheen,\u201d Tyrion reminded her. \u201cLomas Longstrider saw the walls of Qarth. His books suffice for me. I have gone as far east as I intend to go.\u201d\nSweets dabbed at Yezzan\u2019s fevered face with a damp cloth. \u201cYezzan must live. Or we all die with him. The pale mare does not carry off every rider. The master will recover.\u201d\nThat was a bald-faced lie. It would be a wonder if Yezzan lived another day. The lord of suet was already dying from whatever hideous disease he had brought back from Sothoryos, it seemed to Tyrion. This would just hasten his end. A mercy, really. But not the sort the dwarf craved for himself. \u201cThe healer said he needs fresh water. We will see to that.\u201d\n\u201cThat is good of you.\u201d Sweets sounded numb. It was more than just fear of having her throat cut; alone amongst Yezzan\u2019s treasures, she actually seemed fond of their immense master.\n\u201cPenny, come with me.\u201d Tyrion opened the tent flap and ushered her out into the heat of a Meereenese morning. The air was muggy and oppressive, yet still a welcome relief from the miasma of sweat, shit, and sickness that filled the inside of Yezzan\u2019s palatial pavilion.\n\u201cWater will help the master,\u201d Penny said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the healer said, it must be so. Sweet fresh water.\u201d\n\u201cSweet fresh water didn\u2019t help Nurse.\u201d Poor old Nurse. Yezzan\u2019s soldiers had tossed him onto the corpse wagon last night at dusk, another victim of the pale mare. When men are dying every hour, no one looks too hard at one more dead man, especially one as well despised as Nurse. Yezzan\u2019s other slaves had refused to go near the overseer once the cramps began, so it was left to Tyrion to keep him warm and bring him drinks. Watered wine and lemonsweet and some nice hot dogtail soup, with slivers of mushroom in the broth. Drink it down, Nursey, that shitwater squirting from your arse needs to be replaced. The last word Nurse ever said was, \u201cNo.\u201d The last words he ever heard were, \u201cA Lannister always pays his debts.\u201d\nTyrion had kept the truth of that from Penny, but she needed to understand how things stood with their master. \u201cIf Yezzan lives to see the sunrise, I\u2019ll be stunned.\u201d\nShe clutched his arm. \u201cWhat will happen to us?\u201d\n\u201cHe has heirs. Nephews.\u201d Four such had come with Yezzan from Yunkai to command his slave soldiers. One was dead, slain by Targaryen sellswords during a sortie. The other three would divide the yellow enormity\u2019s slaves amongst them, like as not. Whether any of the nephews shared Yezzan\u2019s fondness for cripples, freaks, and grotesques was far less certain. \u201cOne of them may inherit us. Or we could end up back on the auction block.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes got big. \u201cNot that. Please.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not a prospect I relish either.\u201d\nA few yards away, six of Yezzan\u2019s slave soldiers were squatting in the dust, throwing the bones and passing a wineskin from hand to hand. One was the serjeant called Scar, a black-tempered brute with a head as smooth as stone and the shoulders of an ox. Clever as an ox too, Tyrion recalled.\nHe waddled toward them. \u201cScar,\u201d he barked out, \u201cthe noble Yezzan has need of fresh, clean water. Take two men and bring back as many pails as you can carry. And be quick about it.\u201d\nThe soldiers broke off their game. Scar rose to his feet, brow beetling. \u201cWhat did you say, dwarf? Who do you think you are?\u201d\n\u201cYou know who I am. Yollo. One of our lord\u2019s treasures. Now do as I told you.\u201d\nThe soldiers laughed. \u201cGo on, Scar,\u201d one mocked, \u201cand be quick about it. Yezzan\u2019s monkey gave you a command.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not tell soldiers what to do,\u201d Scar said.\n\u201cSoldiers?\u201d Tyrion affected puzzlement. \u201cSlaves, is what I see. You wear a collar round your neck the same as me.\u201d\nThe savage backhand blow Scar dealt him knocked him to the ground and broke his lip. \u201cYezzan\u2019s collar. Not yours.\u201d\nTyrion wiped the blood from his split lip with the back of his hand. When he tried to rise, one leg went out from under him, and he stumbled back onto his knees. He needed Penny\u2019s help to regain his feet. \u201cSweets said the master must have water,\u201d he said in his best whine.\n\u201cSweets can go fuck himself. He\u2019s made for it. We don\u2019t take commands from that freak neither.\u201d\nNo, thought Tyrion. Even amongst slaves there were lords and peasants, as he had been quick to learn. The hermaphrodite had long been their master\u2019s special pet, indulged and favored, and the noble Yezzan\u2019s other slaves hated him for it.\nThe soldiers were accustomed to taking their commands from their masters and their overseer. But Nurse was dead and Yezzan too sick to name a successor. As for the three nephews, those brave free men had remembered urgent business elsewhere at the first sound of the pale mare\u2019s hooves.\n\u201cThe w-water,\u201d said Tyrion, cringing. \u201cNot river water, the healer said. Clean, fresh well water.\u201d\nScar grunted. \u201cYou go for it. And be quick about it.\u201d\n\u201cUs?\u201d Tyrion exchanged a hopeless glance with Penny. \u201cWater\u2019s heavy. We\u2019re not so strong as you. Can we\u00a0\u2026\u00a0can we take the mule cart?\u201d\n\u201cTake your legs.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to make a dozen trips.\u201d\n\u201cMake a hundred trips. It\u2019s no shit to me.\u201d\n\u201cJust the two of us\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we won\u2019t be able to carry all the water that the master needs.\u201d\n\u201cTake your bear,\u201d suggested Scar. \u201cFetching water is about all that one is good for.\u201d\nTyrion backed away. \u201cAs you say, master.\u201d\nScar grinned. Master. Oh, he liked that. \u201cMorgo, bring the keys. You fill the pails and come right back, dwarf. You know what happens to slaves who try to escape.\u201d\n\u201cBring the pails,\u201d Tyrion told Penny. He went off with the man Morgo to fetch Ser Jorah Mormont from his cage.\nThe knight had not adapted well to bondage. When called upon to play the bear and carry off the maiden fair, he had been sullen and uncooperative, shuffling lifelessly through his paces when he deigned to take part in their mummery at all. Though he had not attempted escape, nor offered violence to his captors, he would ignore their commands oft as not or reply with muttered curses. None of this had amused Nurse, who made his displeasure clear by confining Mormont in an iron cage and having him beaten every evening as the sun sank into Slaver\u2019s Bay. The knight absorbed the beatings silently; the only sounds were the muttered curses of the slaves who beat him and the dull thuds of their clubs pounding against Ser Jorah\u2019s bruised and battered flesh.\nThe man is a shell, Tyrion thought, the first time he saw the big knight beaten. I should have held my tongue and let Zahrina have him. It might have been a kinder fate than this.\nMormont emerged from the cramped confines of the cage bent and squinting, with both eyes blackened and his back crusty with dried blood. His face was so bruised and swollen that he hardly looked human. He was naked except for a breechclout, a filthy bit of yellow rag. \u201cYou\u2019re to help them carry water,\u201d Morgo told him.\nSer Jorah\u2019s only reply was a sullen stare. Some men would sooner die free than live a slave, I suppose. Tyrion was not stricken with that affliction himself, thankfully, but if Mormont murdered Morgo, the other slaves might not draw that distinction. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, before the knight did something brave and stupid. He waddled off and hoped Mormont would follow.\nThe gods were good for once. Mormont followed.\nTwo pails for Penny, two for Tyrion, and four for Ser Jorah, two in either hand. The nearest well was south and west of the Harridan, so they set off in that direction, the bells on their collars ringing merrily with every step. No one paid them any mind. They were just slaves fetching water for their master. Wearing a collar conferred certain advantages, particularly a gilded collar inscribed with the name of Yezzan zo Qaggaz. The chime of those little bells proclaimed their value to anyone with ears. A slave was only as important as his master; Yezzan was the richest man in the Yellow City and had brought six hundred slave soldiers to the war, even if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and smell of piss. Their collars gave them leave to go anywhere they might wish within the camp.\nUntil Yezzan dies.\nThe Clanker Lords had their slave soldiers drilling in the nearest field. The clatter of the chains that bound them made a harsh metallic music as they marched across the sand in lockstep and formed up with their long spears. Elsewhere teams of slaves were raising ramps of stone and sand beneath their mangonels and scorpions, angling them upward at the sky, the better to defend the camp should the black dragon return. It made the dwarf smile to see them sweating and cursing as they wrestled the heavy machines onto the inclines. Crossbows were much in evidence as well. Every other man seemed to be clutching one, with a quiverfull of bolts hanging from his hip.\nIf anyone had thought to ask him, Tyrion could have told them not to bother. Unless one of those long iron scorpion bolts chanced to find an eye, the queen\u2019s pet monster was not like to be brought down by such toys. Dragons are not so easy to kill as that. Tickle him with these and you\u2019ll only make him angry.\nThe eyes were where a dragon was most vulnerable. The eyes, and the brain behind them. Not the underbelly, as certain old tales would have it. The scales there were just as tough as those along a dragon\u2019s back and flanks. And not down the gullet either. That was madness. These would-be dragonslayers might as well try to quench a fire with a spear thrust. \u201cDeath comes out of the dragon\u2019s mouth,\u201d Septon Barth had written in his Unnatural History, \u201cbut death does not go in that way.\u201d\nFarther on, two legions from New Ghis were facing off shield wall to shield wall whilst serjeants in iron halfhelms with horsehair crests screamed commands in their own incomprehensible dialect. To the naked eye the Ghiscari looked more formidable than the Yunkish slave soldiers, but Tyrion nursed doubts. The legionaries might be armed and organized in the same manner as Unsullied\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the eunuchs knew no other life, whereas the Ghiscari were free citizens who served for three-year terms.\nThe line at the well stretched back a quarter mile.\nThere were only a handful of wells within a day\u2019s march of Meereen, so the wait was always long. Most of the Yunkish host drew their drinking water from the Skahazadhan, which Tyrion had known was a very bad idea even before the healer\u2019s warning. The clever ones took care to stay upstream of the latrines, but they were still downstream of the city.\nThe fact that there were any good wells at all within a day\u2019s march of the city only went to prove that Daenerys Targaryen was still an innocent where siegecraft was concerned. She should have poisoned every well. Then all the Yunkishmen would be drinking from the river. See how long their siege lasts then. That was what his lord father would have done, Tyrion did not doubt.\nEvery time they shuffled forward another place, the bells on their collars tinkled brightly. Such a happy sound, it makes me want to scoop out someone\u2019s eyeballs with a spoon. By now Griff and Duck and Haldon Halfmaester should be in Westeros with their young prince. I should be with them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no, I had to have a whore. Kinslaying was not enough, I needed cunt and wine to seal my ruin, and here I am on the wrong side of the world, wearing a slave collar with little golden bells to announce my coming. If I dance just right, maybe I can ring \u201cThe Rains of Castamere.\u201d\nThere was no better place to hear the latest news and rumors than around the well. \u201cI know what I saw,\u201d an old slave in a rusted iron collar was saying, as Tyrion and Penny shuffled along in the queue, \u201cand I saw that dragon ripping off arms and legs, tearing men in half, burning them down to ash and bones. People started running, trying to get out of that pit, but I come to see a show, and by all the gods of Ghis, I saw one. I was up in the purple, so I didn\u2019t think the dragon was like to trouble me.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen climbed onto the dragon\u2019s back and flew away,\u201d insisted a tall brown woman.\n\u201cShe tried,\u201d said the old man, \u201cbut she couldn\u2019t hold on. The crossbows wounded the dragon, and the queen was struck right between her sweet pink teats, I hear. That was when she fell. She died in the gutter, crushed beneath a wagon\u2019s wheels. I know a girl who knows a man who saw her die.\u201d\nIn this company, silence was the better part of wisdom, but Tyrion could not help himself. \u201cNo corpse was found,\u201d he said.\nThe old man frowned. \u201cWhat would you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cThey were there,\u201d said the brown woman. \u201cIt\u2019s them, the jousting dwarfs, the ones who tilted for the queen.\u201d\nThe old man squinted down as if seeing him and Penny for the first time. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones who rode the pigs.\u201d\nOur notoriety precedes us. Tyrion sketched a courtly bow, and refrained from pointing out that one of the pigs was really a dog. \u201cThe sow I ride is actually my sister. We have the same nose, could you tell? A wizard cast a spell on her, but if you give her a big wet kiss, she will turn into a beautiful woman. The pity is, once you get to know her, you\u2019ll want to kiss her again to turn her back.\u201d\nLaughter erupted all around them. Even the old man joined in. \u201cYou saw her, then,\u201d said the redheaded boy behind them. \u201cYou saw the queen. Is she as beautiful as they say?\u201d\nI saw a slender girl with silvery hair wrapped in a tokar, he might have told them. Her face was veiled, and I never got close enough for a good look. I was riding on a pig. Daenerys Targaryen had been seated in the owner\u2019s box beside her Ghiscari king, but Tyrion\u2019s eyes had been drawn to the knight in the white-and-gold armor behind her. Though his features were concealed, the dwarf would have known Barristan Selmy anywhere. Illyrio was right about that much, at least, he remembered thinking. Will Selmy know me, though? And what will he do if he does?\nHe had almost revealed himself then and there, but something stopped him\u2014caution, cowardice, instinct, call it what you will. He could not imagine Barristan the Bold greeting him with anything but hostility. Selmy had never approved of Jaime\u2019s presence in his precious Kingsguard. Before the rebellion, the old knight thought him too young and untried; afterward, he had been known to say that the Kingslayer should exchange that white cloak for a black one. And his own crimes were worse. Jaime had killed a madman. Tyrion had put a quarrel through the groin of his own sire, a man Ser Barristan had known and served for years. He might have chanced it all the same, but then Penny had landed a blow on his shield and the moment was gone, never to return.\n\u201cThe queen watched us tilt,\u201d Penny was telling the other slaves in line, \u201cbut that was the only time we saw her.\u201d\n\u201cYou must have seen the dragon,\u201d said the old man.\nWould that we had. The gods had not even vouchsafed him that much. As Daenerys Targaryen was taking wing, Nurse had been clapping irons round their ankles to make certain they would not attempt escape on their way back to their master. If the overseer had only taken his leave after delivering them to the abbatoir, or fled with the rest of the slavers when the dragon descended from the sky, the two dwarfs might have strolled away free. Or run away, more like, our little bells a-jingle.\n\u201cWas there a dragon?\u201d Tyrion said with a shrug. \u201cAll I know is that no dead queens were found.\u201d\nThe old man was not convinced. \u201cAh, they found corpses by the hundred. They dragged them inside the pit and burned them, though half was crisp already. Might be they didn\u2019t know her, burned and bloody and crushed. Might be they did but decided to say elsewise, to keep you slaves quiet.\u201d\n\u201cUs slaves?\u201d said the brown woman. \u201cYou wear a collar too.\u201d\n\u201cGhazdor\u2019s collar,\u201d the old man boasted. \u201cKnown him since we was born. I\u2019m almost like a brother to him. Slaves like you, sweepings out of Astapor and Yunkai, you whine about being free, but I wouldn\u2019t give the dragon queen my collar if she offered to suck my cock for it. Man has the right master, that\u2019s better.\u201d\nTyrion did not dispute him. The most insidious thing about bondage was how easy it was to grow accustomed to it. The life of most slaves was not all that different from the life of a serving man at Casterly Rock, it seemed to him. True, some slaveowners and their overseers were brutal and cruel, but the same was true of some Westerosi lords and their stewards and bailiffs. Most of the Yunkai\u2019i treated their chattels decently enough, so long as they did their jobs and caused no trouble\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and this old man in his rusted collar, with his fierce loyalty to Lord Wobblecheeks, his owner, was not at all atypical.\n\u201cGhazdor the Great-hearted?\u201d Tyrion said, sweetly. \u201cOur master Yezzan has often spoken of his wits.\u201d What Yezzan had actually said was on the order of, I have more wits in the left cheek of my arse than Ghazdor and his brothers have between them. He thought it prudent to omit the actual words.\nMidday had come and gone before he and Penny reached the well, where a scrawny one-legged slave was drawing water. He squinted at them suspiciously. \u201cNurse always comes for Yezzan\u2019s water, with four men and a mule cart.\u201d He dropped the bucket down the well once more. There was a soft splash. The one-legged man let the bucket fill, then began to draw it upward. His arms were sunburnt and peeling, scrawny to look at but all muscle.\n\u201cThe mule died,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cSo did Nurse, poor man. And now Yezzan himself has mounted the pale mare, and six of his soldiers have the shits. May I have two pails full?\u201d\n\u201cAs you like.\u201d That was the end of idle talk. Is that hoofbeats you hear? The lie about the soldiers got old one-leg moving much more quickly.\nThey started back, each of the dwarfs carrying two brim-full pails of sweet water and Ser Jorah with two pails in each hand. The day was growing hotter, the air as thick and wet as damp wool, and the pails seemed to grow heavier with every step. A long walk on short legs. Water sloshed from his pails with every stride, splashing round his legs, whilst his bells played a marching song. Had I known it would come to this, Father, I might have let you live. Half a mile east, a dark plume of smoke was rising where a tent had been set afire. Burning last night\u2019s dead. \u201cThis way,\u201d Tyrion said, jerking his head to the right.\nPenny gave him a puzzled look. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we came.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to breathe that smoke. It\u2019s full of malign humors.\u201d It was not a lie. Not entirely.\nPenny was soon puffing, struggling with the weight of her pails. \u201cI need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Tyrion set the pails of water on the ground, grateful for the halt. His legs were cramping badly, so he found himself a likely rock and sat on it to rub his thighs.\n\u201cI could do that for you,\u201d offered Penny.\n\u201cI know where the knots are.\u201d As fond as he had grown of the girl, it still made him uncomfortable when she touched him. He turned to Ser Jorah. \u201cA few more beatings and you\u2019ll be uglier than I am, Mormont. Tell me, is there any fight left in you?\u201d\nThe big knight raised two blackened eyes and looked at him as he might look at a bug. \u201cEnough to crack your neck, Imp.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tyrion picked up his pails. \u201cThis way, then.\u201d\nPenny wrinkled her brow. \u201cNo. It\u2019s to the left.\u201d She pointed. \u201cThat\u2019s the Harridan there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the Wicked Sister.\u201d Tyrion nodded in the other direction. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy way is quicker.\u201d He set off, his bells jingling. Penny would follow, he knew.\nSometimes he envied the girl all her pretty little dreams. She reminded him of Sansa Stark, the child bride he had wed and lost. Despite the horrors Penny had suffered, she remained somehow trusting. She should know better. She is older than Sansa. And she\u2019s a dwarf. She acts as if she has forgotten that, as if she were highborn and fair to look upon, instead of a slave in a grotesquerie. At night Tyrion would oft hear her praying. A waste of words. If there are gods to listen, they are monstrous gods who torment us for their sport. Who else would make a world like this, so full of bondage, blood, and pain? Who else would shape us as they have? Sometimes he wanted to slap her, shake her, scream at her, anything to wake her from her dreams. No one is going to save us, he wanted to scream at her. The worst is yet to come. Yet somehow he could never say the words. Instead of giving her a good hard crack across that ugly face of hers to knock the blinders from her eyes, he would find himself squeezing her shoulder or giving her a hug. Every touch a lie. I have paid her so much false coin that she half thinks she\u2019s rich.\nHe had even kept the truth of Daznak\u2019s Pit from her.\nLions. They were going to set lions on us. It would have been exquisitely ironic, that. Perhaps he would have had time for a short, bitter chortle before being torn apart.\nNo one ever told him the end that had been planned for them, not in so many words, but it had not been hard to puzzle out, down beneath the bricks of Daznak\u2019s Pit, in the hidden world below the seats, the dark domain of the pit fighters and the serving men who tended to them, quick and dead\u2014the cooks who fed them, the ironmongers who armed them, the barber-surgeons who bled them and shaved them and bound up their wounds, the whores who serviced them before and after fights, the corpse handlers who dragged the losers off the sands with chains and iron hooks.\nNurse\u2019s face had given Tyrion his first inkling. After their show, he and Penny had returned to the torchlit vault where the fighters gathered before and after their matches. Some sat sharpening their weapons; others sacrificed to queer gods, or dulled their nerves with milk of the poppy before going out to die. Those who\u2019d fought and won were dicing in a corner, laughing as only men who have just faced death and lived can laugh.\nNurse was paying out some silver to a pit man on a lost wager when he spied Penny leading Crunch. The confusion in his eyes was gone in half a heartbeat, but not before Tyrion grasped what it meant. Nurse did not expect us back. He had looked around at other faces. None of them expected us back. We were meant to die out there. The final piece fell into place when he overheard an animal trainer complaining loudly to the pitmaster. \u201cThe lions are hungry. Two days since they ate. I was told not to feed them, and I haven\u2019t. The queen should pay for meat.\u201d\n\u201cYou take that up with her the next time she holds court,\u201d the pitmaster threw back at him.\nEven now, Penny did not suspect. When she spoke about the pit, her chief worry was that more people had not laughed. They would have pissed themselves laughing if the lions had been loosed, Tyrion almost told her. Instead he\u2019d squeezed her shoulder.\nPenny came to a sudden halt. \u201cWe\u2019re going the wrong way.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d Tyrion lowered his pails to the ground. The handles had gouged deep grooves in his fingers. \u201cThose are the tents we want, there.\u201d\n\u201cThe Second Sons?\u201d A queer smile split Ser Jorah\u2019s face. \u201cIf you think to find help there, you don\u2019t know Brown Ben Plumm.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I do. Plumm and I have played five games of cyvasse. Brown Ben is shrewd, tenacious, not unintelligent\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but wary. He likes to let his opponent take the risks whilst he sits back and keeps his options open, reacting to the battle as it takes shape.\u201d\n\u201cBattle? What battle?\u201d Penny backed away from him. \u201cWe have to get back. The master needs clean water. If we take too long, we\u2019ll be whipped. And Pretty Pig and Crunch are there.\u201d\n\u201cSweets will see that they are taken care of,\u201d Tyrion lied. More like, Scar and his friends would soon be feasting on ham and bacon and a savory dog stew, but Penny did not need to hear that. \u201cNurse is dead and Yezzan\u2019s dying. It could be dark before anyone thinks to miss us. We will never have a better chance than now.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You know what they do when they catch slaves trying to escape. You know. Please. They\u2019ll never let us leave the camp.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t left the camp.\u201d Tyrion picked up his pails. He set off at a brisk waddle, never looking back. Mormont fell in beside him. After a moment he heard the sounds of Penny hurrying after him, down a sandy slope to a circle of ragged tents.\nThe first guard appeared as they neared the horse lines, a lean spearman whose maroon beard marked him as Tyroshi. \u201cWhat do we have here? And what have you got in those pails?\u201d\n\u201cWater,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cif it please you.\u201d\n\u201cBeer would please me better.\u201d A spearpoint pricked him in the back\u2014a second guard, come up behind them. Tyrion could hear King\u2019s Landing in his voice. Scum from Flea Bottom. \u201cYou lost, dwarf?\u201d the guard demanded.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to join your company.\u201d\nA pail slipped from Penny\u2019s grasp and overturned. Half the water had spilled before she could right it once again.\n\u201cWe got fools enough in this company. Why would we want three more?\u201d The Tyroshi flicked at Tyrion\u2019s collar with his spearpoint, ringing the little golden bell. \u201cA runaway slave is what I see. Three runaway slaves. Whose collar?\u201d\n\u201cThe Yellow Whale\u2019s.\u201d That from a third man, drawn by their voices\u2014a skinny stubble-jawed piece of work with teeth stained red from sourleaf. A serjeant, Tyrion knew, from the way the other two deferred to him. He had a hook where his right hand should have been. Bronn\u2019s meaner bastard shadow, or I\u2019m Baelor the Beloved. \u201cThese are the dwarfs Ben tried to buy,\u201d the serjeant told the spearmen, squinting, \u201cbut the big one\u00a0\u2026\u00a0best bring him too. All three.\u201d\nThe Tyroshi gestured with his spear. Tyrion moved along. The other sellsword\u2014a stripling, hardly more than a boy, with fuzz on his cheeks and hair the color of dirty straw\u2014scooped up Penny under one arm. \u201cOoh, mine has teats,\u201d he said, laughing. He slipped a hand under Penny\u2019s tunic, just to be sure.\n\u201cJust bring her,\u201d snapped the serjeant.\nThe stripling slung Penny over one shoulder. Tyrion went ahead as quick as his stunted legs would allow. He knew where they were going: the big tent on the far side of the fire pit, its painted canvas walls cracked and faded by years of sun and rain. A few sellswords turned to watch them pass, and a camp follower sniggered, but no one moved to interfere.\nWithin the tent, they found camp stools and a trestle table, a rack of spears and halberds, a floor covered with threadbare carpets in half a dozen clashing colors, and three officers. One was slim and elegant, with a pointed beard, a bravo\u2019s blade, and a slashed pink doublet. One was plump and balding, with ink stains on his fingers and a quill clutched in one hand.\nThe third was the man he sought. Tyrion bowed. \u201cCaptain.\u201d\n\u201cWe caught them creeping into camp.\u201d The stripling dumped Penny onto the carpet.\n\u201cRunaways,\u201d the Tyroshi declared. \u201cWith pails.\u201d\n\u201cPails?\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm. When no one ventured to explain, he said, \u201cBack to your posts, boys. And not a word o\u2019 this, to anyone.\u201d When they were gone, he smiled at Tyrion. \u201cCome for another game of cyvasse, Yollo?\u201d\n\u201cIf you wish. I do enjoy defeating you. I hear you\u2019re twice a turncloak, Plumm. A man after mine own heart.\u201d\nBrown Ben\u2019s smile never reached his eyes. He studied Tyrion as a man might study a talking snake. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\u201cTo make your dreams come true. You tried to buy us at auction. Then you tried to win us at cyvasse. Even when I had my nose, I was not so handsome as to provoke such passion\u00a0\u2026\u00a0save in one who happened to know my true worth. Well, here I am, free for the taking. Now be a friend, send for your smith, and get these collars off us. I\u2019m sick of tinkling when I tinkle.\u201d\n\u201cI want no trouble with your noble master.\u201d\n\u201cYezzan has more urgent matters to concern him than three missing slaves. He\u2019s riding the pale mare. And why should they think to look for us here? You have swords enough to discourage anyone who comes nosing round. A small risk for a great gain.\u201d\nThe jackanapes in the slashed pink doublet hissed. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought the sickness amongst us. Into our very tents.\u201d He turned to Ben Plumm. \u201cShall I cut his head off, Captain? We can toss the rest in a latrine pit.\u201d He drew a sword, a slender bravo\u2019s blade with a jeweled hilt.\n\u201cDo be careful with my head,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get any of my blood on you. Blood carries the disease. And you\u2019ll want to boil our clothes, or burn them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve a mind to burn them with you still in them, Yollo.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not my name. But you know that. You have known that since you first set eyes on me.\u201d\n\u201cMight be.\u201d\n\u201cI know you as well, my lord,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cYou\u2019re less purple and more brown than the Plumms at home, but unless your name\u2019s a lie, you\u2019re a westerman, by blood if not by birth. House Plumm is sworn to Casterly Rock, and as it happens I know a bit of its history. Your branch sprouted from a stone spit across the narrow sea, no doubt. A younger son of Viserys Plumm, I\u2019d wager. The queen\u2019s dragons were fond of you, were they not?\u201d\nThat seemed to amuse the sellsword. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cNo one. Most of the stories you hear about dragons are fodder for fools. Talking dragons, dragons hoarding gold and gems, dragons with four legs and bellies big as elephants, dragons riddling with sphinxes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0nonsense, all of it. But there are truths in the old books as well. Not only do I know that the queen\u2019s dragons took to you, but I know why.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother said my father had a drop of dragon blood.\u201d\n\u201cTwo drops. That, or a cock six feet long. You know that tale? I do. Now, you\u2019re a clever Plumm, so you know this head of mine is worth a lordship\u00a0\u2026\u00a0back in Westeros, half a world away. By the time you get it there, only bone and maggots will remain. My sweet sister will deny the head is mine and cheat you of the promised reward. You know how it is with queens. Fickle cunts, the lot of them, and Cersei is the worst.\u201d\nBrown Ben scratched at his beard. \u201cCould deliver you alive and wriggling, then. Or pop your head into a jar and pickle it.\u201d\n\u201cOr throw in with me. That\u2019s the wisest move.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI was born a second son. This company is my destiny.\u201d\n\u201cThe Second Sons have no place for mummers,\u201d the bravo in pink said scornfully. \u201cIt\u2019s fighters we need.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought you one.\u201d Tyrion jerked a thumb at Mormont.\n\u201cThat creature?\u201d The bravo laughed. \u201cAn ugly brute, but scars alone don\u2019t make a Second Son.\u201d\nTyrion rolled his mismatched eyes. \u201cLord Plumm, who are these two friends of yours? The pink one is annoying.\u201d\nThe bravo curled a lip, whilst the fellow with the quill chuckled at his insolence. But it was Jorah Mormont who supplied their names. \u201cInkpots is the company paymaster. The peacock calls himself Kasporio the Cunning, though Kasporio the Cunt would be more apt. A nasty piece of work.\u201d\nMormont\u2019s face might have been unrecognizable in its battered state, but his voice was unchanged. Kasporio gave him a startled look, whilst the wrinkles around Plumm\u2019s eyes crinkled in amusement. \u201cJorah Mormont? Is that you? Less proud than when you scampered off, though. Must we still call you ser?\u201d\nSer Jorah\u2019s swollen lips twisted into a grotesque grin. \u201cGive me a sword and you can call me what you like, Ben.\u201d\nKasporio edged backward. \u201cYou\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she sent you away\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI came back. Call me a fool.\u201d\nA fool in love. Tyrion cleared his throat. \u201cYou can talk of old times later\u00a0\u2026\u00a0after I am done explaining why my head would be of more use to you upon my shoulders. You will find, Lord Plumm, that I can be very generous to my friends. If you doubt me, ask Bronn. Ask Shagga, son of Dolf. Ask Timett, son of Timett.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who would they be?\u201d asked the man called Inkpots.\n\u201cGood men who pledged me their swords and prospered greatly by that service.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOh, very well, I lied about the \u2018good\u2019 part. They\u2019re bloodthirsty bastards, like you lot.\u201d\n\u201cMight be,\u201d said Brown Ben. \u201cOr might be you just made up some names. Shagga, did you say? Is that a woman\u2019s name?\u201d\n\u201cHis teats are big enough. Next time we meet I\u2019ll peek beneath his breeches to be sure. Is that a cyvasse set over there? Bring it out and we\u2019ll have that game. But first, I think, a cup of wine. My throat is dry as an old bone, and I can see that I have a deal of talking to do.\u201d",

      "content": "JON\nThat night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.\n\u201cStand fast,\u201d Jon Snow called. \u201cThrow them back.\u201d He stood atop the Wall, alone. \u201cFlame,\u201d he cried, \u201cfeed them flame,\u201d but there was no one to pay heed.\nThey are all gone. They have abandoned me.\nBurning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. \u201cSnow,\u201d an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. He slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she\u2019d appeared.\nThe world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. \u201cI am the Lord of Winterfell,\u201d Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled\u00a0\u2026\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and woke with a raven pecking at his chest. \u201cSnow,\u201d the bird cried. Jon swatted at it. The raven shrieked its displeasure and flapped up to a bedpost to glare down balefully at him through the predawn gloom.\nThe day had come. It was the hour of the wolf. Soon enough the sun would rise, and four thousand wildlings would come pouring through the Wall. Madness. Jon Snow ran his burned hand through his hair and wondered once again what he was doing. Once the gate was opened there would be no turning back. It should have been the Old Bear to treat with Tormund. It should have been Jaremy Rykker or Qhorin Halfhand or Denys Mallister or some other seasoned man. It should have been my uncle. It was too late for such misgivings, though. Every choice had its risks, every choice its consequences. He would play the game to its conclusion.\nHe rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont\u2019s raven muttered across the room. \u201cCorn,\u201d the bird said, and, \u201cKing,\u201d and, \u201cSnow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.\u201d That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.\nHe broke his fast in the cellar with his officers. Fried bread, fried eggs, blood sausages, and barley porridge made up the meal, washed down with thin yellow beer. As they ate they went over the preparations yet again. \u201cAll is in readiness,\u201d Bowen Marsh assured him. \u201cIf the wildlings uphold the terms of the bargain, all will go as you\u2019ve commanded.\u201d\nAnd if not, it may turn to blood and carnage. \u201cRemember,\u201d Jon said, \u201cTormund\u2019s people are hungry, cold, and fearful. Some of them hate us as much as some of you hate them. We are dancing on rotten ice here, them and us. One crack, and we all drown. If blood should be shed today, it had best not be one of us who strikes the first blow, or I swear by the old gods and the new that I will have the head of the man who strikes it.\u201d\nThey answered him with ayes and nods and muttered words, with \u201cAs you command,\u201d and \u201cIt will be done,\u201d and \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d And one by one they rose and buckled on their swords and donned their warm black cloaks and strode out into the cold.\nLast to leave the table was Dolorous Edd Tollett, who had come in during the night with six wagons from the Long Barrow. Whore\u2019s Barrow, the black brothers called the fortress now. Edd had been sent to gather up as many spearwives as his wagons would hold and bring them back to join their sisters.\nJon watched him mop up a runny yolk with a chunk of bread. It was strangely comforting to see Edd\u2019s dour face again. \u201cHow goes the restoration work?\u201d he asked his old steward.\n\u201cTen more years should do it,\u201d Tollett replied in his usual gloomy tone. \u201cPlace was overrun with rats when we moved in. The spearwives killed the nasty buggers. Now the place is overrun with spearwives. There\u2019s days I want the rats back.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you find serving under Iron Emmett?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cMostly it\u2019s Black Maris serving under him, m\u2019lord. Me, I have the mules. Nettles claims we\u2019re kin. It\u2019s true we have the same long face, but I\u2019m not near as stubborn. Anyway I never knew their mothers, on my honor.\u201d He finished the last of his eggs and sighed. \u201cI do like me a nice runny egg. If it please m\u2019lord, don\u2019t let the wildlings eat all our chickens.\u201d\nOut in the yard, the eastern sky had just begun to lighten. There was not a wisp of cloud in sight. \u201cWe have a good day for this, it would seem,\u201d Jon said. \u201cA bright day, warm and sunny.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall will weep. And winter almost on us. It\u2019s unnatural, m\u2019lord. A bad sign, you ask me.\u201d\nJon smiled. \u201cAnd if it were to snow?\u201d\n\u201cA worse sign.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of weather would you prefer?\u201d\n\u201cThe sort they keep indoors,\u201d said Dolorous Edd. \u201cIf it please m\u2019lord, I should get back to my mules. They miss me when I\u2019m gone. More than I can say for them spearwives.\u201d\nThey parted there, Tollett for the east road, where his wagons waited, Jon Snow for the stables. Satin had his horse saddled and bridled and waiting for him, a fiery grey courser with a mane as black and shiny as maester\u2019s ink. He was not the sort of mount that Jon would have chosen for a ranging, but on this morning all that mattered was that he look impressive, and for that the stallion was a perfect choice.\nHis tail was waiting too. Jon had never liked surrounding himself with guards, but today it seemed prudent to keep a few good men beside him. They made a grim display in their ringmail, iron halfhelms, and black cloaks, with tall spears in their hands and swords and daggers on their belts. For this Jon had passed over all the green boys and greybeards in his command, choosing eight men in their prime: Ty and Mully, Left Hand Lew, Big Liddle, Rory, Fulk the Flea, Garrett Greenspear. And Leathers, Castle Black\u2019s new master-at-arms, to show the free folk that even a man who had fought for Mance in the battle beneath the Wall could find a place of honor in the Night\u2019s Watch.\nA deep red blush had appeared in the east by the time they all assembled at the gate. The stars are going out, Jon thought. When next they reappeared, they would be shining down upon a world forever changed. A few queen\u2019s men stood watching from beside the embers of Lady Melisandre\u2019s nightfire. When Jon glanced at the King\u2019s Tower, he glimpsed a flash of red behind a window. Of Queen Selyse he saw no sign.\nIt was time. \u201cOpen the gate,\u201d Jon Snow said softly.\n\u201cOPEN THE GATE!\u201d Big Liddle roared. His voice was thunder.\nSeven hundred feet above, the sentries heard and raised their warhorns to their lips. The sound rang out, echoing off the Wall and out across the world. Ah\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200boo\u200booo\u200booo. One long blast. For a thousand years or more, that sound had meant rangers coming home. Today it meant something else. Today it called the free folk to their new homes.\nOn either end of the long tunnel, gates swung open and iron bars unlocked. Dawn light shimmered on the ice above, pink and gold and purple. Dolorous Edd had not been wrong. The Wall would soon be weeping. Gods grant it weeps alone.\nSatin led them underneath the ice, lighting the way through the gloom of the tunnel with an iron lantern. Jon followed, leading his horse. Then his guardsmen. After them came Bowen Marsh and his stewards, a score of them, every man assigned a task. Above, Ulmer of the Kingswood had the Wall. Two score of Castle Black\u2019s best bowmen stood with him, ready to respond to any trouble down below with a rain of arrows.\nNorth of the Wall, Tormund Giantsbane was waiting, mounted on a runty little garron that looked far too weedy to support his weight. His two remaining sons were with him, tall Toregg and young Dryn, along with three score warriors.\n\u201cHar!\u201d Tormund called. \u201cGuards, is it? Now where\u2019s the trust in that, crow?\u201d\n\u201cYou brought more men than I did.\u201d\n\u201cSo I did. Come here by me, lad. I want my folk to see you. I got thousands ne\u2019er saw a lord commander, grown men who were told as boys that your rangers would eat them if they didn\u2019t behave. They need to see you plain, a long-faced lad in an old black cloak. They need to learn that the Night\u2019s Watch is naught t\u2019be feared.\u201d\nThat is a lesson I would sooner they never learned. Jon peeled the glove off his burned hand, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled. Ghost came racing from the gate. Tormund\u2019s horse shied so hard that the wildling almost lost his saddle. \u201cNaught to be feared?\u201d Jon said. \u201cGhost, stay.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a black-hearted bastard, Lord Crow.\u201d Tormund Horn-Blower lifted his own warhorn to his lips. The sound of it echoed off the ice like rolling thunder, and the first of the free folk began to stream toward the gate.\nFrom dawn till dusk Jon watched the wildlings pass.\nThe hostages went first\u2014one hundred boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. \u201cYour blood price, Lord Crow,\u201d Tormund declared. \u201cI hope the wailing o\u2019 their poor mothers don\u2019t haunt your dreams at night.\u201d Some of the boys were led to the gate by a mother or a father, others by older siblings. More came alone. Fourteen- and fifteen-year-old boys were almost men, and did not want to be seen clinging to a woman\u2019s skirts.\nTwo stewards counted the boys as they went by, noting each name on long sheepskin scrolls. A third collected their valuables for the toll and wrote that down as well. The boys were going to a place that none had ever been before, to serve an order that had been the enemy of their kith and kin for thousands of years, yet Jon saw no tears, heard no wailing mothers. These are winter\u2019s people, he reminded himself. Tears freeze upon your cheeks where they come from. Not a single hostage balked or tried to slink away when his turn came to enter that gloomy tunnel.\nAlmost all the boys were thin, some past the point of gauntness, with spindly shanks and arms like twigs. That was no more than Jon expected. Elsewise they came in every shape and size and color. He saw tall boys and short boys, brown-haired boys and black-haired boys, honey blonds and strawberry blonds and redheads kissed by fire, like Ygritte. He saw boys with scars, boys with limps, boys with pockmarked faces. Many of the older boys had downy cheeks or wispy little mustachios, but there was one fellow with a beard as thick as Tormund\u2019s. Some dressed in fine soft furs, some in boiled leather and oddments of armor, more in wool and sealskins, a few in rags. One was naked. Many had weapons: sharpened spears, stone-headed mauls, knives made of bone or stone or dragonglass, spiked clubs, tanglenets, even here and there a rust-eaten old sword. The Hornfoot boys walked blithe and barefoot through the snowdrifts. Other lads had bear-paws on their boots and walked on top of the same drifts, never sinking through the crust. Six boys arrived on horses, two on mules. A pair of brothers turned up with a goat. The biggest hostage was six-and-a-half feet tall but had a baby\u2019s face; the smallest was a runty boy who claimed nine years but looked no more than six.\nOf special note were the sons of men of renown. Tormund took care to point them out as they went by. \u201cThe boy there is the son of Soren Shieldbreaker,\u201d he said of one tall lad. \u201cHim with the red hair, he\u2019s Gerrick Kingsblood\u2019s get. Comes o\u2019 the line o\u2019 Raymun Redbeard, to hear him tell it. The line o\u2019 Redbeard\u2019s little brother, you want it true.\u201d Two boys looked enough alike to be twins, but Tormund insisted they were cousins, born a year apart. \u201cOne was sired by Harle the Huntsman, t\u2019other by Harle the Handsome, both on the same woman. Fathers hate each other. I was you, I\u2019d send one to Eastwatch and t\u2019other to your Shadow Tower.\u201d\nOther hostages were named as sons of Howd Wanderer, of Brogg, of Devyn Sealskinner, Kyleg of the Wooden Ear, Morna White Mask, the Great Walrus\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cThe Great Walrus? Truly?\u201d\n\u201cThey have queer names along the Frozen Shore.\u201d\nThree hostages were sons of Alfyn Crowkiller, an infamous raider slain by Qhorin Halfhand. Or so Tormund insisted. \u201cThey do not look like brothers,\u201d Jon observed.\n\u201cHalf-brothers, born o\u2019 different mothers. Alfyn\u2019s member was a wee thing, even smaller than yours, but he was never shy with where he stuck it. Had a son in every village, that one.\u201d\nOf a certain runty rat-faced boy, Tormund said, \u201cThat one\u2019s a whelp of Varamyr Sixskins. You remember Varamyr, Lord Crow?\u201d\nHe did. \u201cThe skinchanger.\u201d\n\u201cAye, he was that. A vicious little runt besides. Dead now, like as not. No one\u2019s seen him since the battle.\u201d\nTwo of the boys were girls in disguise. When Jon saw them, he dispatched Rory and Big Liddle to bring them to him. One came meekly enough, the other kicking and biting. This could end badly. \u201cDo these two have famous fathers?\u201d\n\u201cHar! Them skinny things? Not likely. Picked by lot.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re girls.\u201d\n\u201cAre they?\u201d Tormund squinted at the pair of them from his saddle. \u201cMe and Lord Crow made a wager on which o\u2019 you has the biggest member. Pull them breeches down, give us a look.\u201d\nOne of the girls turned red. The other glared defiantly. \u201cYou leave us alone, Tormund Giantstink. You let us go.\u201d\n\u201cHar! You win, crow. Not a cock between \u2019em. The little one\u2019s got her a set o\u2019 balls, though. A spearwife in the making, her.\u201d He called to his own men. \u201cGo find them something girly to put on before Lord Snow wets his smallclothes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll need two boys to take their places.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Tormund scratched his beard. \u201cA hostage is a hostage, seems to me. That big sharp sword o\u2019 yours can snick a girl\u2019s head off as easy as a boy\u2019s. A father loves his daughters too. Well, most fathers.\u201d\nIt is not their fathers who concern me. \u201cDid Mance ever sing of Brave Danny Flint?\u201d\n\u201cNot as I recall. Who was he?\u201d\n\u201cA girl who dressed up like a boy to take the black. Her song is sad and pretty. What happened to her wasn\u2019t.\u201d In some versions of the song, her ghost still walked the Nightfort. \u201cI\u2019ll send the girls to Long Barrow.\u201d The only men there were Iron Emmett and Dolorous Edd, both of whom he trusted. That was not something he could say of all his brothers.\nThe wildling understood. \u201cNasty birds, you crows.\u201d He spat. \u201cTwo more boys, then. You\u2019ll have them.\u201d\nWhen nine-and-ninety hostages had shuffled by them to pass beneath the Wall, Tormund Giantsbane produced the last one. \u201cMy son Dryn. You\u2019ll see he\u2019s well taken care of, crow, or I\u2019ll cook your black liver up and eat it.\u201d\nJon gave the boy a close inspection. Bran\u2019s age, or the age he would have been if Theon had not killed him. Dryn had none of Bran\u2019s sweetness, though. He was a chunky boy, with short legs, thick arms, and a wide red face\u2014a miniature version of his father, with a shock of dark brown hair. \u201cHe\u2019ll serve as my own page,\u201d Jon promised Tormund.\n\u201cHear that, Dryn? See that you don\u2019t get above yourself.\u201d To Jon he said, \u201cHe\u2019ll need a good beating from time to time. Be careful o\u2019 his teeth, though. He bites.\u201d He reached down for his horn again, raised it, and blew another blast.\nThis time it was warriors who came forward. And not just one hundred of them. Five hundred, Jon Snow judged, as they moved out from beneath the trees, perhaps as many as a thousand. One in every ten of them came mounted but all of them came armed. Across their backs they bore round wicker shields covered with hides and boiled leather, displaying painted images of snakes and spiders, severed heads, bloody hammers, broken skulls, and demons. A few were clad in stolen steel, dinted oddments of armor looted from the corpses of fallen rangers. Others had armored themselves in bones, like Rattleshirt. All wore fur and leather.\nThere were spearwives with them, long hair streaming. Jon could not look at them without remembering Ygritte: the gleam of fire in her hair, the look on her face when she\u2019d disrobed for him in the grotto, the sound of her voice. \u201cYou know nothing, Jon Snow,\u201d she\u2019d told him a hundred times.\nIt is as true now as it was then. \u201cYou might have sent the women first,\u201d he said to Tormund. \u201cThe mothers and the maids.\u201d\nThe wildling gave him a shrewd look. \u201cAye, I might have. And you crows might decide to close that gate. A few fighters on t\u2019other side, well, that way the gate stays open, don\u2019t it?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI bought your bloody horse, Jon Snow. Don\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t count his teeth. Now don\u2019t you go thinking me and mine don\u2019t trust you. We trust you just as much as you trust us.\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou wanted warriors, didn\u2019t you? Well, there they are. Every one worth six o\u2019 your black crows.\u201d\nJon had to smile. \u201cSo long as they save those weapons for our common foe, I am content.\u201d\n\u201cGave you my word on it, didn\u2019t I? The word of Tormund Giantsbane. Strong as iron, \u2019tis.\u201d He turned and spat.\nAmongst the stream of warriors were the fathers of many of Jon\u2019s hostages. Some stared with cold dead eyes as they went by, fingering their sword hilts. Others smiled at him like long-lost kin, though a few of those smiles discomfited Jon Snow more than any glare. None knelt, but many gave him their oaths. \u201cWhat Tormund swore, I swear,\u201d declared black-haired Brogg, a man of few words. Soren Shieldbreaker bowed his head an inch and growled, \u201cSoren\u2019s axe is yours, Jon Snow, if ever you have need of such.\u201d Red-bearded Gerrick Kingsblood brought three daughters. \u201cThey will make fine wives, and give their husbands strong sons of royal blood,\u201d he boasted. \u201cLike their father, they are descended from Raymun Redbeard, who was King-Beyond-the-Wall.\u201d\nBlood meant little and less amongst the free folk, Jon knew. Ygritte had taught him that. Gerrick\u2019s daughters shared her same flame-red hair, though hers had been a tangle of curls and theirs hung long and straight. Kissed by fire. \u201cThree princesses, each lovelier than the last,\u201d he told their father. \u201cI will see that they are presented to the queen.\u201d Selyse Baratheon would take to these three better than she had to Val, he suspected; they were younger and considerably more cowed. Sweet enough to look at them, though their father seems a fool.\nHowd Wanderer swore his oath upon his sword, as nicked and pitted a piece of iron as Jon had ever seen. Devyn Sealskinner presented him with a sealskin hat, Harle the Huntsman with a bear-claw necklace. The warrior witch Morna removed her weirwood mask just long enough to kiss his gloved hand and swear to be his man or his woman, whichever he preferred. And on and on and on.\nAs they passed, each warrior stripped off his treasures and tossed them into one of the carts that the stewards had placed before the gate. Amber pendants, golden torques, jeweled daggers, silver brooches set with gemstones, bracelets, rings, niello cups and golden goblets, warhorns and drinking horns, a green jade comb, a necklace of freshwater pearls\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all yielded up and noted down by Bowen Marsh. One man surrendered a shirt of silver scales that had surely been made for some great lord. Another produced a broken sword with three sapphires in the hilt.\nAnd there were queerer things: a toy mammoth made of actual mammoth hair, an ivory phallus, a helm made from a unicorn\u2019s head, complete with horn. How much food such things would buy in the Free Cities, Jon Snow could not begin to say.\nAfter the riders came the men of the Frozen Shore. Jon watched a dozen of their big bone chariots roll past him one by one, clattering like Rattleshirt. Half still rolled as before; others had replaced their wheels with runners. They slid across the snowdrifts smoothly, where the wheeled chariots were foundering and sinking.\nThe dogs that drew the chariots were fearsome beasts, as big as direwolves. Their women were clad in sealskins, some with infants at their breasts. Older children shuffled along behind their mothers and looked up at Jon with eyes as dark and hard as the stones they clutched. Some of the men wore antlers on their hats, and some wore walrus tusks. The two sorts did not love each other, he soon gathered. A few thin reindeer brought up the rear, with the great dogs snapping at the heels of stragglers.\n\u201cBe wary o\u2019 that lot, Jon Snow,\u201d Tormund warned him. \u201cA savage folk. The men are bad, the women worse.\u201d He took a skin off his saddle and offered it up to Jon. \u201cHere. This will make them seem less fearsome, might be. And warm you for the night. No, go on, it\u2019s yours to keep. Drink deep.\u201d\nWithin was a mead so potent it made Jon\u2019s eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through his chest. He drank deep. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Tormund Giantsbabe. For a wildling.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than most, might be. Not so good as some.\u201d\nOn and on the wildlings came, as the sun crept across the bright blue sky. Just before midday, the movement stopped when an oxcart became jammed at a turn inside the tunnel. Jon Snow went to have a look for himself. The cart was now wedged solid. The men behind were threatening to hack it apart and butcher the ox where he stood, whilst the driver and his kin swore to kill them if they tried. With the help of Tormund and his son Toregg, Jon managed to keep the wildlings from coming to blood, but it took the best part of an hour before the way was opened again.\n\u201cYou need a bigger gate,\u201d Tormund complained to Jon with a sour look up at the sky, where a few clouds had blown in. \u201cToo bloody slow this way. Like sucking the Milkwater through a reed. Har. Would that I had the Horn of Joramun. I\u2019d give it a nice toot and we\u2019d climb through the rubble.\u201d\n\u201cMelisandre burned the Horn of Joramun.\u201d\n\u201cDid she?\u201d Tormund slapped his thigh and hooted. \u201cShe burned that fine big horn, aye. A bloody sin, I call it. A thousand years old, that was. We found it in a giant\u2019s grave, and no man o\u2019 us had ever seen a horn so big. That must have been why Mance got the notion to tell you it were Joramun\u2019s. He wanted you crows to think he had it in his power to blow your bloody Wall down about your knees. But we never found the true horn, not for all our digging. If we had, every kneeler in your Seven Kingdoms would have chunks o\u2019 ice to cool his wine all summer.\u201d\nJon turned in his saddle, frowning. And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth. That huge horn with its bands of old gold, incised with ancient runes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0had Mance Rayder lied to him, or was Tormund lying now? If Mance\u2019s horn was just a feint, where is the true horn?\nBy afternoon the sun had gone, and the day turned grey and gusty. \u201cA snow sky,\u201d Tormund announced grimly.\nOthers had seen the same omen in those flat white clouds. It seemed to spur them on to haste. Tempers began to fray. One man was stabbed when he tried to slip in ahead of others who had been hours in the column. Toregg wrenched the knife away from his attacker, dragged both men from the press, and sent them back to the wildling camp to start again.\n\u201cTormund,\u201d Jon said, as they watched four old women pull a cartful of children toward the gate, \u201ctell me of our foe. I would know all there is to know of the Others.\u201d\nThe wildling rubbed his mouth. \u201cNot here,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cnot this side o\u2019 your Wall.\u201d The old man glanced uneasily toward the trees in their white mantles. \u201cThey\u2019re never far, you know. They won\u2019t come out by day, not when that old sun\u2019s shining, but don\u2019t think that means they went away. Shadows never go away. Might be you don\u2019t see them, but they\u2019re always clinging to your heels.\u201d\n\u201cDid they trouble you on your way south?\u201d\n\u201cThey never came in force, if that\u2019s your meaning, but they were with us all the same, nibbling at our edges. We lost more outriders than I care to think about, and it was worth your life to fall behind or wander off. Every nightfall we\u2019d ring our camps with fire. They don\u2019t like fire much, and no mistake. When the snows came, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0snow and sleet and freezing rain, it\u2019s bloody hard to find dry wood or get your kindling lit, and the cold\u00a0\u2026\u00a0some nights our fires just seemed to shrivel up and die. Nights like that, you always find some dead come the morning. \u2018Less they find you first. The night that Torwynd\u00a0\u2026\u00a0my boy, he \u2026\u2019 Tormund turned his face away.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Jon Snow.\nTormund turned back. \u201cYou know nothing. You killed a dead man, aye, I heard. Mance killed a hundred. A man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how do you fight a mist, crow? Shadows with teeth\u00a0\u2026\u00a0air so cold it hurts to breathe, like a knife inside your chest\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you do not know, you cannot know\u00a0\u2026\u00a0can your sword cut cold?\u201d\nWe will see, Jon thought, remembering the things that Sam had told him, the things he\u2019d found in his old books. Longclaw had been forged in the fires of old Valyria, forged in dragonflame and set with spells. Dragonsteel, Sam called it. Stronger than any common steel, lighter, harder, sharper\u00a0\u2026 But words in a book were one thing. The true test came in battle.\n\u201cYou are not wrong,\u201d Jon said. \u201cI do not know. And if the gods are good, I never will.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods are seldom good, Jon Snow.\u201d Tormund nodded toward the sky. \u201cThe clouds roll in. Already it grows darker, colder. Your Wall no longer weeps. Look.\u201d He turned and called out to his son Toregg. \u201cRide back to the camp and get them moving. The sick ones and the weak ones, the slugabeds and cravens, get them on their bloody feet. Set their bloody tents afire if you must. The gate must close at nightfall. Any man not through the Wall by then had best pray the Others get to him afore I do. You hear?\u201d\n\u201cI hear.\u201d Toregg put his heels into his horse and galloped back down the column.\nOn and on the wildlings came. The day grew darker, just as Tormund said. Clouds covered the sky from horizon to horizon, and warmth fled. There was more shoving at the gate, as men and goats and bullocks jostled each other out of the way. It is more than impatience, Jon realized. They are afraid. Warriors, spearwives, raiders, they are frightened of those woods, of shadows moving through the trees. They want to put the Wall between them before the night descends.\nA snowflake danced upon the air. Then another. Dance with me, Jon Snow, he thought. You\u2019ll dance with me anon.\nOn and on and on the wildlings came. Some were moving faster now, hastening across the battleground. Others\u2014the old, the young, the feeble\u2014could scarce move at all. This morning the field had been covered with a thick blanket of old snow, its white crust shining in the sun. Now the field was brown and black and slimy. The passage of the free folk had turned the ground to mud and muck: wooden wheels and horses\u2019 hooves, runners of bone and horn and iron, pig trotters, heavy boots, the cloven feet of cows and bullocks, the bare black feet of the Hornfoot folk, all had left their marks. The soft footing slowed the column even more. \u201cYou need a bigger gate,\u201d Tormund complained again.\nBy late afternoon the snow was falling steadily, but the river of wildlings had dwindled to a stream. Columns of smoke rose from the trees where their camp had been. \u201cToregg,\u201d Tormund explained. \u201cBurning the dead. Always some who go to sleep and don\u2019t wake up. You find them in their tents, them as have tents, curled up and froze. Toregg knows what to do.\u201d\nThe stream was no more than a trickle by the time Toregg emerged from the wood. With him rode a dozen mounted warriors armed with spears and swords. \u201cMy rear guard,\u201d Tormund said, with a gap-toothed smile. \u201cYou crows have rangers. So do we. Them I left in camp in case we were attacked before we all got out.\u201d\n\u201cYour best men.\u201d\n\u201cOr my worst. Every man o\u2019 them has killed a crow.\u201d\nAmongst the riders came one man afoot, with some big beast trotting at his heels. A boar, Jon saw. A monstrous boar. Twice the size of Ghost, the creature was covered with coarse black hair, with tusks as long as a man\u2019s arm. Jon had never seen a boar so huge or ugly. The man beside him was no beauty either; hulking, black-browed, he had a flat nose, heavy jowls dark with stubble, small black close-set eyes.\n\u201cBorroq.\u201d Tormund turned his head and spat.\n\u201cA skinchanger.\u201d It was not a question. Somehow he knew.\nGhost turned his head. The falling snow had masked the boar\u2019s scent, but now the white wolf had the smell. He padded out in front of Jon, his teeth bared in a silent snarl.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jon snapped. \u201cGhost, down. Stay. Stay!\u201d\n\u201cBoars and wolves,\u201d said Tormund. \u201cBest keep that beast o\u2019 yours locked up tonight. I\u2019ll see that Borroq does the same with his pig.\u201d He glanced up at the darkening sky. \u201cThem\u2019s the last, and none too soon. It\u2019s going to snow all night, I feel it. Time I had a look at what\u2019s on t\u2019other side of all that ice.\u201d\n\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cI mean to be the last one through the ice. I will join you at the feast.\u201d\n\u201cFeast? Har! Now that\u2019s a word I like to hear.\u201d The wildling turned his garron toward the Wall and slapped her on the rump. Toregg and the riders followed, dismounting by the gate to lead their horses through. Bowen Marsh stayed long enough to supervise as his stewards pulled the last carts into the tunnel. Only Jon Snow and his guards were left.\nThe skinchanger stopped ten yards away. His monster pawed at the mud, snuffling. A light powdering of snow covered the boar\u2019s humped black back. He gave a snort and lowered his head, and for half a heartbeat Jon thought he was about to charge. To either side of him, his men lowered their spears.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Borroq said.\n\u201cYou\u2019d best go on. We are about to close the gate.\u201d\n\u201cYou do that,\u201d Borroq said. \u201cYou close it good and tight. They\u2019re coming, crow.\u201d He smiled as ugly a smile as Jon had ever seen and made his way to the gate. The boar stalked after him. The falling snow covered up their tracks behind them.\n\u201cThat\u2019s done, then,\u201d Rory said when they were gone.\nNo, thought Jon Snow, it has only just begun.\nBowen Marsh was waiting for him south of the Wall, with a tablet full of numbers. \u201cThree thousand one hundred and nineteen wildlings passed through the gate today,\u201d the Lord Steward told him. \u201cSixty of your hostages were sent off to Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower after they\u2019d been fed. Edd Tollett took six wagons of women back to Long Barrow. The rest remain with us.\u201d\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d Jon promised him. \u201cTormund means to lead his own folk to Oakenshield within a day or two. The rest will follow, as soon as we sort where to put them.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Lord Snow.\u201d The words were stiff. The tone suggested that Bowen Marsh knew where he would put them.\nThe castle Jon returned to was far different from the one he\u2019d left that morning. For as long as he had known it, Castle Black had been a place of silence and shadows, where a meagre company of men in black moved like ghosts amongst the ruins of a fortress that had once housed ten times their numbers. All that had changed. Lights now shone through windows where Jon Snow had never seen lights shine before. Strange voices echoed down the yards, and free folk were coming and going along icy paths that had only known the black boots of crows for years. Outside the old Flint Barracks, he came across a dozen men pelting one another with snow. Playing, Jon thought in astonishment, grown men playing like children, throwing snowballs the way Bran and Arya once did, and Robb and me before them.\nDonal Noye\u2019s old armory was still dark and silent, however, and Jon\u2019s rooms back of the cold forge were darker still. But he had no sooner taken off his cloak than Dannel poked his head through the door to announce that Clydas had brought a message.\n\u201cSend him in.\u201d Jon lit a taper from an ember in his brazier and three candles from the taper.\nClydas entered pink and blinking, the parchment clutched in one soft hand. \u201cBeg pardon, Lord Commander. I know you must be weary, but I thought you would want to see this at once.\u201d\n\u201cYou did well.\u201d Jon read:",

      "content": "THE DISCARDED KNIGHT\nAll kneel for His Magnificence Hizdahr zo Loraq, Fourteenth of That Noble Name, King of Meereen, Scion of Ghis, Octarch of the Old Empire, Master of the Skahazadhan, Consort to Dragons and Blood of the Harpy,\u201d roared the herald. His voice echoed off the marble floor and rang amongst the pillars.\nSer Barristan Selmy slipped a hand beneath the fold of his cloak and loosened his sword in its scabbard. No blades were allowed in the presence of the king save those of his protectors. It seemed as though he still counted amongst that number despite his dismissal. No one had tried to take his sword, at least.\nDaenerys Targaryen had preferred to hold court from a bench of polished ebony, smooth and simple, covered with the cushions that Ser Barristan had found to make her more comfortable. King Hizdahr had replaced the bench with two imposing thrones of gilded wood, their tall backs carved into the shape of dragons. The king seated himself in the right-hand throne with a golden crown upon his head and a jeweled sceptre in one pale hand. The second throne remained vacant.\nThe important throne, thought Ser Barristan. No dragon chair can replace a dragon no matter how elaborately it\u2019s carved.\nTo the right of the twin thrones stood Goghor the Giant, a huge hulk of a man with a brutal, scarred face. To the left was the Spotted Cat, a leopard skin flung over one shoulder. Back of them were Belaquo Bonebreaker and the cold-eyed Khrazz. Seasoned killers all, thought Selmy, but it is one thing to face a foe in the pit when his coming is heralded by horns and drums and another to find a hidden killer before he can strike.\nThe day was young and fresh, and yet he felt bone-tired, as if he\u2019d fought all night. The older he got, the less sleep Ser Barristan seemed to need. As a squire he could sleep ten hours a night and still be yawning when he stumbled out onto the practice yard. At three-and-sixty he found that five hours a night was more than enough. Last night, he had scarce slept at all. His bedchamber was a small cell off the queen\u2019s apartments, originally slave quarters; his furnishings consisted of a bed, a chamber pot, a wardrobe for his clothing, even a chair should he want to sit. On a bedside table he kept a beeswax candle and a small carving of the Warrior. Though he was not a pious man, the carving made him feel less alone here in this queer alien city, and it was to that he had turned in the black watches of night. Shield me from these doubts that gnaw at me, he had prayed, and give me the strength to do what is right. But neither prayer nor dawn had brought him certainty.\nThe hall was as crowded as the old knight had ever seen it, but it was the missing faces that Barristan Selmy noted most: Missandei, Belwas, Grey Worm, Aggo and Jhogo and Rakharo, Irri and Jhiqui, Daario Naharis. In the Shavepate\u2019s place stood a fat man in a muscled breastplate and lion\u2019s mask, his heavy legs poking out beneath a skirt of leather straps: Marghaz zo Loraq, the king\u2019s cousin, new commander of the Brazen Beasts. Selmy had already formed a healthy contempt for the man. He had known his sort in King\u2019s Landing\u2014fawning to his superiors, harsh to his inferiors, as blind as he was boastful and too proud by half.\nSkahaz could be in the hall as well, Selmy realized, that ugly face of his concealed behind a mask. Two score Brazen Beasts stood between the pillars, torchlight shining off the polished brass of their masks. The Shavepate could be any one of them.\nThe hall thrummed to the sound of a hundred low voices, echoing off the pillars and the marble floor. It made an ominous sound, angry. It reminded Selmy of the sound a hornets\u2019 nest might make an instant before hornets all came boiling out. And on the faces in the crowd he saw anger, grief, suspicion, fear.\nHardly had the king\u2019s new herald called the court to order than the ugliness began. One woman began to wail about a brother who had died at Daznak\u2019s Pit, another of the damage to her palanquin. A fat man tore off his bandages to show the court his burned arm, where the flesh was still raw and oozing. And when a man in a blue-and-gold tokar began to speak of Harghaz the Hero, a freedman behind him shoved him to the floor. It took six Brazen Beasts to pull them apart and drag them from the hall. Fox, hawk, seal, locust, lion, toad. Selmy wondered if the masks had meaning to the men who wore them. Did the same men wear the same masks every day, or did they choose new faces every morning?\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Reznak mo Reznak was pleading. \u201cPlease! I will answer if you will only\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d a freedwoman shouted. \u201cIs our mother dead?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Reznak screeched. \u201cQueen Daenerys will return to Meereen in her own time in all her might and majesty. Until such time, His Worship King Hizdahr shall\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe is no king of mine,\u201d a freedman yelled.\nMen began to shove at one another. \u201cThe queen is not dead,\u201d the seneschal proclaimed. \u201cHer bloodriders have been dispatched across the Skahazadhan to find Her Grace and return her to her loving lord and loyal subjects. Each has ten picked riders, and each man has three swift horses, so they may travel fast and far. Queen Daenerys shall be found.\u201d\nA tall Ghiscari in a brocade robe spoke next, in a voice as sonorous as it was cold. King Hizdahr shifted on his dragon throne, his face stony as he did his best to appear concerned but unperturbed. Once again his seneschal gave answer.\nSer Barristan let Reznak\u2019s oily words wash over him. His years in the Kingsguard had taught him the trick of listening without hearing, especially useful when the speaker was intent on proving that words were truly wind. Back at the rear of the hall, he spied the Dornish princeling and his two companions. They should not have come. Martell does not realize his danger. Daenerys was his only friend at this court, and she is gone. He wondered how much they understood of what was being said. Even he could not always make sense of the mongrel Ghiscari tongue the slavers spoke, especially when they were speaking fast.\nPrince Quentyn was listening intently, at least. That one is his father\u2019s son. Short and stocky, plain-faced, he seemed a decent lad, sober, sensible, dutiful\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not the sort to make a young girl\u2019s heart beat faster. And Daenerys Targaryen, whatever else she might be, was still a young girl, as she herself would claim when it pleased her to play the innocent. Like all good queens she put her people first\u2014else she would never have wed Hizdahr zo Loraq\u2014but the girl in her still yearned for poetry, passion, and laughter. She wants fire, and Dorne sent her mud.\nYou could make a poultice out of mud to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in mud and grow a crop to feed your children. Mud would nourish you, where fire would only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose fire every time.\nBehind the prince, Ser Gerris Drinkwater was whispering something to Yronwood. Ser Gerris was all his prince was not: tall and lean and comely, with a swordsman\u2019s grace and a courtier\u2019s wit. Selmy did not doubt that many a Dornish maiden had run her fingers through that sun-streaked hair and kissed that teasing smile off his lips. If this one had been the prince, things might have gone elsewise, he could not help but think\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but there was something a bit too pleasant about Drinkwater for his taste. False coin, the old knight thought. He had known such men before.\nWhatever he was whispering must have been amusing, for his big bald friend gave a sudden snort of laughter, loud enough so that the king himself turned his head toward the Dornishmen. When he saw the prince, Hizdahr zo Loraq frowned.\nSer Barristan did not like that frown. And when the king beckoned his cousin Marghaz closer, leaned down, and whispered in his ear, he liked that even less.\nI swore no oath to Dorne, Ser Barristan told himself. But Lewyn Martell had been his Sworn Brother, back in the days when the bonds between the Kingsguard still went deep. I could not help Prince Lewyn on the Trident, but I can help his nephew now. Martell was dancing in a vipers\u2019 nest, and he did not even see the snakes. His continued presence, even after Daenerys had given herself to another before the eyes of gods and men, would provoke any husband, and Quentyn no longer had the queen to shield him from Hizdahr\u2019s wroth. Although\u00a0\u2026\nThe thought hit him like a slap across the face. Quentyn had grown up amongst the courts of Dorne. Plots and poisons were no strangers to him. Nor was Prince Lewyn his only uncle. He is kin to the Red Viper. Daenerys had taken another for her consort, but if Hizdahr died, she would be free to wed again. Could the Shavepate have been wrong? Who can say that the locusts were meant for Daenerys? It was the king\u2019s own box. What if he was meant to be the victim all along? Hizdahr\u2019s death would have smashed the fragile peace. The Sons of the Harpy would have resumed their murders, the Yunkishmen their war. Daenerys might have had no better choice than Quentyn and his marriage pact.\nSer Barristan was still wrestling with that suspicion when he heard the sound of heavy boots ascending the steep stone steps at the back of the hall. The Yunkishmen had come. Three Wise Masters led the procession from the Yellow City, each with his own armed retinue. One slaver wore a tokar of maroon silk fringed with gold, one a striped tokar of teal and orange, the third an ornate breastplate inlaid with erotic scenes done in jet and jade and mother-of-pearl. The sellsword captain Bloodbeard accompanied them with a leathern sack slung across one massive shoulder and a look of mirth and murder on his face.\nNo Tattered Prince, Selmy noted. No Brown Ben Plumm. Ser Barristan eyed Bloodbeard coolly. Give me half a reason to dance with you, and we will see who is laughing at the end.\nReznak mo Reznak wormed his way forward. \u201cWise Masters, you honor us. His Radiance King Hizdahr bids welcome to his friends from Yunkai. We understand\u2014\u201d\n\u201cUnderstand this.\u201d Bloodbeard pulled a severed head from his sack and flung it at the seneschal.\nReznak gave a squeak of fright and leapt aside. The head bounced past him, leaving spots of blood on the purple marble floor as it rolled until it fetched up against the foot of King Hizdahr\u2019s dragon throne. Up and down the length of the hall, Brazen Beasts lowered their spears. Goghor the Giant lumbered forward to place himself before the king\u2019s throne, and the Spotted Cat and Khrazz moved to either side of him to form a wall.\nBloodbeard laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. He won\u2019t bite.\u201d\nGingerly, so gingerly, the seneschal approached the head, lifted it delicately by the hair. \u201cAdmiral Groleo.\u201d\nSer Barristan glanced toward the throne. He had served so many kings, he could not help but imagine how they might have reacted to this provocation. Aerys would have flinched away in horror, likely cutting himself on the barbs of the Iron Throne, then shrieked at his swordsmen to cut the Yunkishmen to pieces. Robert would have shouted for his hammer to repay Bloodbeard in kind. Even Jaehaerys, reckoned weak by many, would have ordered the arrest of Bloodbeard and the Yunkish slavers.\nHizdahr sat frozen, a man transfixed. Reznak set the head on a satin pillow at the king\u2019s feet, then scampered away, his mouth twisted up in a moue of distaste. Ser Barristan could smell the seneschal\u2019s heavy floral perfume from several yards away.\nThe dead man stared up reproachfully. His beard was brown with caked blood, but a trickle of red still leaked from his neck. From the look of him, it had taken more than one blow to part his head from his body. In the back of the hall, petitioners began to slip away. One of the Brazen Beasts ripped off his brass hawk\u2019s mask and began to spew up his breakfast.\nBarristan Selmy was no stranger to severed heads. This one, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he had crossed half the world with the old seafarer, from Pentos to Qarth and back again to Astapor. Groleo was a good man. He did not deserve this end. All he ever wanted was to go home. The knight tensed, waiting.\n\u201cThis,\u201d King Hizdahr said at last, \u201cthis is not\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we are not pleased, this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what is the meaning of this\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe slaver in the maroon tokar produced a parchment. \u201cI have the honor to bear this message from the council of masters.\u201d He unrolled the scroll. \u201cIt is here written, \u2018Seven entered Meereen to sign the peace accords and witness the celebratory games at the Pit of Daznak. As surety for their safety, seven hostages were tendered us. The Yellow City mourns its noble son Yurkhaz zo Yunzak, who perished cruelly whilst a guest of Meereen. Blood must pay for blood.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nGroleo had a wife back in Pentos. Children, grandchildren. Why him, of all the hostages? Jhogo, Hero, and Daario Naharis all commanded fighting men, but Groleo had been an admiral without a fleet. Did they draw straws, or did they think Groleo the least valuable to us, the least likely to provoke reprisal? the knight asked himself\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but it was easier to pose that question than to answer it. I have no skill at unraveling such knots.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Ser Barristan called out. \u201cIf it please you to recall, the noble Yurkhaz died by happenstance. He stumbled on the steps as he tried to flee the dragon and was crushed beneath the feet of his own slaves and companions. That, or his heart burst in terror. He was old.\u201d\n\u201cWho is this who speaks without the king\u2019s leave?\u201d asked the Yunkish lord in the striped tokar, a small man with a receding chin and teeth too big for his mouth. He reminded Selmy of a rabbit. \u201cMust the lords of Yunkai attend to the natterings of guards?\u201d He shook the pearls that fringed his tokar.\nHizdahr zo Loraq could not seem to look away from the head. Only when Reznak whispered something in his ear did he finally bestir himself. \u201cYurkhaz zo Yunzak was your supreme commander,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich of you speaks for Yunkai now?\u201d\n\u201cAll of us,\u201d said the rabbit. \u201cThe council of masters.\u201d\nKing Hizdahr found some steel. \u201cThen all of you bear the responsibility for this breach of our peace.\u201d\nThe Yunkishman in the breastplate gave answer. \u201cOur peace has not been breached. Blood pays for blood, a life for a life. To show our good faith, we return three of your hostages.\u201d The iron ranks behind him parted. Three Meereenese were ushered forward, clutching at their tokars\u2014two women and a man.\n\u201cSister,\u201d said Hizdahr zo Loraq, stiffly. \u201cCousins.\u201d He gestured at the bleeding head. \u201cRemove that from our sight.\u201d\n\u201cThe admiral was a man of the sea,\u201d Ser Barristan reminded him. \u201cMayhaps Your Magnificence might ask the Yunkai\u2019i to return his body to us, so we may bury him beneath the waves?\u201d\nThe rabbit-toothed lord waved a hand. \u201cIf it please Your Radiance, this shall be done. A sign of our respect.\u201d\nReznak mo Reznak cleared his throat noisily. \u201cMeaning no offense, yet it seems to me that Her Worship Queen Daenerys gave you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0ah\u00a0\u2026\u00a0seven hostages. The other three\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe others shall remain our guests,\u201d announced the Yunkish lord in the breastplate, \u201cuntil the dragons have been destroyed.\u201d\nA hush fell across the hall. Then came the murmurs and the mutters, whispered curses, whispered prayers, the hornets stirring in their hive. \u201cThe dragons\u00a0\u2026\u201d said King Hizdahr.\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0are monsters, as all men saw in Daznak\u2019s Pit. No true peace is possible whilst they live.\u201d\nReznak replied. \u201cHer Magnificence Queen Daenerys is Mother of Dragons. Only she can\u2014\u201d\nBloodbeard\u2019s scorn cut him off. \u201cShe is gone. Burned and devoured. Weeds grow through her broken skull.\u201d\nA roar greeted those words. Some began to shout and curse. Others stamped their feet and whistled their approval. It took the Brazen Beasts pounding the butts of their spears against the floor before the hall quieted again.\nSer Barristan never once took his eyes off Bloodbeard. He came to sack a city, and Hizdahr\u2019s peace has cheated him of his plunder. He will do whatever he must to start the bloodshed.\nHizdahr zo Loraq rose slowly from his dragon throne. \u201cI must consult my council. This court is done.\u201d\n\u201cAll kneel for His Magnificence Hizdahr zo Loraq, Fourteenth of That Ancient Name, King of Meereen, Scion of Ghis, Octarch of the Old Empire, Master of the Skahazadhan, Consort to Dragons and Blood of the Harpy,\u201d the herald shouted. Brazen Beasts swung out amongst the pillars to form a line, then began a slow advance in lockstep, ushering the petitioners from the hall.\nThe Dornishmen did not have as far to go as most. As befit his rank and station, Quentyn Martell had been given quarters within the Great Pyramid, two levels down\u2014a handsome suite of rooms with its own privy and walled terrace. Perhaps that was why he and his companions lingered, waiting until the press had lessened before beginning to make their way toward the steps.\nSer Barristan watched them, thoughtful. What would Daenerys want? he asked himself. He thought he knew. The old knight strode across the hall, his long white cloak rippling behind him. He caught the Dornishmen at the top of the steps. \u201cYour father\u2019s court was never half so lively,\u201d he heard Drinkwater japing.\n\u201cPrince Quentyn,\u201d Selmy called. \u201cMight I beg a word?\u201d\nQuentyn Martell turned. \u201cSer Barristan. Of course. My chambers are one level down.\u201d\nNo. \u201cIt is not my place to counsel you, Prince Quentyn\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if I were you, I would not return to my chambers. You and your friends should go down the steps and leave.\u201d\nPrince Quentyn stared. \u201cLeave the pyramid?\u201d\n\u201cLeave the city. Return to Dorne.\u201d\nThe Dornishmen exchanged a look. \u201cOur arms and armor are back in our apartments,\u201d said Gerris Drinkwater. \u201cNot to mention most of the coin that we have left.\u201d\n\u201cSwords can be replaced,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cI can provide you with coin enough for passage back to Dorne. Prince Quentyn, the king made note of you today. He frowned.\u201d\nGerris Drinkwater laughed. \u201cShould we be frightened of Hizdahr zo Loraq? You saw him just now. He quailed before the Yunkishmen. They sent him a head, and he did nothing.\u201d\nQuentyn Martell nodded in agreement. \u201cA prince does well to think before he acts. This king\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I do not know what to think of him. The queen warned me against him as well, true, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe warned you?\u201d Selmy frowned. \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d\nPrince Quentyn flushed. \u201cThe marriage pact\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014was made by two dead men and contained not a word about the queen or you. It promised your sister\u2019s hand to the queen\u2019s brother, another dead man. It has no force. Until you turned up here, Her Grace was ignorant of its existence. Your father keeps his secrets well, Prince Quentyn. Too well, I fear. If the queen had known of this pact in Qarth, she might never have turned aside for Slaver\u2019s Bay, but you came too late. I have no wish to salt your wounds, but Her Grace has a new husband and an old paramour, and seems to prefer the both of them to you.\u201d\nAnger flashed in the prince\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cThis Ghiscari lordling is no fit consort for the queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not for you to judge.\u201d Ser Barristan paused, wondering if he had said too much already. No. Tell him the rest of it. \u201cThat day at Daznak\u2019s Pit, some of the food in the royal box was poisoned. It was only chance that Strong Belwas ate it all. The Blue Graces say that only his size and freakish strength have saved him, but it was a near thing. He may yet die.\u201d\nThe shock was plain on Prince Quentyn\u2019s face. \u201cPoison\u00a0\u2026\u00a0meant for Daenerys?\u201d\n\u201cHer or Hizdahr. Perhaps both. The box was his, though. His Grace made all the arrangements. If the poison was his doing\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, he will need a scapegoat. Who better than a rival from a distant land who has no friends at this court? Who better than a suitor the queen spurned?\u201d\nQuentyn Martell went pale. \u201cMe? I would never\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you cannot think I had any part in any\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThat was the truth, or he is a master mummer. \u201cOthers might,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cThe Red Viper was your uncle. And you have good reason to want King Hizdahr dead.\u201d\n\u201cSo do others,\u201d suggested Gerris Drinkwater. \u201cNaharis, for one. The queen\u2019s\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0paramour,\u201d Ser Barristan finished, before the Dornish knight could say anything that might besmirch the queen\u2019s honor. \u201cThat is what you call them down in Dorne, is it not?\u201d He did not wait for a reply. \u201cPrince Lewyn was my Sworn Brother. In those days there were few secrets amongst the Kingsguard. I know he kept a paramour. He did not feel there was any shame in that.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Quentyn, red-faced, \u201cbut\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDaario would kill Hizdahr in a heartbeat if he dared,\u201d Ser Barristan went on. \u201cBut not with poison. Never. And Daario was not there in any case. Hizdahr would be pleased to blame him for the locusts, all the same\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the king may yet have need of the Stormcrows, and he will lose them if he appears complicit in the death of their captain. No, my prince. If His Grace needs a poisoner, he will look to you.\u201d He had said all that he could safely say. In a few more days, if the gods smiled on them, Hizdahr zo Loraq would no longer rule Meereen\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no good would be served by having Prince Quentyn caught up in the bloodbath that was coming. \u201cIf you must remain in Meereen, you would do well to stay away from court and hope Hizdahr forgets you,\u201d Ser Barristan finished, \u201cbut a ship for Volantis would be wiser, my prince. Whatever course you choose, I wish you well.\u201d\nBefore he had gone three steps, Quentyn Martell called out to him. \u201cBarristan the Bold, they call you.\u201d\n\u201cSome do.\u201d Selmy had won that name when he was ten years old, a new-made squire, yet so vain and proud and foolish that he got it in his head that he could joust with tried and proven knights. So he\u2019d borrowed a warhorse and some plate from Lord Dondarrion\u2019s armory and entered the lists at Blackhaven as a mystery knight. Even the herald laughed. My arms were so thin that when I lowered my lance it was all I could do to keep the point from furrowing the ground. Lord Dondarrion would have been within his rights to pull him off the horse and spank him, but the Prince of Dragonflies had taken pity on the addlepated boy in the ill-fitting armor and accorded him the respect of taking up his challenge. One course was all that it required. Afterward Prince Duncan helped him to his feet and removed his helm. \u201cA boy,\u201d he had proclaimed to the crowd. \u201cA bold boy.\u201d Fifty-three years ago. How many men are still alive who were there at Blackhaven?\n\u201cWhat name do you think they will give me, should I return to Dorne without Daenerys?\u201d Prince Quentyn asked. \u201cQuentyn the Cautious? Quentyn the Craven? Quentyn the Quail?\u201d\nThe Prince Who Came Too Late, the old knight thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if a knight of the Kingsguard learns nothing else, he learns to guard his tongue. \u201cQuentyn the Wise,\u201d he suggested. And hoped that it was true.",

      "content": "THE SPURNED SUITOR\nThe hour of ghosts was almost upon them when Ser Gerris Drinkwater returned to the pyramid to report that he had found Beans, Books, and Old Bill Bone in one of Meereen\u2019s less savory cellars, drinking yellow wine and watching naked slaves kill one another with bare hands and filed teeth.\n\u201cBeans pulled a blade and proposed a wager to determine if deserters had bellies full of yellow slime,\u201d Ser Gerris reported, \u201cso I tossed him a dragon and asked if yellow gold would do. He bit the coin and asked what I meant to buy. When I told him he slipped the knife away and asked if I was drunk or mad.\u201d\n\u201cLet him think what he wants, so long as he delivers the message,\u201d said Quentyn.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do that much. I\u2019ll wager you get your meeting too, if only so Rags can have Pretty Meris cut your liver out and fry it up with onions. We should be heeding Selmy. When Barristan the Bold tells you to run, a wise man laces up his boots. We should find a ship for Volantis whilst the port is still open.\u201d\nJust the mention turned Ser Archibald\u2019s cheeks green. \u201cNo more ships. I\u2019d sooner hop back to Volantis on one foot.\u201d\nVolantis, Quentyn thought. Then Lys, then home. Back the way I came, empty-handed. Three brave men dead, for what?\nIt would be sweet to see the Greenblood again, to visit Sunspear and the Water Gardens and breathe the clean sweet mountain air of Yronwood in place of the hot, wet, filthy humors of Slaver\u2019s Bay. His father would speak no word of rebuke, Quentyn knew, but the disappointment would be there in his eyes. His sister would be scornful, the Sand Snakes would mock him with smiles sharp as swords, and Lord Yronwood, his second father, who had sent his own son along to keep him safe\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cI will not keep you here,\u201d Quentyn told his friends. \u201cMy father laid this task on me, not you. Go home, if that is what you want. By whatever means you like. I am staying.\u201d\nThe big man shrugged. \u201cThen Drink and me are staying too.\u201d\nThe next night, Denzo D\u2019han turned up at Prince Quentyn\u2019s door to talk terms. \u201cHe will meet with you on the morrow, by the spice market. Look for a door marked with a purple lotus. Knock twice and call for freedom.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Quentyn. \u201cArch and Gerris will be with me. He can bring two men as well. No more.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please my prince.\u201d The words were polite enough, but Denzo\u2019s tone was edged with malice, and the eyes of the warrior poet gleamed bright with mockery. \u201cCome at sunset. And see that you are not followed.\u201d\nThe Dornishmen left the Great Pyramid an hour shy of sunset in case they took a wrong turn or had difficulty finding the purple lotus. Quentyn and Gerris wore their sword belts. The big man had his warhammer slung across his broad back.\n\u201cIt is still not too late to abandon this folly,\u201d Gerris said, as they made their way down a foetid alley toward the old spice market. The smell of piss was in the air, and they could hear the rumble of a corpse cart\u2019s iron-rimmed wheels off ahead. \u201cOld Bill Bone used to say that Pretty Maris could stretch out a man\u2019s dying for a moon\u2019s turn. We lied to them, Quent. Used them to get us here, then went over to the Stormcrows.\u201d\n\u201cAs we were commanded.\u201d\n\u201cTatters never meant for us to do it for real, though,\u201d put in the big man. \u201cHis other boys, Ser Orson and Dick Straw, Hungerford, Will of the Woods, that lot, they\u2019re still down in some dungeon thanks to us. Old Rags can\u2019t have liked that much.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Prince Quentyn said, \u201cbut he likes gold.\u201d\nGerris laughed. \u201cA pity we have none. Do you trust this peace, Quent? I don\u2019t. Half the city is calling the dragonslayer a hero, and the other half spits blood at the mention of his name.\u201d\n\u201cHarzoo,\u201d the big man said.\nQuentyn frowned. \u201cHis name was Harghaz.\u201d\n\u201cHizdahr, Humzum, Hagnag, what does it matter? I call them all Harzoo. He was no dragonslayer. All he did was get his arse roasted black and crispy.\u201d\n\u201cHe was brave.\u201d Would I have the courage to face that monster with nothing but a spear?\n\u201cHe died bravely, is what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cHe died screaming,\u201d said Arch.\nGerris put a hand on Quentyn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEven if the queen returns, she\u2019ll still be married.\u201d\n\u201cNot if I give King Harzoo a little smack with my hammer,\u201d suggested the big man.\n\u201cHizdahr,\u201d said Quentyn. \u201cHis name is Hizdahr.\u201d\n\u201cOne kiss from my hammer and no one will care what his name was,\u201d said Arch.\nThey do not see. His friends had lost sight of his true purpose here. The road leads through her, not to her. Daenerys is the means to the prize, not the prize itself. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The dragon has three heads,\u2019 she said to me. \u2018My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes,\u2019 she said. \u2018I know why you are here. For fire and blood.\u2019 I have Targaryen blood in me, you know that. I can trace my lineage back\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck your lineage,\u201d said Gerris. \u201cThe dragons won\u2019t care about your blood, except maybe how it tastes. You cannot tame a dragon with a history lesson. They\u2019re monsters, not maesters. Quent, is this truly what you want to do?\u201d\n\u201cThis is what I have to do. For Dorne. For my father. For Cletus and Will and Maester Kedry.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Gerris. \u201cThey won\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cAll dead,\u201d Quentyn agreed. \u201cFor what? To bring me here, so I might wed the dragon queen. A grand adventure, Cletus called it. Demon roads and stormy seas, and at the end of it the most beautiful woman in the world. A tale to tell our grandchildren. But Cletus will never father a child, unless he left a bastard in the belly of that tavern wench he liked. Will will never have his wedding. Their deaths should have some meaning.\u201d\nGerris pointed to where a corpse slumped against a brick wall, attended by a cloud of glistening green flies. \u201cDid his death have meaning?\u201d\nQuentyn looked at the body with distaste. \u201cHe died of the flux. Stay well away from him.\u201d The pale mare was inside the city walls. Small wonder that the streets seemed so empty. \u201cThe Unsullied will send a corpse cart for him.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt. But that was not my question. Men\u2019s lives have meaning, not their deaths. I loved Will and Cletus too, but this will not bring them back to us. This is a mistake, Quent. You cannot trust in sellswords.\u201d\n\u201cThey are men like any other men. They want gold, glory, power. That\u2019s all I am trusting in.\u201d That, and my own destiny. I am a prince of Dorne, and the blood of dragons is in my veins.\nThe sun had sunk below the city wall by the time they found the purple lotus, painted on the weathered wooden door of a low brick hovel squatting amidst a row of similar hovels in the shadow of the great yellow-and-green pyramid of Rhazdar. Quentyn knocked twice, as instructed. A gruff voice answered through the door, growling something unintelligible in the mongrel tongue of Slaver\u2019s Bay, an ugly blend of Old Ghiscari and High Valyrian. The prince answered in the same tongue. \u201cFreedom.\u201d\nThe door opened. Gerris entered first, for caution\u2019s sake, with Quentyn close behind him and the big man bringing up the rear. Within, the air was hazy with bluish smoke, whose sweet smell could not quite cover up the deeper stinks of piss and sour wine and rotting meat. The space was much larger than it had seemed from without, stretching off to right and left into the adjoining hovels. What had appeared to be a dozen structures from the street turned into one long hall inside.\nAt this hour the house was less than half full. A few of the patrons favored the Dornishmen with looks bored or hostile or curious. The rest were crowded around the pit at the far end of the room, where a pair of naked men were slashing at each other with knives whilst the watchers cheered them on.\nQuentyn saw no sign of the men they had come to meet. Then a door he had not seen before swung open, and an old woman emerged, a shriveled thing in a dark red tokar fringed with tiny golden skulls. Her skin was white as mare\u2019s milk, her hair so thin that he could see the scalp beneath. \u201cDorne,\u201d she said, \u201cI be Zahrina. Purple Lotus. Go down here, you find them.\u201d She held the door and gestured them through.\nBeyond was a flight of wooden steps, steep and twisting. This time the big man led the way and Gerris was the rear guard, with the prince between them. An undercellar. It was a long way down, and so dark that Quentyn had to feel his way to keep from slipping. Near the bottom Ser Archibald pulled his dagger.\nThey emerged in a brick vault thrice the size of the winesink above. Huge wooden vats lined the walls as far as the prince could see. A red lantern hung on a hook just inside the door, and a greasy black candle flickered on an overturned barrel serving as a table. That was the only light.\nCaggo Corpsekiller was pacing by the wine vats, his black arakh hanging at his hip. Pretty Meris stood cradling a crossbow, her eyes as cold and dead as two grey stones. Denzo D\u2019han barred the door once the Dornishmen were inside, then took up a position in front of it, arms crossed against his chest.\nOne too many, Quentyn thought.\nThe Tattered Prince himself was seated at the table, nursing a cup of wine. In the yellow candlelight his silver-grey hair seemed almost golden, though the pouches underneath his eyes were etched as large as saddlebags. He wore a brown wool traveler\u2019s cloak, with silvery chain mail glimmering underneath. Did that betoken treachery or simple prudence? An old sellsword is a cautious sellsword. Quentyn approached his table. \u201cMy lord. You look different without your cloak.\u201d\n\u201cMy ragged raiment?\u201d The Pentoshi gave a shrug. \u201cA poor thing\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet those tatters fill my foes with fear, and on the battlefield the sight of my rags blowing in the wind emboldens my men more than any banner. And if I want to move unseen, I need only slip it off to become plain and unremarkable.\u201d He gestured at the bench across from him. \u201cSit. I understand you are a prince. Would that I had known. Will you drink? Zahrina offers food as well. Her bread is stale and her stew is unspeakable. Grease and salt, with a morsel or two of meat. Dog, she says, but I think rat is more likely. It will not kill you, though. I have found that it is only when the food is tempting that one must beware. Poisoners invariably choose the choicest dishes.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought three men,\u201d Ser Gerris pointed out, with an edge in his voice. \u201cWe agreed on two apiece.\u201d\n\u201cMeris is no man. Meris, sweet, undo your shirt, show him.\u201d\n\u201cThat will not be necessary,\u201d said Quentyn. If the talk he had heard was true, beneath that shirt Pretty Meris had only the scars left by the men who\u2019d cut her breasts off. \u201cMeris is a woman, I agree. You\u2019ve still twisted the terms.\u201d\n\u201cTattered and twisty, what a rogue I am. Three to two is not much of an advantage, it must be admitted, but it counts for something. In this world, a man must learn to seize whatever gifts the gods chose to send him. That was a lesson I learned at some cost. I offer it to you as a sign of my good faith.\u201d He gestured at the chair again. \u201cSit, and say what you came to say. I promise not to have you killed until I have heard you out. That is the least I can do for a fellow prince. Quentyn, is it?\u201d\n\u201cQuentyn of House Martell.\u201d\n\u201cFrog suits you better. It is not my custom to drink with liars and deserters, but you\u2019ve made me curious.\u201d\nQuentyn sat. One wrong word, and this could turn to blood in half a heartbeat. \u201cI ask your pardon for our deception. The only ships sailing for Slaver\u2019s Bay were those that had been hired to bring you to the wars.\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince gave a shrug. \u201cEvery turncloak has his tale. You are not the first to swear me your swords, take my coin, and run. All of them have reasons. \u2018My little son is sick,\u2019 or \u2018My wife is putting horns on me,\u2019 or \u2018The other men all make me suck their cocks.\u2019 Such a charming boy, the last, but I did not excuse his desertion. Another fellow told me our food was so wretched that he had to flee before it made him sick, so I had his foot cut off, roasted it up, and fed it to him. Then I made him our camp cook. Our meals improved markedly, and when his contract was fulfilled he signed another. You, though\u00a0\u2026\u00a0several of my best are locked up in the queen\u2019s dungeons thanks to that lying tongue of yours, and I doubt that you can even cook.\u201d\n\u201cI am a prince of Dorne,\u201d said Quentyn. \u201cI had a duty to my father and my people. There was a secret marriage pact.\u201d\n\u201cSo I heard. And when the silver queen saw your scrap of parchment she fell into your arms, yes?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Pretty Meris.\n\u201cNo? Oh, I recall. Your bride flew off on a dragon. Well, when she returns, do be sure to invite us to your nuptials. The men of the company would love to drink to your happiness, and I do love a Westerosi wedding. The bedding part especially, only\u00a0\u2026\u00a0oh, wait\u00a0\u2026\u201d He turned to Denzo D\u2019han. \u201cDenzo, I thought you told me that the dragon queen had married some Ghiscari.\u201d\n\u201cA Meereenese nobleman. Rich.\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince turned back to Quentyn. \u201cCould that be true? Surely not. What of your marriage pact?\u201d\n\u201cShe laughed at him,\u201d said Pretty Meris.\nDaenerys never laughed. The rest of Meereen might see him as an amusing curiosity, like the exiled Summer Islander King Robert used to keep at King\u2019s Landing, but the queen had always spoken to him gently. \u201cWe came too late,\u201d said Quentyn.\n\u201cA pity you did not desert me sooner.\u201d The Tattered Prince sipped at his wine. \u201cSo\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no wedding for Prince Frog. Is that why you\u2019ve come hopping back to me? Have my three brave Dornish lads decided to honor their contracts?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHow vexing.\u201d\n\u201cYurkhaz zo Yunzak is dead.\u201d\n\u201cAncient tidings. I saw him die. The poor man saw a dragon and stumbled as he tried to flee. Then a thousand of his closest friends stepped on him. No doubt the Yellow City is awash in tears. Did you ask me here to toast his memory?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Have the Yunkishmen chosen a new commander?\u201d\n\u201cThe council of masters has been unable to agree. Yezzan zo Qaggaz had the most support, but now he\u2019s died as well. The Wise Masters are rotating the supreme command amongst themselves. Today our leader is the one your friends in the ranks dubbed the Drunken Conqueror. On the morrow, it will be Lord Wobblecheeks.\u201d\n\u201cThe Rabbit,\u201d said Meris. \u201cWobblecheeks was yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI stand corrected, my sweetling. Our Yunkish friends were kind enough to provide us with a chart. I must strive to be more assiduous about consulting it.\u201d\n\u201cYurkhaz zo Yunzak was the man who hired you.\u201d\n\u201cHe signed our contract on behalf of his city. Just so.\u201d\n\u201cMeereen and Yunkai have made peace. The siege is to be lifted, the armies disbanded. There will be no battle, no slaughter, no city to sack and plunder.\u201d\n\u201cLife is full of disappointments.\u201d\n\u201cHow long do you think the Yunkishmen will want to continue paying wages to four free companies?\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince took a sip of wine and said, \u201cA vexing question. But this is the way of life for we men of the free companies. One war ends, another begins. Fortunately there is always someone fighting someone somewhere. Perhaps here. Even as we sit here drinking Bloodbeard is urging our Yunkish friends to present King Hizdahr with another head. Freedmen and slavers eye each other\u2019s necks and sharpen their knives, the Sons of the Harpy plot in their pyramids, the pale mare rides down slave and lord alike, our friends from the Yellow City gaze out to sea, and somewhere in the grasslands a dragon nibbles the tender flesh of Daenerys Targaryen. Who rules Meereen tonight? Who will rule it on the morrow?\u201d The Pentoshi gave a shrug. \u201cOne thing I am certain of. Someone will have need of our swords.\u201d\n\u201cI have need of those swords. Dorne will hire you.\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince glanced at Pretty Meris. \u201cHe does not lack for gall, this Frog. Must I remind him? My dear prince, the last contract we signed you used to wipe your pretty pink bottom.\u201d\n\u201cI will double whatever the Yunkishmen are paying you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd pay in gold upon the signing of our contract, yes?\u201d\n\u201cI will pay you part when we reach Volantis, the rest when I am back in Sunspear. We brought gold with us when we set sail, but it would have been hard to conceal once we joined the company, so we gave it over to the banks. I can show you papers.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Papers. But we will be paid double.\u201d\n\u201cTwice as many papers,\u201d said Pretty Meris.\n\u201cThe rest you\u2019ll have in Dorne,\u201d Quentyn insisted. \u201cMy father is a man of honor. If I put my seal to an agreement, he will fulfill its terms. You have my word on that.\u201d\nThe Tattered Prince finished his wine, turned the cup over, and set it down between them. \u201cSo. Let me see if I understand. A proven liar and oathbreaker wishes to contract with us and pay in promises. And for what services? I wonder. Are my Windblown to smash the Yunkai\u2019i and sack the Yellow City? Defeat a Dothraki khalasar in the field? Escort you home to your father? Or will you be content if we deliver Queen Daenerys to your bed wet and willing? Tell me true, Prince Frog. What would you have of me and mine?\u201d\n\u201cI need you to help me steal a dragon.\u201d\nCaggo Corpsekiller chuckled. Pretty Meris curled her lip in a half-smile. Denzo D\u2019han whistled.\nThe Tattered Prince only leaned back on his stool and said, \u201cDouble does not pay for dragons, princeling. Even a frog should know that much. Dragons come dear. And men who pay in promises should have at least the sense to promise more.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want me to triple\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat I want,\u201d said the Tattered Prince, \u201cis Pentos.\u201d",

      "content": "THE GRIFFIN REBORN\nHe sent the archers in first.\nBlack Balaq commanded one thousand bows. In his youth, Jon Connington had shared the disdain most knights had for bowmen, but he had grown wiser in exile. In its own way, the arrow was as deadly as the sword, so for the long voyage he had insisted that Homeless Harry Strickland break Balaq\u2019s command into ten companies of one hundred men and place each company upon a different ship.\nSix of those ships had stayed together well enough to deliver their passengers to the shores of Cape Wrath (the other four were lagging but would turn up eventually, the Volantenes assured them, but Griff thought it just as likely they were lost or had landed elsewhere), which left the company with six hundred bows. For this, two hundred proved sufficient. \u201cThey will try to send out ravens,\u201d he told Black Balaq. \u201cWatch the maester\u2019s tower. Here.\u201d He pointed to the map he had drawn in the mud of their campsite. \u201cBring down every bird that leaves the castle.\u201d\n\u201cThis we do,\u201d replied the Summer Islander.\nA third of Balaq\u2019s men used crossbows, another third the double-curved horn-and-sinew bows of the east. Better than these were the big yew longbows borne by the archers of Westerosi blood, and best of all were the great bows of goldenheart treasured by Black Balaq himself and his fifty Summer Islanders. Only a dragonbone bow could outrange one made of goldenheart. Whatever bow they carried, all of Balaq\u2019s men were sharp-eyed, seasoned veterans who had proved their worth in a hundred battles, raids, and skirmishes. They proved it again at Griffin\u2019s Roost.\nThe castle rose from the shores of Cape Wrath, on a lofty crag of dark red stone surrounded on three sides by the surging waters of Shipbreaker Bay. Its only approach was defended by a gatehouse, behind which lay the long bare ridge the Conningtons called the griffin\u2019s throat. To force the throat could be a bloody business, since the ridge exposed the attackers to the spears, stones, and arrows of defenders in the two round towers that flanked the castle\u2019s main gates. And once they reached those gates, the men inside could pour down boiling oil on their heads. Griff expected to lose a hundred men, perhaps more.\nThey lost four.\nThe woods had been allowed to encroach on the field beyond the gatehouse, so Franklyn Flowers was able to use the brush for concealment and lead his men within twenty yards of the gates before emerging from the trees with the ram they\u2019d fashioned back at camp. The crash of wood on wood brought two men to the battlements; Black Balaq\u2019s archers took down both of them before they could rub the sleep out of their eyes. The gate turned out to be closed but not barred; it gave way at the second blow, and Ser Franklyn\u2019s men were halfway up the throat before a warhorn sounded the alarum from the castle proper.\nThe first raven took flight as their grapnels were arcing above the curtain wall, the second a few moments later. Neither bird had flown a hundred yards before an arrow took it down. A guard inside dumped down a bucket of oil on the first men to reach the gates, but as he\u2019d had no time to heat it, the bucket caused more damage than its contents. Swords were soon ringing in half a dozen places along the battlements. The men of the Golden Company clambered through the merlons and raced along the wallwalks, shouting \u201cA griffin! A griffin!,\u201d the ancient battle cry of House Connington, which must have left the defenders even more confused.\nIt was over within minutes. Griff rode up the throat on a white courser beside Homeless Harry Strickland. As they neared the castle, he saw a third raven flap from the maester\u2019s tower, only to be feathered by Black Balaq himself. \u201cNo more messages,\u201d he told Ser Franklyn Flowers in the yard. The next thing to come flying from the maester\u2019s tower was the maester. The way his arms were flapping, he might have been mistaken for another bird.\nThat was the end of all resistance. What guards remained had thrown down their weapons. And quick as that, Griffin\u2019s Roost was his again, and Jon Connington was once more a lord.\n\u201cSer Franklyn,\u201d he said, \u201cgo through the keep and kitchens and roust out everyone you find. Malo, do the same with the maester\u2019s tower and the armory. Ser Brendel, the stables, sept, and barracks. Bring them out into the yard, and try not to kill anyone who does not insist on dying. We want to win the stormlands, and we won\u2019t do that with slaughter. Be sure you look under the altar of the Mother, there\u2019s a hidden stair there that leads down to a secret bolt-hole. And another under the northwest tower that goes straight down to the sea. No one is to escape.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t, m\u2019lord,\u201d promised Franklyn Flowers.\nConnington watched them dash off, then beckoned to the Halfmaester. \u201cHaldon, take charge of the rookery. I\u2019ll have messages to send out tonight.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope they left some ravens for us.\u201d\nEven Homeless Harry was impressed by the swiftness of their victory. \u201cI never thought that it would be so easy,\u201d the captain-general said, as they walked into the great hall to have a look at the carved and gilded Griffin Seat where fifty generations of Conningtons had sat and ruled.\n\u201cIt will get harder. So far we have taken them unawares. That cannot last forever, even if Black Balaq brings down every raven in the realm.\u201d\nStrickland studied the faded tapestries on the walls, the arched windows with their myriad diamond-shaped panes of red and white glass, the racks of spears and swords and warhammers. \u201cLet them come. This place can stand against twenty times our number, so long as we are well provisioned. And you say there is a way in and out by sea?\u201d\n\u201cBelow. A hidden cove beneath the crag, which appears only when the tide is out.\u201d But Connington had no intention of \u201cletting them come.\u201d Griffin\u2019s Roost was strong but small, and so long as they sat here they would seem small as well. But there was another castle nearby, vastly larger and impregnable. Take that, and the realm will shake. \u201cYou must excuse me, Captain-General. My lord father is buried beneath the sept, and it has been too many years since last I prayed for him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d\nYet when they parted, Jon Connington did not go to the sept. Instead his steps led him up to the roof of the east tower, the tallest at Griffin\u2019s Roost. As he climbed he remembered past ascents\u2014a hundred with his lord father, who liked to stand and look out over woods and crags and sea and know that all he saw belonged to House Connington, and one (only one!) with Rhaegar Targaryen. Prince Rhaegar was returning from Dorne, and he and his escort had lingered here a fortnight. He was so young then, and I was younger. Boys, the both of us. At the welcoming feast, the prince had taken up his silver-stringed harp and played for them. A song of love and doom, Jon Connington recalled, and every woman in the hall was weeping when he put down the harp. Not the men, of course. Particularly not his own father, whose only love was land. Lord Armond Connington spent the entire evening trying to win the prince to his side in his dispute with Lord Morrigen.\nThe door to the roof of the tower was stuck so fast that it was plain no one had opened it in years. He had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. But when Jon Connington stepped out onto the high battlements, the view was just as intoxicating as he remembered: the crag with its wind-carved rocks and jagged spires, the sea below growling and worrying at the foot of the castle like some restless beast, endless leagues of sky and cloud, the wood with its autumnal colors. \u201cYour father\u2019s lands are beautiful,\u201d Prince Rhaegar had said, standing right where Jon was standing now. And the boy he\u2019d been had replied, \u201cOne day they will all be mine.\u201d As if that could impress a prince who was heir to the entire realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.\nGriffin\u2019s Roost had been his, eventually, if only for a few short years. From here, Jon Connington had ruled broad lands extending many leagues to the west, north, and south, just as his father and his father\u2019s father had before him. But his father and his father\u2019s father had never lost their lands. He had. I rose too high, loved too hard, dared too much. I tried to grasp a star, overreached, and fell.\nAfter the Battle of the Bells, when Aerys Targaryen had stripped him of his titles and sent him into exile in a mad fit of ingratitude and suspicion, the lands and lordship had remained within House Connington, passing to his cousin Ser Ronald, the man whom Jon had made his castellan when he went to King\u2019s Landing to attend Prince Rhaegar. Robert Baratheon had completed the destruction of the griffins after the war. Cousin Ronald was permitted to retain his castle and his head, but he lost his lordship, thereafter being merely the Knight of Griffin\u2019s Roost, and nine-tenths of his lands were taken from him and parceled out to neighbor lords who had supported Robert\u2019s claim.\nRonald Connington had died years before. The present Knight of Griffin\u2019s Roost, his son Ronnet, was said to be off at war in the riverlands. That was for the best. In Jon Connington\u2019s experience, men would fight for things they felt were theirs, even things they\u2019d gained by theft. He did not relish the notion of celebrating his return by killing one of his own kin. Red Ronnet\u2019s sire had been quick to take advantage of his lord cousin\u2019s downfall, true, but his son had been a child at the time. Jon Connington did not even hate the late Ser Ronald as much as he might have. The fault was his.\nHe had lost it all at Stoney Sept, in his arrogance.\nRobert Baratheon had been hiding somewhere in the town, wounded and alone. Jon Connington had known that, and he had also known that Robert\u2019s head upon a spear would have put an end to the rebellion, then and there. He was young and full of pride. How not? King Aerys had named him Hand and given him an army, and he meant to prove himself worthy of that trust, of Rhaegar\u2019s love. He would slay the rebel lord himself and carve a place out for himself in all the histories of the Seven Kingdoms.\nAnd so he swept down on Stoney Sept, closed off the town, and began a search. His knights went house to house, smashed in every door, peered into every cellar. He had even sent men crawling through the sewers, yet somehow Robert still eluded him. The townsfolk were hiding him. They moved him from one secret bolt-hole to the next, always one step ahead of the king\u2019s men. The whole town was a nest of traitors. At the end they had the usurper hidden in a brothel. What sort of king was that, who would hide behind the skirts of women? Yet whilst the search dragged on, Eddard Stark and Hoster Tully came down upon the town with a rebel army. Bells and battle followed, and Robert emerged from his brothel with a blade in hand, and almost slew Jon on the steps of the old sept that gave the town its name.\nFor years afterward, Jon Connington told himself that he was not to blame, that he had done all that any man could do. His soldiers searched every hole and hovel, he offered pardons and rewards, he took hostages and hung them in crow cages and swore that they would have neither food nor drink until Robert was delivered to him. All to no avail. \u201cTywin Lannister himself could have done no more,\u201d he had insisted one night to Blackheart, during his first year of exile.\n\u201cThere is where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Myles Toyne had replied. \u201cLord Tywin would not have bothered with a search. He would have burned that town and every living creature in it. Men and boys, babes at the breast, noble knights and holy septons, pigs and whores, rats and rebels, he would have burned them all. When the fires guttered out and only ash and cinders remained, he would have sent his men in to find the bones of Robert Baratheon. Later, when Stark and Tully turned up with their host, he would have offered pardons to the both of them, and they would have accepted and turned for home with their tails between their legs.\u201d\nHe was not wrong, Jon Connington reflected, leaning on the battlements of his forebears. I wanted the glory of slaying Robert in single combat, and I did not want the name of butcher. So Robert escaped me and cut down Rhaegar on the Trident. \u201cI failed the father,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I will not fail the son.\u201d\nBy the time Connington made his descent, his men had gathered the castle garrison and surviving smallfolk together in the yard. Though Ser Ronnet was indeed off north somewhere with Jaime Lannister, Griffin\u2019s Roost was not quite bereft of griffins. Amongst the prisoners were Ronnet\u2019s younger brother Raymund, his sister Alynne, and his natural son, a fierce red-haired boy they called Ronald Storm. All would make for useful hostages if and when Red Ronnet should return to try and take back the castle that his father had stolen. Connington ordered them confined to the west tower, under guard. The girl began to cry at that, and the bastard boy tried to bite the spearman closest to him. \u201cStop it, the both of you,\u201d he snapped at them. \u201cNo harm will come to any of you unless Red Ronnet proves an utter fool.\u201d\nOnly a few of the captives had been in service here when Jon Connington had last been lord: a grizzled serjeant, blind in one eye; a couple of the washerwomen; a groom who had been a stableboy during Robert\u2019s Rebellion; the cook, who had grown enormously fat; the castle armorer. Griff had let his beard grow out during the voyage, for the first time in many years, and to his surprise it had come in mostly red, though here and there ash showed amidst the fire. Clad in a long red-and-white tunic embroidered with the twin griffins of his House, counterchanged and combatant, he looked an older, sterner version of the young lord who had been Prince Rhaegar\u2019s friend and companion\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the men and women of Griffin\u2019s Roost still looked at him with strangers\u2019 eyes.\n\u201cSome of you will know me,\u201d he told them. \u201cThe rest will learn. I am your rightful lord, returned from exile. My enemies have told you I am dead. Those tales are false, as you can see. Serve me as faithfully as you have served my cousin, and no harm need come to any of you.\u201d\nHe brought them forward one by one, asked each man his name, then bid them kneel and swear him their allegiance. It all went swiftly. The soldiers of the garrison\u2014only four had survived the attack, the old serjeant and three boys\u2014laid their swords at his feet. No one balked. No one died.\nThat night in the great hall the victors feasted on roast meats and fresh-caught fish, washed down with rich red wines from the castle cellars. Jon Connington presided from the Griffin\u2019s Seat, sharing the high table with Homeless Harry Strickland, Black Balaq, Franklyn Flowers, and the three young griffins they had taken captive. The children were of his blood and he felt that he should know them, but when the bastard boy announced, \u201cMy father\u2019s going to kill you,\u201d he decided that his knowledge was sufficient, ordered them back to their cells, and excused himself.\nHaldon Halfmaester had been absent from the feast. Lord Jon found him in the maester\u2019s tower, bent over a pile of parchments, with maps spread out all around him. \u201cHoping to determine where the rest of the company might be?\u201d Connington asked him.\n\u201cWould that I could, my lord.\u201d\nTen thousand men had sailed from Volon Therys, with all their weapons, horses, elephants. Not quite half that number had turned up thus far on Westeros, at or near their intended landing site, a deserted stretch of coast on the edge of the rainwood\u00a0\u2026\u00a0lands that Jon Connington knew well, as they had once been his.\nOnly a few years ago, he would never have dared attempt a landing on Cape Wrath; the storm lords were too fiercely loyal to House Baratheon and to King Robert. But with both Robert and his brother Renly slain, everything was changed. Stannis was too harsh and cold a man to inspire much in the way of loyalty, even if he had not been half a world away, and the stormlands had little reason to love House Lannister. And Jon Connington was not without his own friends here. Some of the older lords will still remember me, and their sons will have heard the stories. And every man of them will know of Rhaegar, and his young son whose head was smashed against a cold stone wall.\nFortunately his own ship had been one of the first to reach their destination. Then it had only been a matter of establishing a campsite, assembling his men as they came ashore and moving quickly, before the local lordlings had any inkling of their peril. And there the Golden Company had proved its mettle. The chaos that would inevitably have delayed such a march with a hastily assembled host of household knights and local levies had been nowhere in evidence. These were the heirs of Bittersteel, and discipline was mother\u2019s milk to them.\n\u201cBy this time on the morrow we ought to hold three castles,\u201d he said. The force that had taken Griffin\u2019s Roost represented a quarter of their available strength; Ser Tristan Rivers had set off simultaneously for the seat of House Morrigen at Crow\u2019s Nest, and Laswell Peake for Rain House, the stronghold of the Wyldes, each with a force of comparable size. The rest of their men had remained in camp to guard their landing site and prince, under the command of the company\u2019s Volantene paymaster, Gorys Edoryen. Their numbers would continue to swell, one hoped; more ships were straggling in every day. \u201cWe still have too few horses.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no elephants,\u201d the Halfmaester reminded him. Not one of the great cogs carrying the elephants had turned up yet. They had last seen them at Lys, before the storm that had scattered half the fleet. \u201cHorses can be found in Westeros. Elephants\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014do not matter.\u201d The great beasts would be useful in a pitched battle, no doubt, but it would be some time before they had the strength to face their foes in the field. \u201cHave those parchments told you anything of use?\u201d\n\u201cOh, much and more, my lord.\u201d Haldon gave him a thin smile. \u201cThe Lannisters make enemies easily but seem to have a harder time keeping friends. Their alliance with the Tyrells is fraying, to judge from what I read here. Queen Cersei and Queen Margaery are fighting over the little king like two bitches with a chicken bone, and both have been accused of treason and debauchery. Mace Tyrell has abandoned his siege of Storm\u2019s End to march back to King\u2019s Landing and save his daughter, leaving only a token force behind to keep Stannis\u2019s men penned up inside the castle.\u201d\nConnington sat. \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\u201cIn the north the Lannisters are relying on the Boltons and in the riverlands upon the Freys, both houses long renowned for treachery and cruelty. Lord Stannis Baratheon remains in open rebellion and the ironborn of the islands have raised up a king as well. No one ever seems to mention the Vale, which suggests to me that the Arryns have taken no part in any of this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Dorne?\u201d The Vale was far away; Dorne was close.\n\u201cPrince Doran\u2019s younger son has been betrothed to Myrcella Baratheon, which would suggest that the Dornishmen have thrown in with House Lannister, but they have an army in the Boneway and another in the Prince\u2019s Pass, just waiting\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWaiting.\u201d He frowned. \u201cFor what?\u201d Without Daenerys and her dragons, Dorne was central to their hopes. \u201cWrite Sunspear. Doran Martell must know that his sister\u2019s son is still alive and has come home to claim his father\u2019s throne.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d The Halfmaester glanced at another parchment. \u201cWe could scarcely have timed our landing better. We have potential friends and allies at every hand.\u201d\n\u201cBut no dragons,\u201d said Jon Connington, \u201cso to win these allies to our cause, we must needs have something to offer them.\u201d\n\u201cGold and land are the traditional incentives.\u201d\n\u201cWould that we had either. Promises of land and promises of gold may suffice for some, but Strickland and his men will expect first claim on the choicest fields and castles, those that were taken from their forebears when they fled into exile. No.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord does have one prize to offer,\u201d Haldon Halfmaester pointed out. \u201cPrince Aegon\u2019s hand. A marriage alliance, to bring some great House to our banners.\u201d\nA bride for our bright prince. Jon Connington remembered Prince Rhaegar\u2019s wedding all too well. Elia was never worthy of him. She was frail and sickly from the first, and childbirth only left her weaker. After the birth of Princess Rhaenys, her mother had been bedridden for half a year, and Prince Aegon\u2019s birth had almost been the death of her. She would bear no more children, the maesters told Prince Rhaegar afterward.\n\u201cDaenerys Targaryen may yet come home one day,\u201d Connington told the Halfmaester. \u201cAegon must be free to marry her.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord knows best,\u201d said Haldon. \u201cIn that case, we might consider offering potential friends a lesser prize.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you suggest?\u201d\n\u201cYou. You are unwed. A great lord, still virile, with no heirs except these cousins we have just now dispossessed, the scion of an ancient House with a fine stout castle and wide, rich lands that will no doubt be restored and perhaps expanded by a grateful king, once we have triumphed. You have a name as a warrior, and as King Aegon\u2019s Hand you will speak with his voice and rule this realm in all but name. I would think that many an ambitious lord might be eager to wed his daughter to such a man. Even, perhaps, the prince of Dorne.\u201d\nJon Connington\u2019s answer was a long cold stare. There were times when the Halfmaester vexed him almost as much as that dwarf had. \u201cI think not.\u201d Death is creeping up my arm. No man must ever know, nor any wife. He got back to his feet. \u201cPrepare the letter to Prince Doran.\u201d\n\u201cAs my lord commands.\u201d\nJon Connington slept that night in the lord\u2019s chambers, in the bed that had once been his father\u2019s, beneath a dusty canopy of red-and-white velvet. He woke at dawn to the sound of falling rain and the timid knock of a serving man anxious to learn how his new lord would break his fast. \u201cBoiled eggs, fried bread, and beans. And a jug of wine. The worst wine in the cellar.\u201d\n\u201cThe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the worst, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\nWhen the food and wine had been brought up, he barred the door, emptied the jug into a bowl, and soaked his hand in it. Vinegar soaks and vinegar baths were the treatment Lady Lemore had prescribed for the dwarf, when she feared he might have greyscale, but asking for a jug of vinegar each morning would give the game away. Wine would need to serve, though he saw no sense in wasting a good vintage. The nails on all four fingers were black now, though not yet on his thumb. On the middle finger, the grey had crept up past the second knuckle. I should hack them off, he thought, but how would I explain two missing fingers? He dare not let the greyscale become known. Queer as it seemed, men who would cheerfully face battle and risk death to rescue a companion would abandon that same companion in a heartbeat if he were known to have greyscale. I should have let the damned dwarf drown.\nLater that day, garbed and gloved once more, Connington made an inspection of the castle and sent word to Homeless Harry Strickland and his captains to join him for a war council. Nine of them assembled in the solar: Connington and Strickland, Haldon Halfmaester, Black Balaq, Ser Franklyn Flowers, Malo Jayn, Ser Brendel Byrne, Dick Cole, and Lymond Pease. The Halfmaester had good tidings. \u201cWord\u2019s reached the camp from Marq Mandrake. The Volantenes put him ashore on what turned out to be Estermont, with close to five hundred men. He\u2019s taken Greenstone.\u201d\nEstermont was an island off Cape Wrath, never one of their objectives. \u201cThe damned Volantenes are so eager to be rid of us they are dumping us ashore on any bit of land they see,\u201d said Franklyn Flowers. \u201cI\u2019ll wager you that we\u2019ve got lads scattered all over half the bloody Stepstones too.\u201d\n\u201cWith my elephants,\u201d Harry Strickland said, in a mournful tone. He missed his elephants, did Homeless Harry.\n\u201cMandrake had no archers with him,\u201d said Lymond Pease. \u201cDo we know if Greenstone got off any ravens before it fell?\u201d\n\u201cI expect they did,\u201d said Jon Connington, \u201cbut what messages would they have carried? At best, some garbled account of raiders from the sea.\u201d Even before they had sailed from Volon Therys, he had instructed his captains to show no banners during these first attacks\u2014not Prince Aegon\u2019s three-headed dragon, nor his own griffins, nor the skulls and golden battle standards of the company. Let the Lannisters suspect Stannis Baratheon, pirates from the Stepstones, outlaws out of the woods, or whoever else they cared to blame. If the reports that reached King\u2019s Landing were confused and contradictory, so much the better. The slower the Iron Throne was to react, the longer they would have to gather their strength and bring allies to the cause. There should be ships on Estermont. It is an island. Haldon, send word to Mandrake to leave a garrison behind and bring the rest of his men over to Cape Wrath, along with any noble captives.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, my lord. House Estermont has blood ties to both kings, as it happens. Good hostages.\u201d\n\u201cGood ransoms,\u201d said Homeless Harry, happily.\n\u201cIt is time we sent for Prince Aegon as well,\u201d Lord Jon announced. \u201cHe will be safer here behind the walls of Griffin\u2019s Roost than back at camp.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send a rider,\u201d said Franklyn Flowers, \u201cbut the lad won\u2019t much like the idea of staying safe, I tell you that. He wants to be in the thick o\u2019 things.\u201d\nSo did we all at his age, Lord Jon thought, remembering.\n\u201cHas the time come to raise his banner?\u201d asked Pease.\n\u201cNot yet. Let King\u2019s Landing think this is no more than an exile lord coming home with some hired swords to reclaim his birthright. An old familiar story, that. I will even write King Tommen, stating as much and asking for a pardon and the restoration of my lands and titles. That will give them something to chew over for a while. And whilst they dither, we will send out word secretly to likely friends in the stormlands and the Reach. And Dorne.\u201d That was the crucial step. Lesser lords might join their cause for fear of harm or hope of gain, but only the Prince of Dorne had the power to defy House Lannister and its allies. \u201cAbove all else, we must have Doran Martell.\u201d\n\u201cSmall chance of that,\u201d said Strickland. \u201cThe Dornishman is scared of his own shadow. Not what you call daring.\u201d\nNo more than you. \u201cPrince Doran is a cautious man, that\u2019s true. He will never join us unless he is convinced that we will win. So to persuade him we must show our strength.\u201d\n\u201cIf Peake and Rivers are successful, we will control the better part of Cape Wrath,\u201d argued Strickland. \u201cFour castles in as many days, that\u2019s a splendid start, but we are still only at half strength. We need to wait for the rest of my men. We are missing horses as well, and the elephants. Wait, I say. Gather our power, win some small lords to our cause, let Lysono Maar dispatch his spies to learn what we can learn of our foes.\u201d\nConnington gave the plump captain-general a cool look. This man is no Blackheart, no Bittersteel, no Maelys. He would wait until all seven hells were frozen if he could rather than risk another bout of blisters. \u201cWe did not cross half the world to wait. Our best chance is to strike hard and fast, before King\u2019s Landing knows who we are. I mean to take Storm\u2019s End. A nigh-impregnable stronghold, and Stannis Baratheon\u2019s last foothold in the south. Once taken, it will give us a secure fastness to which we may retreat at need, and winning it will prove our strength.\u201d\nThe captains of the Golden Company exchanged glances. \u201cIf Storm\u2019s End is still held by men loyal to Stannis, we will be taking it from him, not the Lannisters,\u201d objected Brendel Byrne. \u201cWhy not make common cause with him against the Lannisters?\u201d\n\u201cStannis is Robert\u2019s brother, of that same ilk that brought down House Targaryen,\u201d Jon Connington reminded him. \u201cMoreover, he is a thousand leagues away, with whatever meagre strength he still commands. The whole realm lies between us. It would take half a year just to reach him, and he has little and less to offer us.\u201d\n\u201cIf Storm\u2019s End is so impregnable, how do you mean to take it?\u201d asked Malo.\n\u201cBy guile.\u201d\nHomeless Harry Strickland disagreed. \u201cWe should wait.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall.\u201d Jon Connington stood. \u201cTen days. No longer. It will take that long to prepare. On the morning of the eleventh day, we ride for Storm\u2019s End.\u201d\nThe prince arrived to join them four days later, riding at the head of a column of a hundred horse, with three elephants lumbering in his rear. Lady Lemore was with him, garbed once more in the white robes of a septa. Before them went Ser Rolly Duckfield, a snow-white cloak streaming from his shoulders.\nA solid man, and true, Connington thought as he watched Duck dismount, but not worthy of the Kingsguard. He had tried his best to dissuade the prince from giving Duckfield that cloak, pointing out that the honor might best be held in reserve for warriors of greater renown whose fealty would add luster to their cause, and the younger sons of great lords whose support they would need in the coming struggle, but the boy would not be moved. \u201cDuck will die for me if need be,\u201d he had said, \u201cand that\u2019s all I require in my Kingsguard. The Kingslayer was a warrior of great renown, and the son of a great lord as well.\u201d\nAt least I convinced him to leave the other six slots open, else Duck might have six ducklings trailing after him, each more blindingly adequate than the last. \u201cEscort His Grace to my solar,\u201d he commanded. \u201cAt once.\u201d\nPrince Aegon Targaryen was not near as biddable as the boy Young Griff had been, however. The better part of an hour had passed before he finally turned up in the solar, with Duck at his side. \u201cLord Connington,\u201d he said, \u201cI like your castle.\u201d\n\u201cYour father\u2019s lands are beautiful,\u201d he said. His silvery hair was blowing in the wind, and his eyes were a deep purple, darker than this boy\u2019s. \u201cAs do I, Your Grace. Please, be seated. Ser Rolly, we\u2019ll have no further need of you for now.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I want Duck to stay.\u201d The prince sat. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking with Strickland and Flowers. They told us about this attack on Storm\u2019s End that you\u2019re planning.\u201d\nJon Connington did not let his fury show. \u201cAnd did Homeless Harry try to persuade you to delay it?\u201d\n\u201cHe did, actually,\u201d the prince said, \u201cbut I won\u2019t. Harry\u2019s an old maid, isn\u2019t he? You have the right of it, my lord. I want the attack to go ahead\u00a0\u2026\u00a0with one change. I mean to lead it.\u201d",

      "content": "THE SACRIFICE\nOn the village green, the queen\u2019s men built their pyre.\nOr should it be the village white? The snow was knee deep everywhere but where the men had shoveled it away, to hack holes into the frozen ground with axe and spade and pick. The wind was swirling from the west, driving still more snow across the frozen surface of the lakes.\n\u201cYou do not want to watch this,\u201d Aly Mormont said.\n\u201cNo, but I will.\u201d Asha Greyjoy was the kraken\u2019s daughter, not some pampered maiden who could not bear to look at ugliness.\nIt had been a dark, cold, hungry day, like the day before and the day before that. They had spent most of it out on the ice, shivering beside a pair of holes they\u2019d cut in the smaller of the frozen lakes, with fishing lines clutched in mitten-clumsy hands. Not long ago, they could count on hooking one or two fish apiece, and wolfswood men more practiced at ice-fishing were pulling up four or five. Today all that Asha had come back with was a chill that went bone deep. Aly had fared no better. It had been three days since either of them had caught a fish.\nThe She-Bear tried again. \u201cI do not need to watch this.\u201d\nIt is not you the queen\u2019s men want to burn. \u201cThen go. You have my word, I will not run. Where would I go? To Winterfell?\u201d Asha laughed. \u201cOnly three days\u2019 ride, they tell me.\u201d\nSix queen\u2019s men were wrestling two enormous pinewood poles into holes six other queen\u2019s men had dug out. Asha did not have to ask their purpose. She knew. Stakes. Nightfall would be on them soon, and the red god must be fed. An offering of blood and fire, the queen\u2019s men called it, that the Lord of Light may turn his fiery eye upon us and melt these thrice-cursed snows.\n\u201cEven in this place of fear and darkness, the Lord of Light protects us,\u201d Ser Godry Farring told the men who gathered to watch as the stakes were hammered down into the holes.\n\u201cWhat has your southron god to do with snow?\u201d demanded Artos Flint. His black beard was crusted with ice. \u201cThis is the wroth of the old gods come upon us. It is them we should appease.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Big Bucket Wull. \u201cRed Rahloo means nothing here. You will only make the old gods angry. They are watching from their island.\u201d\nThe crofter\u2019s village stood between two lakes, the larger dotted with small wooded islands that punched up through the ice like the frozen fists of some drowned giant. From one such island rose a weirwood gnarled and ancient, its bole and branches white as the surrounding snows. Eight days ago Asha had walked out with Aly Mormont to have a closer look at its slitted red eyes and bloody mouth. It is only sap, she\u2019d told herself, the red sap that flows inside these weirwoods. But her eyes were unconvinced; seeing was believing, and what they saw was frozen blood.\n\u201cYou northmen brought these snows upon us,\u201d insisted Corliss Penny. \u201cYou and your demon trees. R\u2019hllor will save us.\u201d\n\u201cR\u2019hllor will doom us,\u201d said Artos Flint.\nA pox on both your gods, thought Asha Greyjoy.\nSer Godry the Giantslayer surveyed the stakes, shoving one to make certain it was firmly placed. \u201cGood. Good. They will serve. Ser Clayton, bring forth the sacrifice.\u201d\nSer Clayton Suggs was Godry\u2019s strong right hand. Or should it be his withered arm? Asha did not like Ser Clayton. Where Farring seemed fierce in his devotion to his red god, Suggs was simply cruel. She had seen him at the nightfires, watching, his lips parted and his eyes avid. It is not the god he loves, it is the flames, she concluded. When she asked Ser Justin if Suggs had always been that way, he grimaced. \u201cOn Dragonstone he would gamble with the torturers and lend them a hand in the questioning of prisoners, especially if the prisoner were a young woman.\u201d\nAsha was not surprised. Suggs would take a special delight in burning her, she did not doubt. Unless the storms let up.\nThey had been three days from Winterfell for nineteen days. One hundred leagues from Deepwood Motte to Winterfell. Three hundred miles as the raven flies. But none of them were ravens, and the storm was unrelenting. Each morning Asha awoke hoping she might see the sun, only to face another day of snow. The storm had buried every hut and hovel beneath a mound of dirty snow, and the drifts would soon be deep enough to engulf the longhall too.\nAnd there was no food, beyond their failing horses, fish taken from the lakes (fewer every day), and whatever meagre sustenance their foragers could find in these cold, dead woods. With the king\u2019s knights and lords claiming the lion\u2019s share of the horsemeat, little and less remained for the common men. Small wonder then that they had started eating their own dead.\nAsha had been as horrified as the rest when the She-Bear told her that four Peasebury men had been found butchering one of the late Lord Fell\u2019s, carving chunks of flesh from his thighs and buttocks as one of his forearms turned upon a spit, but she could not pretend to be surprised. The four were not the first to taste human flesh during this grim march, she would wager\u2014only the first to be discovered.\nPeasebury\u2019s four would pay for their feast with their lives, by the king\u2019s decree\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and by burning end the storm, the queen\u2019s men claimed. Asha Greyjoy put no faith in their red god, yet she prayed they had the right of that. If not, there would be other pyres, and Ser Clayton Suggs might get his heart\u2019s desire.\nThe four flesh-eaters were naked when Ser Clayton drove them out, their wrists lashed behind their backs with leathern cords. The youngest of them wept as he stumbled through the snow. Two others walked like men already dead, eyes fixed upon the ground. Asha was surprised to see how ordinary they appeared. Not monsters, she realized, only men.\nThe oldest of the four had been their serjeant. He alone remained defiant, spitting venom at the queen\u2019s men as they prodded him along with their spears. \u201cFuck you all, and fuck your red god too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear me, Farring? Giantslayer? I laughed when your fucking cousin died, Godry. We should have eaten him too, he smelled so good when they roasted him. I bet the boy was nice and tender. Juicy.\u201d A blow from a spear butt drove the man to his knees but did not silence him. When he rose he spat out a mouthful of blood and broken teeth and went right on. \u201cThe cock\u2019s the choicest part, all crisped up on the spit. A fat little sausage.\u201d Even as they wrapped the chains around him, he raved on. \u201cCorliss Penny, come over here. What sort of name is Penny? Is that how much your mother charged? And you, Suggs, you bleeding bastard, you\u2014\u201d\nSer Clayton never said a word. One quick slash opened the serjeant\u2019s throat, sending a wash of blood down his chest.\nThe weeping man wept harder, his body shaking with each sob. He was so thin that Asha could count every rib. \u201cNo,\u201d he begged, \u201cplease, he was dead, he was dead and we was hungry, please\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe serjeant was the clever one,\u201d Asha said to Aly Mormont. \u201cHe goaded Suggs into killing him.\u201d She wondered if the same trick might work twice, should her own turn come.\nThe four victims were chained up back-to-back, two to a stake. There they hung, three live men and one dead one, as the Lord of Light\u2019s devout stacked split logs and broken branches under their feet, then doused the piles with lamp oil. They had to be swift about it. The snow was falling heavily, as ever, and the wood would soon be soaked through.\n\u201cWhere is the king?\u201d asked Ser Corliss Penny.\nFour days ago, one of the king\u2019s own squires had succumbed to cold and hunger, a boy named Bryen Farring who\u2019d been kin to Ser Godry. Stannis Baratheon stood grim-faced by the funeral pyre as the lad\u2019s body was consigned to the flames. Afterward the king had retreated to his watchtower. He had not emerged since\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though from time to time His Grace was glimpsed upon the tower roof, outlined against the beacon fire that burned there night and day. Talking to the red god, some said. Calling out for Lady Melisandre, insisted others. Either way, it seemed to Asha Greyjoy, the king was lost and crying out for help.\n\u201cCanty, go find the king and tell him all is ready,\u201d Ser Godry said to the nearest man-at-arms.\n\u201cThe king is here.\u201d The voice was Richard Horpe\u2019s.\nOver his armor of plate and mail Ser Richard wore his quilted doublet, blazoned with three death\u2019s-head moths on a field of ash and bone. King Stannis walked beside him. Behind them, struggling to keep pace, Arnolf Karstark came hobbling, leaning on his blackthorn cane. Lord Arnolf had found them eight days past. The northman had brought a son, three grandsons, four hundred spears, two score archers, a dozen mounted lances, a maester, and a cage of ravens\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but only enough provisions to sustain his own.\nKarstark was no lord in truth, Asha had been given to understand, only castellan of Karhold for as long as the true lord remained a captive of the Lannisters. Gaunt and bent and crooked, with a left shoulder half a foot higher than his right, he had a scrawny neck, squinty grey eyes, and yellow teeth. A few white hairs were all that separated him from baldness; his forked beard was equal parts white and grey, but always ragged. Asha thought there was something sour about his smiles. Yet if the talk was true, it was Karstark who would hold Winterfell should they take it. Somewhere in the distant past House Karstark had sprouted from House Stark, and Lord Arnolf had been the first of Eddard Stark\u2019s bannermen to declare for Stannis.\nSo far as Asha knew, the gods of the Karstarks were the old gods of the north, gods they shared with the Wulls, the Norreys, the Flints, and the other hill clans. She wondered if Lord Arnolf had come to view the burning at the king\u2019s behest, that he might witness the power of the red god for himself.\nAt the sight of Stannis, two of the men bound to the stakes began to plead for mercy. The king listened in silence, his jaw clenched. Then he said to Godry Farring, \u201cYou may begin.\u201d\nThe Giantslayer raised his arms. \u201cLord of Light, hear us.\u201d\n\u201cLord of Light, defend us,\u201d the queen\u2019s men chanted, \u201cfor the night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d\nSer Godry raised his head toward the darkening sky. \u201cWe thank you for the sun that warms us and pray that you will return it to us, Oh lord, that it might light our path to your enemies.\u201d Snowflakes melted on his face. \u201cWe thank you for the stars that watch over us by night, and pray that you will rip away this veil that hides them, so we might glory in their sight once more.\u201d\n\u201cLord of Light, protect us,\u201d the queen\u2019s men prayed, \u201cand keep this savage dark at bay.\u201d\nSer Corliss Penny stepped forward, clutching the torch with both hands. He swung it about his head in a circle, fanning the flames. One of the captives began to whimper.\n\u201cR\u2019hllor,\u201d Ser Godry sang, \u201cwe give you now four evil men. With glad hearts and true, we give them to your cleansing fires, that the darkness in their souls might be burned away. Let their vile flesh be seared and blackened, that their spirits might rise free and pure to ascend into the light. Accept their blood, Oh lord, and melt the icy chains that bind your servants. Hear their pain, and grant strength to our swords that we might shed the blood of your enemies. Accept this sacrifice, and show us the way to Winterfell, that we might vanquish the unbelievers.\u201d\n\u201cLord of Light, accept this sacrifice,\u201d a hundred voices echoed. Ser Corliss lit the first pyre with the torch, then thrust it into the wood at the base of the second. A few wisps of smoke began to rise. The captives began to cough. The first flames appeared, shy as maidens, darting and dancing from log to leg. In moments both the stakes were engulfed in fire.\n\u201cHe was dead,\u201d the weeping boy screamed, as the flames licked up his legs. \u201cWe found him dead\u00a0\u2026\u00a0please\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we was hungry\u00a0\u2026\u201d The fires reached his balls. As the hair around his cock began to burn, his pleading dissolved into one long wordless shriek.\nAsha Greyjoy could taste the bile in the back of her throat. On the Iron Islands, she had seen priests of her own people slit the throats of thralls and give their bodies to the sea to honor the Drowned God. Brutal as that was, this was worse.\nClose your eyes, she told herself. Close your ears. Turn away. You do not need to see this. The queen\u2019s men were singing some paean of praise for red R\u2019hllor, but she could not hear the words above the shrieks. The heat of the flames beat against her face, but even so she shivered. The air grew thick with smoke and the stink of burnt flesh, and one of the bodies still twitched against the red-hot chains that bound him to the stake.\nAfter a time the screaming stopped.\nWordless, King Stannis walked away, back to the solitude of his watchtower. Back to his beacon fire, Asha knew, to search the flames for answers. Arnolf Karstark made to hobble after him, but Ser Richard Horpe took him by the arm and turned him toward the longhall. The watchers began to drift away, each to his own fire and whatever meagre supper he might find.\nClayton Suggs sidled up beside her. \u201cDid the iron cunt enjoy the show?\u201d His breath stank of ale and onions. He has pig eyes, Asha thought. That was fitting; his shield and surcoat showed a pig with wings. Suggs pressed his face so close to hers that she could count the blackheads on his nose and said, \u201cThe crowd will be even bigger when it\u2019s you squirming on a stake.\u201d\nHe was not wrong. The wolves did not love her; she was ironborn and must answer for the crimes of her people, for Moat Cailin and Deepwood Motte and Torrhen\u2019s Square, for centuries of reaving along the stony shore, for all Theon did at Winterfell.\n\u201cUnhand me, ser.\u201d Every time Suggs spoke to her, it left her yearning for her axes. Asha was as good a finger dancer as any man on the isles and had ten fingers to prove it. If only I could dance with this one. Some men had faces that cried out for a beard. Ser Clayton\u2019s face cried out for an axe between the eyes. But she was axeless here, so the best that she could do was try to wrench away. That just made Ser Clayton grasp her all the tighter, gloved fingers digging into her arm like iron claws.\n\u201cMy lady asked you to let her go,\u201d said Aly Mormont. \u201cYou would do well to listen, ser. Lady Asha is not for burning.\u201d\n\u201cShe will be,\u201d Suggs insisted. \u201cWe have harbored this demon worshiper amongst us too long.\u201d He released his grip on Asha\u2019s arm all the same. One did not provoke the She-Bear needlessly.\nThat was the moment Justin Massey chose to appear. \u201cThe king has other plans for his prize captive,\u201d he said, with his easy smile. His cheeks were red from the cold.\n\u201cThe king? Or you?\u201d Suggs snorted his contempt. \u201cScheme all you like, Massey. She\u2019ll still be for the fire, her and her king\u2019s blood. There\u2019s power in king\u2019s blood, the red woman used to say. Power to please our lord.\u201d\n\u201cLet R\u2019hllor be content with the four we just sent him.\u201d\n\u201cFour baseborn churls. A beggar\u2019s offering. Scum like that will never stop the snow. She might.\u201d\nThe She-Bear spoke. \u201cAnd if you burn her and the snows still fall, what then? Who will you burn next? Me?\u201d\nAsha could hold her tongue no longer. \u201cWhy not Ser Clayton? Perhaps R\u2019hllor would like one of his own. A faithful man who will sing his praises as the flames lick at his cock.\u201d\nSer Justin laughed. Suggs was less amused. \u201cEnjoy your giggle, Massey. If the snow keeps falling, we will see who is laughing then.\u201d He glanced at the dead men on their stakes, smiled, and went off to join Ser Godry and the other queen\u2019s men.\n\u201cMy champion,\u201d Asha said to Justin Massey. He deserved that much, whatever his motives. \u201cThank you for the rescue, ser.\u201d\n\u201cIt will not win you friends amongst the queen\u2019s men,\u201d said the She-Bear. \u201cHave you lost your faith in red R\u2019hllor?\u201d\n\u201cI have lost faith in more than that,\u201d Massey said, his breath a pale mist in the air, \u201cbut I still believe in supper. Will you join me, my ladies?\u201d\nAly Mormont shook her head. \u201cI have no appetite.\u201d\n\u201cNor I. But you had best choke down some horsemeat all the same, or you may soon wish you had. We had eight hundred horses when we marched from Deepwood Motte. Last night the count was sixty-four.\u201d\nThat did not shock her. Almost all of their big destriers had failed, including Massey\u2019s own. Most of their palfreys were gone as well. Even the garrons of the northmen were faltering for want of fodder. But what did they need horses for? Stannis was no longer marching anywhere. The sun and moon and stars had been gone so long that Asha was starting to wonder whether she had dreamed them. \u201cI will eat.\u201d\nAly shook her head. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\u201cLet me look after Lady Asha, then,\u201d Ser Justin told her. \u201cYou have my word, I shall not permit her to escape.\u201d\nThe She-Bear gave her grudging assent, deaf to the japery in his tone. They parted there, Aly to her tent, she and Justin Massey to the longhall. It was not far, but the drifts were deep, the wind was gusty, and Asha\u2019s feet were blocks of ice. Her ankle stabbed at her with every step.\nSmall and mean as it was, the longhall was the largest building in the village, so the lords and captains had taken it for themselves, whilst Stannis settled into the stone watchtower by the lakeshore. A pair of guardsmen flanked its door, leaning on tall spears. One lifted the greased door flap for Massey, and Ser Justin escorted Asha through to the blessed warmth within.\nBenches and trestle tables ran along either side of the hall, with room for fifty men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though twice that number had squeezed themselves inside. A fire trench had been dug down the middle of the earthen floor, with a row of smokeholes in the roof above. The wolves had taken to sitting on one side of the trench, the knights and southron lords upon the other.\nThe southerners looked a sorry lot, Asha thought\u2014gaunt and hollow-cheeked, some pale and sick, others with red and wind-scoured faces. By contrast the northmen seemed hale and healthy, big ruddy men with beards as thick as bushes, clad in fur and iron. They might be cold and hungry too, but the marching had gone easier for them, with their garrons and their bear-paws.\nAsha peeled off her fur mittens, wincing as she flexed her fingers. Pain shot up her legs as her half-frozen feet began to thaw in the warmth. The crofters had left behind a good supply of peat when they fled, so the air was hazy with smoke and the rich, earthy smell of burning turf. She hung her cloak on a peg inside the door after shaking off the snow that clung to it.\nSer Justin found them places on the bench and fetched supper for the both of them\u2014ale and chunks of horsemeat, charred black outside and red within. Asha took a sip of ale and fell upon the horse flesh. The portion was smaller than the last she\u2019d tasted, but her belly still rumbled at the smell of it. \u201cMy thanks, ser,\u201d she said, as blood and grease ran down her chin.\n\u201cJustin. I insist.\u201d Massey cut his own meat into chunks and stabbed one with his dagger.\nDown the table, Will Foxglove was telling the men around him that Stannis would resume his march on Winterfell three days hence. He\u2019d had it from the lips of one of the grooms who tended the king\u2019s horses. \u201cHis Grace has seen victory in his fires,\u201d Foxglove said, \u201ca victory that will be sung of for a thousand years in lord\u2019s castle and peasant\u2019s hut alike.\u201d\nJustin Massey looked up from his horsemeat. \u201cThe cold count last night reached eighty.\u201d He pulled a piece of gristle from his teeth and flicked it to the nearest dog. \u201cIf we march, we will die by the hundreds.\u201d\n\u201cWe will die by the thousands if we stay here,\u201d said Ser Humfrey Clifton. \u201cPress on or die, I say.\u201d\n\u201cPress on and die, I answer. And if we reach Winterfell, what then? How do we take it? Half our men are so weak they can scarce put one foot before another. Will you set them to scaling walls? Building siege towers?\u201d\n\u201cWe should remain here until the weather breaks,\u201d said Ser Ormund Wylde, a cadaverous old knight whose nature gave the lie to his name. Asha had heard rumors that some of the men-at-arms were wagering on which of the great knights and lords would be the next to die. Ser Ormund had emerged as a clear favorite. And how much coin was placed on me, I wonder? Asha thought. Perhaps there is still time to put down a wager. \u201cHere at least we have some shelter,\u201d Wylde was insisting, \u201cand there are fish in the lakes.\u201d\n\u201cToo few fish and too many fishermen,\u201d Lord Peasebury said gloomily. He had good reason for gloom; it was his men Ser Godry had just burned, and there were some in this very hall who had been heard to say that Peasebury himself surely knew what they were doing and might even have shared in their feasts.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d grumbled Ned Woods, one of the scouts from Deepwood. Noseless Ned, he was called; frostbite had claimed the tip of his nose two winters past. Woods knew the wolfwood as well as any man alive. Even the king\u2019s proudest lords had learned to listen when he spoke. \u201cI know them lakes. You been on them like maggots on a corpse, hundreds o\u2019 you. Cut so many holes in the ice it\u2019s a bloody wonder more haven\u2019t fallen through. Out by the island, there\u2019s places look like a cheese the rats been at.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLakes are done. You fished them out.\u201d\n\u201cAll the more reason to march,\u201d insisted Humfrey Clifton. \u201cIf death is our fate, let us die with swords in hand.\u201d\nIt was the same argument as last night and the night before. Press on and die, stay here and die, fall back and die.\n\u201cFeel free to perish as you wish, Humfrey,\u201d said Justin Massey. \u201cMyself, I would sooner live to see another spring.\u201d\n\u201cSome might call that craven,\u201d Lord Peasebury replied.\n\u201cBetter a craven than a cannibal.\u201d\nPeasebury\u2019s face twisted in sudden fury. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDeath is part of war, Justin.\u201d Ser Richard Horpe stood inside the door, his dark hair damp with melting snow. \u201cThose who march with us will have a share in all the plunder we take from Bolton and his bastard, and a greater share of glory undying. Those too weak to march must fend for themselves. But you have my word, we shall send food once we have taken Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cYou will not take Winterfell!\u201d\n\u201cAye, we will,\u201d came a cackle from the high table, where Arnolf Karstark sat with his son Arthor and three grandsons. Lord Arnolf shoved himself up, a vulture rising from its prey. One spotted hand clutched at his son\u2019s shoulder for support. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it for the Ned and for his daughter. Aye, and for the Young Wolf too, him who was so cruelly slaughtered. Me and mine will show the way, if need be. I\u2019ve said as much to His Good Grace the king. March, I said, and before the moon can turn, we\u2019ll all be bathing in the blood of Freys and Boltons.\u201d\nMen began to stamp their feet, to pound their fists against the tabletop. Almost all were northmen, Asha noted. Across the fire trench, the southron lords sat silent on the benches.\nJustin Massey waited until the uproar had died away. Then he said, \u201cYour courage is admirable, Lord Karstark, but courage will not breach the walls of Winterfell. How do you mean to take the castle, pray? With snowballs?\u201d\nOne of Lord Arnolf\u2019s grandsons gave answer. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut down trees for rams to break the gates.\u201d\n\u201cAnd die.\u201d\nAnother grandson made himself heard. \u201cWe\u2019ll make ladders, scale the walls.\u201d\n\u201cAnd die.\u201d\nUp spoke Arthor Karstark, Lord Arnolf\u2019s younger son. \u201cWe\u2019ll raise siege towers.\u201d\n\u201cAnd die, and die, and die.\u201d Ser Justin rolled his eyes. \u201cGods be good, are all you Karstarks mad?\u201d\n\u201cGods?\u201d said Richard Horpe. \u201cYou forget yourself, Justin. We have but one god here. Speak not of demons in this company. Only the Lord of Light can save us now. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d He put his hand upon the hilt of his sword, as if for emphasis, but his eyes never left the face of Justin Massey.\nBeneath that gaze, Ser Justin wilted. \u201cThe Lord of Light, aye. My faith runs as deep as your own, Richard, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cIt is your courage I question, Justin, not your faith. You have preached defeat every step of the way since we rode forth from Deepwood Motte. It makes me wonder whose side you are on.\u201d\nA flush crept up Massey\u2019s neck. \u201cI will not stay here to be insulted.\u201d He wrenched his damp cloak down from the wall so hard that Asha heard it tear, then stalked past Horpe and through the door. A blast of cold air blew through the hall, raising ashes from the fire trench and fanning its flames a little brighter.\nBroken quick as that, thought Asha. My champion is made of suet. Even so, Ser Justin was one of the few who might object should the queen\u2019s men try to burn her. So she rose to her feet, donned her own cloak, and followed him out into the blizzard.\nShe was lost before she had gone ten yards. Asha could see the beacon fire burning atop the watchtower, a faint orange glow floating in the air. Elsewise the village was gone. She was alone in a white world of snow and silence, plowing through snowdrifts as high as her thighs. \u201cJustin?\u201d she called. There was no answer. Somewhere to her left she heard a horse whicker. The poor thing sounds frightened. Perhaps he knows that he\u2019s to be tomorrow\u2019s supper. Asha pulled her cloak about her tightly.\nShe blundered back onto the village green unknowing. The pinewood stakes still stood, charred and scorched but not burned through. The chains about the dead had cooled by now, she saw, but still held the corpses fast in their iron embrace. A raven was perched atop one, pulling at the tatters of burned flesh that clung to its blackened skull. The blowing snow had covered the ashes at the base of the pyre and crept up the dead man\u2019s leg as far as his ankle. The old gods mean to bury him, Asha thought. This was no work of theirs.\n\u201cTake a good long gander, cunt,\u201d the deep voice of Clayton Suggs said, behind her. \u201cYou\u2019ll look just as pretty once you\u2019re roasted. Tell me, can squids scream?\u201d\nGod of my fathers, if you can hear me in your watery halls beneath the waves, grant me just one small throwing axe. The Drowned God did not answer. He seldom did. That was the trouble with gods. \u201cHave you seen Ser Justin?\u201d\n\u201cThat prancing fool? What do you want with him, cunt? If it\u2019s a fuck you need, I\u2019m more a man than Massey.\u201d\nCunt again? It was odd how men like Suggs used that word to demean women when it was the only part of a woman they valued. And Suggs was worse than Middle Liddle. When he says the word, he means it. \u201cYour king gelds men for rape,\u201d she reminded him.\nSer Clayton chuckled. \u201cThe king\u2019s half-blind from staring into fires. But have no fear, cunt, I\u2019ll not rape you. I\u2019d need to kill you after, and I\u2019d sooner see you burn.\u201d\nThere\u2019s that horse again. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\u201cA horse. No, horses. More than one.\u201d She turned her head, listening. The snow did queer things to sound. It was hard to know which direction it had come from.\n\u201cIs this some squid game? I don\u2019t hear\u2014\u201d Suggs scowled. \u201cBloody hell. Riders.\u201d He fumbled at his sword belt, his hands clumsy in their fur-and-leather gloves, and finally succeeded in ripping his longsword from its scabbard.\nBy then the riders were upon them.\nThey emerged from the storm like a troop of wraiths, big men on small horses, made even bigger by the bulky furs they wore. Swords rode on their hips, singing their soft steel song as they rattled in their scabbards. Asha saw a battle-axe strapped to one man\u2019s saddle, a warhammer on another\u2019s back. Shields they bore as well, but so obscured by snow and ice that the arms upon them could not be read. For all her layers of wool and fur and boiled leather, Asha felt naked standing there. A horn, she thought, I need a horn to rouse the camp.\n\u201cRun, you stupid cunt,\u201d Ser Clayton shouted. \u201cRun warn the king. Lord Bolton is upon us.\u201d A brute he might have been, but Suggs did not want for courage. Sword in hand, he strode through the snow, putting himself between the riders and the king\u2019s tower, its beacon glimmering behind him like the orange eye of some strange god. \u201cWho goes there? Halt! Halt!\u201d\nThe lead rider reined up before him. Behind were others, perhaps as many as a score. Asha had no time to count them. Hundreds more might be out there in the storm, coming hard upon their heels. Roose Bolton\u2019s entire host might be descending on them, hidden by darkness and swirling snow. These, though\u00a0\u2026\nThey are too many to be scouts and too few to make a vanguard. And two were all in black. Night\u2019s Watch, she realized suddenly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she called.\n\u201cFriends,\u201d a half-familiar voice replied. \u201cWe looked for you at Winterfell, but found only Crowfood Umber beating drums and blowing horns. It took some time to find you.\u201d The rider vaulted from his saddle, pulled back his hood, and bowed. So thick was his beard, and so crusted with ice, that for a moment Asha did not know him. Then it came. \u201cTris?\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d Tristifer Botley took a knee. \u201cThe Maid is here as well. Roggon, Grimtongue, Fingers, Rook\u00a0\u2026\u00a0six of us, all those fit enough to ride. Cromm died of his wounds.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Ser Clayton Suggs demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re one of hers? How did you get loose of Deepwood\u2019s dungeons?\u201d\nTris rose and brushed the snow from his knees. \u201cSybelle Glover was offered a handsome ransom for our freedom and chose to accept it in the name of the king.\u201d\n\u201cWhat ransom? Who would pay good coin for sea scum?\u201d\n\u201cI did, ser.\u201d The speaker came forward on his garron. He was very tall, very thin, so long-legged that it was a wonder his feet did not drag along the ground. \u201cI had need of a strong escort to see me safely to the king, and Lady Sybelle had need of fewer mouths to feed.\u201d A scarf concealed the tall man\u2019s features, but atop his head was perched the queerest hat Asha had seen since the last time she had sailed to Tyrosh, a brimless tower of some soft fabric, like three cylinders stacked one atop the other. \u201cI was given to understand that I might find King Stannis here. It is most urgent that I speak with him at once.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who in seven stinking hells are you?\u201d\nThe tall man slid gracefully from his garron, removed his peculiar hat, and bowed. \u201cI have the honor to be Tycho Nestoris, a humble servant of the Iron Bank of Braavos.\u201d\nOf all the strange things that might have come riding out of the night, the last one Asha Greyjoy would ever have expected was a Braavosi banker. It was too absurd. She had to laugh. \u201cKing Stannis has taken the watchtower for his seat. Ser Clayton will be pleased to show you to him, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be most kind. Time is of the essence.\u201d The banker studied her with shrewd dark eyes. \u201cYou are the Lady Asha of House Greyjoy, unless I am mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cI am Asha of House Greyjoy, aye. Opinions differ on whether I\u2019m a lady.\u201d\nThe Braavosi smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought a gift for you.\u201d He beckoned to the men behind him. \u201cWe had expected to find the king at Winterfell. This same blizzard has engulfed the castle, alas. Beneath its walls we found Mors Umber with a troop of raw green boys, waiting for the king\u2019s coming. He gave us this.\u201d\nA girl and an old man, thought Asha, as the two were dumped rudely in the snow before her. The girl was shivering violently, even in her furs. If she had not been so frightened, she might even have been pretty, though the tip of her nose was black with frostbite. The old man\u00a0\u2026\u00a0no one would ever think him comely. She had seen scarecrows with more flesh. His face was a skull with skin, his hair bone-white and filthy. And he stank. Just the sight of him filled Asha with revulsion.\nHe raised his eyes. \u201cSister. See. This time I knew you.\u201d\nAsha\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cTheon?\u201d\nHis lips skinned back in what might have been a grin. Half his teeth were gone, and half of those still left him were broken and splintered. \u201cTheon,\u201d he repeated. \u201cMy name is Theon. You have to know your name.\u201d",

      "content": "VICTARION\nThe sea was black and the moon was silver as the Iron Fleet swept down on the prey.\nThey sighted her in the narrows between the Isle of Cedars and the rugged hills of the Astapori hinterlands, just as the black priest Moqorro had said they would. \u201cGhiscari,\u201d Longwater Pyke shouted down from the crow\u2019s nest. Victarion Greyjoy watched her sail grow larger from the forecastle. Soon he could make out her oars rising and falling, and the long white wake behind her shining in the moonlight, like a scar across the sea.\nNot a true warship, Victarion realized. A trading galley, and a big one. She would make a fine prize. He signaled to his captains to give chase. They would board this ship and take her.\nThe captain of the galley had realized his peril by then. He changed course for the west, making for the Isle of Cedars, perhaps hoping to shelter in some hidden cove or run his pursuers onto the jagged rocks along the island\u2019s northeast coast. His galley was heavy laden, though, and the ironborn had the wind. Grief and Iron Victory cut across the quarry\u2019s course, whilst swift Sparrowhawk and agile Fingerdancer swept behind her. Even then the Ghiscari captain did not strike his banners. By the time Lamentation came alongside the prey, raking her larboard side and splintering her oars, both ships were so close to the haunted ruins of Ghozai that they could hear the monkeys chattering as the first dawn light washed over the city\u2019s broken pyramids.\nTheir prize was named Ghiscari Dawn, the galley\u2019s captain said when he was delivered to Victarion in chains. She was out of New Ghis and returning there by way of Yunkai after trading at Meereen. The man spoke no decent tongue but only a guttural Ghiscari, full of growls and hisses, as ugly a language as Victarion Greyjoy had ever heard. Moqorro translated the captain\u2019s words into the Common Tongue of Westeros. The war for Meereen was won, the captain claimed; the dragon queen was dead, and a Ghiscari by the name of Hizdak ruled the city now.\nVictarion had his tongue torn out for lying. Daenerys Targaryen was not dead, Moqorro assured him; his red god R\u2019hllor had shown him the queen\u2019s face in his sacred fires. The captain could not abide lies, so he had the Ghiscari captain bound hand and foot and thrown overboard, a sacrifice to the Drowned God. \u201cYour red god will have his due,\u201d he promised Moqorro, \u201cbut the seas are ruled by the Drowned God.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no gods but R\u2019hllor and the Other, whose name may not be said.\u201d The sorcerer priest was garbed in somber black, but for a hint of golden thread at collar, cuffs, and hem. There was no red cloth aboard the Iron Victory, but it was not meet that Moqorro go about in the salt-stained rags he had been wearing when the Vole fished him from the sea, so Victarion had commanded Tom Tidewood to sew new robes for him from whatever was at hand, and had even donated some of his own tunics to the purpose. Of black and gold those were, for the arms of House Greyjoy showed a golden kraken on a black field, and the banners and sails of their ships displayed the same. The crimson-and-scarlet robes of the red priests were alien to the ironborn, but Victarion had hoped his men might accept Moqorro more easily once clad in Greyjoy colors.\nHe hoped in vain. Clad in black from head to heel, with a mask of red-and-orange flames tattooed across his face, the priest appeared more sinister than ever. The crew shunned him when he walked the deck, and men would spit if his shadow chanced to fall upon them. Even the Vole, who had fished the red priest from the sea, had urged Victarion to give him to the Drowned God.\nBut Moqorro knew these strange shores in ways the ironborn did not, and secrets of the dragonkind as well. The Crow\u2019s Eye keeps wizards, why shouldn\u2019t I? His black sorcerer was more puissant than all of Euron\u2019s three, even if you threw them in a pot and boiled them down to one. The Damphair might disapprove, but Aeron and his pieties were far away.\nSo Victarion closed his burned hand into a mighty fist, and said, \u201cGhiscari Dawn is no fit name for a ship of the Iron Fleet. For you, wizard, I shall rename her Red God\u2019s Wroth.\u201d\nHis wizard bowed his head. \u201cAs the captain says.\u201d And the ships of the Iron Fleet numbered four-and-fifty once again.\nThe next day a sudden squall descended on them. Moqorro had predicted that as well. When the rains moved on, three ships were found to have vanished. Victarion had no way to know whether they had foundered, run aground, or been blown off course. \u201cThey know where we are going,\u201d he told his crew. \u201cIf they are still afloat, we will meet again.\u201d The iron captain had no time to wait for laggards. Not with his bride encircled by her enemies. The most beautiful woman in the world has urgent need of my axe.\nBesides, Moqorro assured him that the three ships were not lost. Each night, the sorcerer priest would kindle a fire on the forecastle of the Iron Victory and stalk around the flames, chanting prayers. The firelight made his black skin shine like polished onyx, and sometimes Victarion could swear that the flames tattooed on his face were dancing too, twisting and bending, melting into one another, their colors changing with every turn of the priest\u2019s head.\n\u201cThe black priest is calling demons down on us,\u201d one oarsman was heard to say. When that was reported to Victarion, he had the man scourged until his back was blood from shoulders to buttocks. So when Moqorro said, \u201cYour lost lambs will return to the flock off the isle called Yaros,\u201d the captain said, \u201cPray that they do, priest. Or you may be the next to taste the whip.\u201d\nThe sea was blue and green and the sun blazing down from an empty blue sky when the Iron Fleet took its second prize, in the waters north and west of Astapor.\nThis time it was a Myrish cog named Dove, on her way to Yunkai by way of New Ghis with a cargo of carpets, sweet green wines, and Myrish lace. Her captain owned a Myrish eye that made far-off things look close\u2014two glass lenses in a series of brass tubes, cunningly wrought so that each section slid into the next, until the eye was no longer than a dirk. Victarion claimed that treasure for himself. The cog he renamed Shrike. Her crew would be kept for ransom, the captain decreed. They were neither slaves nor slavers, but free Myrmen and seasoned sailors. Such men were worth good coin. Sailing out of Myr, the Dove brought them no fresh news of Meereen or Daenerys, only stale reports of Dothraki horsemen along the Rhoyne, the Golden Company upon the march, and others things Victarion already knew.\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d the captain asked his black priest that night, as Moqorro stood before his nightfire. \u201cWhat awaits us on the morrow? More rain?\u201d It smelled like rain to him.\n\u201cGrey skies and strong winds,\u201d Moqorro said. \u201cNo rain. Behind come the tigers. Ahead awaits your dragon.\u201d\nYour dragon. Victarion liked the sound of that. \u201cTell me something that I do not know, priest.\u201d\n\u201cThe captain commands, and I obey,\u201d said Moqorro. The crew had taken to calling him the Black Flame, a name fastened on him by Steffar Stammerer, who could not say \u201cMoqorro.\u201d By any name, the priest had powers. \u201cThe coastline here runs west to east,\u201d he told Victarion. \u201cWhere it turns north, you will come on two more hares. Swift ones, with many legs.\u201d\nAnd so it came to pass. This time the prey proved to be a pair of galleys, long and sleek and fast. Ralf the Limper was the first to sight them, but they soon outdistanced Woe and Forlorn Hope, so Victarion sent Iron Wing, Sparrowhawk, and Kraken\u2019s Kiss to run them down. He had no swifter ships than those three. The pursuit lasted the best part of the day, but in the end both galleys were boarded and taken, after brief but brutal fights. They had been running empty, Victarion learned, making for New Ghis to load supplies and weapons for the Ghiscari legions encamped before Meereen\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and to bring fresh legionaries to the war, to replace all the men who\u2019d died. \u201cMen slain in battle?\u201d asked Victarion. The crews of the galleys denied it; the deaths were from a bloody flux. The pale mare, they called it. And like the captain of the Ghiscari Dawn, the captains of the galleys repeated the lie that Daenerys Targaryen was dead.\n\u201cGive her a kiss for me in whatever hell you find her,\u201d Victarion said. He called for his axe and took their heads off there and then. Afterward he put their crews to death as well, saving only the slaves chained to the oars. He broke their chains himself and told them they were now free men and would have the privilege of rowing for the Iron Fleet, an honor that every boy in the Iron Islands dreamed of growing up. \u201cThe dragon queen frees slaves and so do I,\u201d he proclaimed.\nThe galleys he renamed Ghost and Shade. \u201cFor I mean them to return and haunt these Yunkishmen,\u201d he told the dusky woman that night after he had taken his pleasure of her. They were close now, and growing closer every day. \u201cWe will fall upon them like a thunderbolt,\u201d he said, as he squeezed the woman\u2019s breast. He wondered if this was how his brother Aeron felt when the Drowned God spoke to him. He could almost hear the god\u2019s voice welling up from the depths of the sea. You shall serve me well, my captain, the waves seemed to say. It was for this I made you.\nBut he would feed the red god too, Moqorro\u2019s fire god. The arm the priest had healed was hideous to look upon, pork crackling from elbow to fingertips. Sometimes when Victarion closed his hand the skin would split and smoke, yet the arm was stronger than it had ever been. \u201cTwo gods are with me now,\u201d he told the dusky woman. \u201cNo foe can stand before two gods.\u201d Then he rolled her on her back and took her once again.\nWhen the cliffs of Yaros appeared off their larboard bows, he found his three lost ships waiting for him, just as Moqorro had promised. Victarion gave the priest a golden torque as a reward.\nNow he had a choice to make: should he risk the straits, or take the Iron Fleet around the island? The memory of Fair Isle still rankled in the iron captain\u2019s memory. Stannis Baratheon had descended on the Iron Fleet from both north and south whilst they were trapped in the channel between the island and the mainland, dealing Victarion his most crushing defeat. But sailing around Yaros would cost him precious days. With Yunkai so near, shipping in the straits was like to be heavy, but he did not expect to encounter Yunkish warships until they were closer to Meereen.\nWhat would the Crow\u2019s Eye do? He brooded on that for a time, then signaled to his captains. \u201cWe sail the straits.\u201d\nThree more prizes were taken before Yaros dwindled off their sterns. A fat galleas fell to the Vole and Grief, and a trading galley to Manfryd Merlyn of Kite. Their holds were packed with trade goods, wines and silks and spices, rare woods and rarer scents, but the ships themselves were the true prize. Later that same day, a fishing ketch was taken by Seven Skulls and Thrall\u2019s Bane. She was a small, slow, dingy thing, hardly worth the effort of boarding. Victarion was displeased to hear that it had taken two of his own ships to bring the fishermen to heel. Yet it was from their lips that he heard of the black dragon\u2019s return. \u201cThe silver queen is gone,\u201d the ketch\u2019s master told him. \u201cShe flew away upon her dragon, beyond the Dothraki sea.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is this Dothraki sea?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI will sail the Iron Fleet across it and find the queen wherever she may be.\u201d\nThe fisherman laughed aloud. \u201cThat would be a sight worth seeing. The Dothraki sea is made of grass, fool.\u201d\nHe should not have said that. Victarion took him around the throat with his burned hand and lifted him bodily into the air. Slamming him back against the mast, he squeezed till the Yunkishman\u2019s face turned as black as the fingers digging into his flesh. The man kicked and writhed for a while, trying fruitlessly to pry loose the captain\u2019s grip. \u201cNo man calls Victarion Greyjoy a fool and lives to boast of it.\u201d When he opened his hand, the man\u2019s limp body flopped to the deck. Longwater Pyke and Tom Tidewood chucked it over the rail, another offering to the Drowned God.\n\u201cYour Drowned God is a demon,\u201d the black priest Moqorro said afterward. \u201cHe is no more than a thrall of the Other, the dark god whose name must not be spoken.\u201d\n\u201cTake care, priest,\u201d Victarion warned him. \u201cThere are godly men aboard this ship who would tear out your tongue for speaking such blasphemies. Your red god will have his due, I swear it. My word is iron. Ask any of my men.\u201d\nThe black priest bowed his head. \u201cThere is no need. The Lord of Light has shown me your worth, lord Captain. Every night in my fires I glimpse the glory that awaits you.\u201d\nThose words pleased Victarion Greyjoy mightily, as he told the dusky woman that night. \u201cMy brother Balon was a great man,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I shall do what he could not. The Iron Islands shall be free again, and the Old Way will return. Even Dagon could not do that.\u201d Almost a hundred years had passed since Dagon Greyjoy sat the Seastone Chair, but the ironborn still told tales of his raids and battles. In Dagon\u2019s day a weak king sat the Iron Throne, his rheumy eyes fixed across the narrow sea where bastards and exiles plotted rebellion. So forth from Pyke Lord Dagon sailed, to make the Sunset Sea his own. \u201cHe bearded the lion in his den and tied the direwolf\u2019s tail in knots, but even Dagon could not defeat the dragons. But I shall make the dragon queen mine own. She will share my bed and bear me many mighty sons.\u201d\nThat night the ships of the Iron Fleet numbered sixty.\nStrange sails grew more common north of Yaros. They were very near to Yunkai, and the coast between the Yellow City and Meereen would be teeming with merchantmen and supply ships coming and going, so Victarion took the Iron Fleet out into the deeper waters, beyond the sight of land. Even there they would encounter other vessels. \u201cLet none escape to give warning to our foes,\u201d the iron captain commanded. None did.\nThe sea was green and the sky was grey the morning Grief and Warrior Wench and Victarion\u2019s own Iron Victory captured the slaver galley from Yunkai in the waters due north of the Yellow City. In her holds were twenty perfumed boys and four score girls destined for the pleasure houses of Lys. Her crew never thought to find peril so close to their home waters, and the ironborn had little trouble taking her. She was named the Willing Maiden.\nVictarion put the slavers to the sword, then sent his men below to unchain the rowers. \u201cYou row for me now. Row hard, and you shall prosper.\u201d The girls he divided amongst his captains. \u201cThe Lyseni would have made whores of you,\u201d he told them, \u201cbut we have saved you. Now you need only serve one man instead of many. Those who please their captains may be taken as salt wives, an honorable station.\u201d The perfumed boys he wrapped in chains and threw into the sea. They were unnatural creatures, and the ship smelled better once cleansed of their presence.\nFor himself, Victarion claimed the seven choicest girls. One had red-gold hair and freckles on her teats. One shaved herself all over. One was brown-haired and brown-eyed, shy as a mouse. One had the biggest breasts he had ever seen. The fifth was a little thing, with straight black hair and golden skin. Her eyes were the color of amber. The sixth was white as milk, with golden rings through her nipples and her nether lips, the seventh black as a squid\u2019s ink. The slavers of Yunkai had trained them in the way of the seven sighs, but that was not why Victarion wanted them. His dusky woman was enough to satisfy his appetites until he could reach Meereen and claim his queen. No man had need of candles when the sun awaited him.\nThe galley he renamed the Slaver\u2019s Scream. With her, the ships of the Iron Fleet numbered one-and-sixty. \u201cEvery ship we capture makes us stronger,\u201d Victarion told his ironborn, \u201cbut from here it will grow harder. On the morrow or the day after, we are like to meet with warships. We are entering the home waters of Meereen, where the fleets of our foes await us. We will meet with ships from all three Slaver Cities, ships from Tolos and Elyria and New Ghis, even ships from Qarth.\u201d He took care not to mention the green galleys of Old Volantis that surely must be sailing up through the Gulf of Grief even as he spoke. \u201cThese slavers are feeble things. You have seen how they run before us, heard how they squeal when we put them to the sword. Every man of you is worth twenty of them, for only we are made of iron. Remember this when first we next spy some slaver\u2019s sails. Give no quarter and expect none. What need have we of quarter? We are the ironborn, and two gods look over us. We will seize their ships, smash their hopes, and turn their bay to blood.\u201d\nA great cry went up at his words. The captain answered with a nod, grim-faced, then called for the seven girls he had claimed to be brought on deck, the loveliest of all those found aboard the Willing Maiden. He kissed them each upon the cheeks and told them of the honor that awaited them, though they did not understand his words. Then he had them put aboard the fishing ketch that they had captured, cut her loose, and had her set afire.\n\u201cWith this gift of innocence and beauty, we honor both the gods,\u201d he proclaimed, as the warships of the Iron Fleet rowed past the burning ketch. \u201cLet these girls be reborn in light, undefiled by mortal lust, or let them descend to the Drowned God\u2019s watery halls, to feast and dance and laugh until the seas dry up.\u201d\nNear the end, before the smoking ketch was swallowed by the sea, the cries of the seven sweetlings changed to joyous song, it seemed to Victarion Greyjoy. A great wind came up then, a wind that filled their sails and swept them north and east and north again, toward Meereen and its pyramids of many-colored bricks. On wings of song I fly to you, Daenerys, the iron captain thought.\nThat night, for the first time, he brought forth the dragon horn that the Crow\u2019s Eye had found amongst the smoking wastes of great Valyria. A twisted thing it was, six feet long from end to end, gleaming black and banded with red gold and dark Valyrian steel. Euron\u2019s hellhorn. Victarion ran his hand along it. The horn was as warm and smooth as the dusky woman\u2019s thighs, and so shiny that he could see a twisted likeness of his own features in its depths. Strange sorcerous writings had been cut into the bands that girded it. \u201cValyrian glyphs,\u201d Moqorro called them.\nThat much Victarion had known. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d\n\u201cMuch and more.\u201d The black priest pointed to one golden band. \u201cHere the horn is named. \u2018I am Dragonbinder,\u2019 it says. Have you ever heard it sound?\u201d\n\u201cOnce.\u201d One of his brother\u2019s mongrels had sounded the hellhorn at the kingsmoot on Old Wyk. A monster of a man he had been, huge and shaven-headed, with rings of gold and jet and jade around arms thick with muscle, and a great hawk tattooed across his chest. \u201cThe sound it made\u00a0\u2026\u00a0it burned, somehow. As if my bones were on fire, searing my flesh from within. Those writings glowed red-hot, then white-hot and painful to look upon. It seemed as if the sound would never end. It was like some long scream. A thousand screams, all melted into one.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the man who blew the horn, what of him?\u201d\n\u201cHe died. There were blisters on his lips, after. His bird was bleeding too.\u201d The captain thumped his chest. \u201cThe hawk, just here. Every feather dripping blood. I heard the man was all burned up inside, but that might just have been some tale.\u201d\n\u201cA true tale.\u201d Moqorro turned the hellhorn, examining the queer letters that crawled across a second of the golden bands. \u201cHere it says, \u2018No mortal man shall sound me and live.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBitterly Victarion brooded on the treachery of brothers. Euron\u2019s gifts are always poisoned. \u201cThe Crow\u2019s Eye swore this horn would bind dragons to my will. But how will that serve me if the price is death?\u201d\n\u201cYour brother did not sound the horn himself. Nor must you.\u201d Moqorro pointed to the band of steel. \u201cHere. \u2018Blood for fire, fire for blood.\u2019 Who blows the hellhorn matters not. The dragons will come to the horn\u2019s master. You must claim the horn. With blood.\u201d",

      "content": "THE UGLY LITTLE GIRL\nEleven servants of the Many-Faced God gathered that night beneath the temple, more than she had ever seen together at one time. Only the lordling and the fat fellow arrived by the front door; the rest came by secret ways, through tunnels and hidden passages. They wore their robes of black and white, but as they took their seats each man pulled his cowl down to show the face he had chosen to wear that day. Their tall chairs were carved of ebony and weirwood, like the doors of the temple above. The ebon chairs had weirwood faces on their backs, the weirwood chairs faces of carved ebony.\nOne of the other acolytes stood across the room with a flagon of dark red wine. She had the water. Whenever one of the servants wished to drink, he would raise his eyes or crook a finger, and one or both of them would come and fill his cup. But mostly they stood, waiting on looks that never came. I am carved of stone, she reminded herself. I am a statue, like the Sealords that stand along the Canal of the Heroes. The water was heavy, but her arms were strong.\nThe priests used the language of Braavos, though once for several minutes three spoke heatedly in High Valyrian. The girl understood the words, mostly, but they spoke in soft voices, and she could not always hear. \u201cI know this man,\u201d she did hear a priest with the face of a plague victim say. \u201cI know this man,\u201d the fat fellow echoed, as she was pouring for him. But the handsome man said, \u201cI will give this man the gift, I know him not.\u201d Later the squinter said the same thing, of someone else.\nAfter three hours of wine and words, the priests took their leave\u00a0\u2026\u00a0all but the kindly man, the waif, and the one whose face bore the marks of plague. His cheeks were covered with weeping sores, and his hair had fallen out. Blood dripped from one nostril and crusted at the corners of both eyes. \u201cOur brother would have words with you, child,\u201d the kindly man told her. \u201cSit, if you wish.\u201d She seated herself in a weirwood chair with a face of ebony. Bloody sores held no terror for her. She had been too long in the House of Black and White to be afraid of a false face.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d plague face asked when they were alone.\n\u201cNo one.\u201d\n\u201cNot so. You are Arya of House Stark, who bites her lip and cannot tell a lie.\u201d\n\u201cI was. I\u2019m not now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you here, liar?\u201d\n\u201cTo serve. To learn. To change my face.\u201d\n\u201cFirst change your heart. The gift of the Many-Faced God is not a child\u2019s plaything. You would kill for your own purposes, for your own pleasures. Do you deny it?\u201d\nShe bit her lip. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nHe slapped her.\nThe blow left her cheek stinging, but she knew that she had earned it. \u201cThank you.\u201d Enough slaps, and she might stop chewing on her lip. Arya did that, not the night wolf. \u201cI do deny it.\u201d\n\u201cYou lie. I can see the truth in your eyes. You have the eyes of a wolf and a taste for blood.\u201d\nSer Gregor, she could not help but think. Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. If she spoke, she would need to lie, and he would know. She kept silent.\n\u201cYou were a cat, they tell me. Prowling through the alleys smelling of fish, selling cockles and mussels for coin. A small life, well suited for a small creature such as you. Ask, and it can be restored to you. Push your barrow, cry your cockles, be content. Your heart is too soft to be one of us.\u201d\nHe means to send me away. \u201cI have no heart. I only have a hole. I\u2019ve killed lots of people. I could kill you if I wanted.\u201d\n\u201cWould that taste sweet to you?\u201d\nShe did not know the right answer. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cThen you do not belong here. Death holds no sweetness in this house. We are not warriors, nor soldiers, nor swaggering bravos puffed up with pride. We do not kill to serve some lord, to fatten our purses, to stroke our vanity. We never give the gift to please ourselves. Nor do we choose the ones we kill. We are but servants of the God of Many Faces.\u201d\n\u201cValar dohaeris.\u201d All men must serve.\n\u201cYou know the words, but you are too proud to serve. A servant must be humble and obedient.\u201d\n\u201cI obey. I can be humbler than anyone.\u201d\nThat made him chuckle. \u201cYou will be the very goddess of humility, I am sure. But can you pay the price?\u201d\n\u201cWhat price?\u201d\n\u201cThe price is you. The price is all you have and all you ever hope to have. We took your eyes and gave them back. Next we will take your ears, and you will walk in silence. You will give us your legs and crawl. You will be no one\u2019s daughter, no one\u2019s wife, no one\u2019s mother. Your name will be a lie, and the very face you wear will not be your own.\u201d\nShe almost bit her lip again, but this time she caught herself and stopped. My face is a dark pool, hiding everything, showing nothing. She thought of all the names that she had worn: Arry, Weasel, Squab, Cat of the Canals. She thought of that stupid girl from Winterfell called Arya Horseface. Names did not matter. \u201cI can pay the price. Give me a face.\u201d\n\u201cFaces must be earned.\u201d\n\u201cTell me how.\u201d\n\u201cGive a certain man a certain gift. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat man?\u201d\n\u201cNo one that you know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a lot of people.\u201d\n\u201cHe is one of them. A stranger. No one you love, no one you hate, no one you have ever known. Will you kill him?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen on the morrow, you shall be Cat of the Canals again. Wear that face, watch, obey. And we will see if you are truly worthy to serve Him of Many Faces.\u201d\nSo the next day she returned to Brusco and his daughters in the house on the canal. Brusco\u2019s eyes widened when he saw her, and Brea gave a little gasp. \u201cValar morghulis,\u201d Cat said, by way of greeting. \u201cValar dohaeris,\u201d Brusco replied.\nAfter that it was as if she had never been away.\nShe got her first look at the man she must kill later that morning as she wheeled her barrow through the cobbled streets that fronted on the Purple Harbor. He was an old man, well past fifty. He has lived too long, she tried to tell herself. Why should he have so many years when my father had so few? But Cat of the Canals had no father, so she kept that thought to herself.\n\u201cCockles and mussels and clams,\u201d Cat cried as he went past, \u201coysters and prawns and fat green mussels.\u201d She even smiled at him. Sometimes a smile was all you needed to make them stop and buy. The old man did not smile back. He scowled at her and went on past, sloshing through a puddle. The splash wet her feet.\nHe has no courtesy, she thought, watching him go. His face is hard and mean. The old man\u2019s nose was pinched and sharp, his lips thin, his eyes small and close-set. His hair had gone to grey, but the little pointed beard at the end of his chin was still black. Cat thought it must be dyed and wondered why he had not dyed his hair as well. One of his shoulders was higher than the other, giving him a crooked cast.\n\u201cHe is an evil man,\u201d she announced that evening when she returned to the House of Black and White. \u201cHis lips are cruel, his eyes are mean, and he has a villain\u2019s beard.\u201d\nThe kindly man chuckled. \u201cHe is a man like any other, with light in him and darkness. It is not for you to judge him.\u201d\nThat gave her pause. \u201cHave the gods judged him?\u201d\n\u201cSome gods, mayhaps. What are gods for if not to sit in judgment over men? The Many-Faced God does not weigh men\u2019s souls, however. He gives his gift to the best of men as he gives it to the worst. Elsewise the good would live forever.\u201d\nThe old man\u2019s hands were the worst thing about him, Cat decided the next day, as she watched him from behind her barrow. His fingers were long and bony, always moving, scratching at his beard, tugging at an ear, drumming on a table, twitching, twitching, twitching. He has hands like two white spiders. The more she watched his hands, the more she came to hate them.\n\u201cHe moves his hands too much,\u201d she told them at the temple. \u201cHe must be full of fear. The gift will bring him peace.\u201d\n\u201cThe gift brings all men peace.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I kill him he will look in my eyes and thank me.\u201d\n\u201cIf he does, you will have failed. It would be best if he takes no note of you at all.\u201d\nThe old man was some sort of merchant, Cat concluded after watching him for a few days. His trade had to do with the sea, though she never saw him set foot upon a ship. He spent his days sitting in a soup shop near the Purple Harbor, a cup of onion broth cooling at his elbow as he shuffled papers and sealing wax and spoke in sharp tones to a parade of captains, shipowners, and other merchants, none of whom seemed to like him very much.\nYet they brought him money: leather purses plump with gold and silver and the square iron coins of Braavos. The old man would count it out carefully, sorting the coins and stacking them up neatly, like with like. He never looked at the coins. Instead he bit them, always on the left side of his mouth, where he still had all his teeth. From time to time he\u2019d spin one on the table and listen to the sound it made when it came clattering to a stop.\nAnd when all the coins had been counted and tasted, the old man would scrawl upon a parchment, stamp it with his seal, and give it to the captain. Else he\u2019d shake his head and shove the coins back across the table. Whenever he did that, the other man would get red-faced and angry, or pale and scared-looking.\nCat did not understand. \u201cThey pay him gold and silver, but he only gives them writing. Are they stupid?\u201d\n\u201cA few, mayhaps. Most are simply cautious. Some think to cozen him. He is not a man easily cozened, however.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is he selling them?\u201d\n\u201cHe is writing each a binder. If their ships are lost in a storm or taken by pirates, he promises to pay them for the value of the vessel and all its contents.\u201d\n\u201cIs it some kind of wager?\u201d\n\u201cOf a sort. A wager every captain hopes to lose.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but if they win\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0they lose their ships, oftimes their very lives. The seas are dangerous, and never more so than in autumn. No doubt many a captain sinking in a storm has taken some small solace in his binder back in Braavos, knowing that his widow and children will not want.\u201d A sad smile touched his lips. \u201cIt is one thing to write such a binder, though, and another to make good on it.\u201d\nCat understood. One of them must hate him. One of them came to the House of Black and White and prayed for the god to take him. She wondered who it had been, but the kindly man would not tell her. \u201cIt is not for you to pry into such matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d\n\u201cNo one asks no questions.\u201d He took her hands. \u201cIf you cannot do this thing, you need only say so. There is no shame in that. Some are made to serve the Many-Faced God and some are not. Say the word, and I shall lift this task from you.\u201d\n\u201cI will do it. I said I would. I will.\u201d\nHow, though? That was harder.\nHe had guards. Two of them, a tall thin man and a short thick one. They went with him everywhere, from when he left his house in the morning till he returned at night. They made certain no one got close to the old man without his leave. Once a drunk almost staggered into him as he was coming home from the soup shop, but the tall one stepped between them and gave the man a sharp shove that knocked him to the ground. At the soup shop, the short one always tasted the onion broth first. The old man waited until the broth had cooled before he took a sip, long enough to be sure his guardsman had suffered no ill effects.\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid,\u201d she realized, \u201cor else he knows that someone wants to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cHe does not know,\u201d said the kindly man, \u201cbut he suspects.\u201d\n\u201cThe guards go with him even when he slips out to make water,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t go when they do. The tall one is the quicker. I\u2019ll wait till he is making water, walk into the soup shop, and stab the old man through the eye.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other guard?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s slow and stupid. I can kill him too.\u201d\n\u201cAre you some butcher of the battlefield, hacking down every man who stands in your way?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI would hope not. You are a servant of the Many-Faced God, and we who serve Him of Many Faces give his gift only to those who have been marked and chosen.\u201d\nShe understood. Kill him. Kill only him.\nIt took her three more days of watching before she found the way, and another day of practicing with her finger knife. Red Roggo had taught her how to use it, but she had not slit a purse since back before they took away her eyes. She wanted to make certain that she still knew how. Smooth and quick, that\u2019s the way, no fumbling, she told herself, and she slipped the little blade out of her sleeve, again and again and again. When she was satisfied that she still remembered how to do it, she sharpened the steel on a whetstone until its edge glimmered silver-blue in the candlelight. The other part was trickier, but the waif was there to help her. \u201cI will give the man the gift on the morrow,\u201d she announced as she was breaking her fast.\n\u201cHim of Many Faces will be pleased.\u201d The kindly man rose. \u201cCat of the Canals is known to many. If she is seen to have done this deed, it might bring down trouble on Brusco and his daughters. It is time you had another face.\u201d\nThe girl did not smile, but inside she was pleased. She had lost Cat once, and mourned her. She did not want to lose her again. \u201cWhat will I look like?\u201d\n\u201cUgly. Women will look away when they see you. Children will stare and point. Strong men will pity you, and some may shed a tear. No one who sees you will soon forget you. Come.\u201d\nThe kindly man took the iron lantern off its hook and led her past the still black pool and the rows of dark and silent gods, to the steps at the rear of the temple. The waif fell in behind them as they were making their descent. No one spoke. The soft scuff of slippered feet on the steps was the only sound. Eighteen steps brought them to the vaults, where five arched passageways spread out like the fingers of a man\u2019s hand. Down here the steps grew narrower and steeper, but the girl had run up and down them a thousand times and they held no terrors for her. Twenty-two more steps and they were at the subcellar. The tunnels here were cramped and crooked, black wormholes twisting through the heart of the great rock. One passage was closed off by a heavy iron door. The priest hung the lantern from a hook, slipped a hand inside his robe, and produced an ornate key.\nGooseprickles rose along her arms. The sanctum. They were going lower still, down to the third level, to the secret chambers where only the priests were permitted.\nThe key clicked three times, very softly, as the kindly man turned it in a lock. The door swung open on oiled iron hinges, making not a sound. Beyond were still more steps, hewn out of solid rock. The priest took down the lantern once again and led the way. The girl followed the light, counting the steps as she went down. Four five six seven. She found herself wishing that she had brought her stick. Ten eleven twelve. She knew how many steps there were between the temple and the cellar, between the cellar and the subcellar, she had even counted the steps on the cramped winding stair that spiraled up into the garret and the rungs on the steep wooden ladder that ascended to the rooftop door and the windy perch outside.\nThis stair was unknown to her, however, and that made it perilous. One-and-twenty two-and-twenty three-and-twenty. With every step the air seemed to grow a little colder. When her count reached thirty she knew that they were under even the canals. Three-and-thirty four-and-thirty. How deep were they going to go?\nShe had reached fifty-four when the steps finally ended at another iron door. This one was unlocked. The kindly man pushed it open and stepped through. She followed, with the waif on her heels. Their footsteps echoed through the darkness. The kindly man lifted his lantern and flicked its shutters wide open. Light washed over the walls around them.\nA thousand faces were gazing down on her.\nThey hung upon the walls, before her and behind her, high and low, everywhere she looked, everywhere she turned. She saw old faces and young faces, pale faces and dark faces, smooth faces and wrinkled faces, freckled faces and scarred faces, handsome faces and homely faces, men and women, boys and girls, even babes, smiling faces, frowning faces, faces full of greed and rage and lust, bald faces and faces bristling with hair. Masks, she told herself, it\u2019s only masks, but even as she thought the thought, she knew it wasn\u2019t so. They were skins.\n\u201cDo they frighten you, child?\u201d asked the kindly man. \u201cIt is not too late for you to leave us. Is this truly what you want?\u201d\nArya bit her lip. She did not know what she wanted. If I leave, where will I go? She had washed and stripped a hundred corpses, dead things did not frighten her. They carry them down here and slice their faces off, so what? She was the night wolf, no scraps of skin could frighten her. Leather hoods, that\u2019s all they are, they cannot hurt me. \u201cDo it,\u201d she blurted out.\nHe led her across the chamber, past a row of tunnels leading off into side passages. The light of his lantern illuminated each in turn. One tunnel was walled with human bones, its roof supported by columns of skulls. Another opened on winding steps that descended farther still. How many cellars are there? she wondered. Do they just go down forever?\n\u201cSit,\u201d the priest commanded. She sat. \u201cNow close your eyes, child.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cThis will hurt,\u201d he warned her, \u201cbut pain is the price of power. Do not move.\u201d\nStill as stone, she thought. She sat unmoving. The cut was quick, the blade sharp. By rights the metal should have been cold against her flesh, but it felt warm instead. She could feel the blood washing down her face, a rippling red curtain falling across her brow and cheeks and chin, and she understood why the priest had made her close her eyes. When it reached her lips the taste was salt and copper. She licked at it and shivered.\n\u201cBring me the face,\u201d said the kindly man. The waif made no answer, but she could hear her slippers whispering over the stone floor. To the girl he said, \u201cDrink this,\u201d and pressed a cup into her hand. She drank it down at once. It was very tart, like biting into a lemon. A thousand years ago, she had known a girl who loved lemon cakes. No, that was not me, that was only Arya.\n\u201cMummers change their faces with artifice,\u201d the kindly man was saying, \u201cand sorcerers use glamors, weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye. These arts you shall learn, but what we do here goes deeper. Wise men can see through artifice, and glamors dissolve before sharp eyes, but the face you are about to don will be as true and solid as that face you were born with. Keep your eyes closed.\u201d She felt his fingers brushing back her hair. \u201cStay still. This will feel queer. You may be dizzy, but you must not move.\u201d\nThen came a tug and a soft rustling as the new face was pulled down over the old. The leather scraped across her brow, dry and stiff, but as her blood soaked into it, it softened and turned supple. Her cheeks grew warm, flushed. She could feel her heart fluttering beneath her breast, and for one long moment she could not catch her breath. Hands closed around her throat, hard as stone, choking her. Her own hands shot up to claw at the arms of her attacker, but there was no one there. A terrible sense of fear filled her, and she heard a noise, a hideous crunching noise, accompanied by blinding pain. A face floated in front of her, fat, bearded, brutal, his mouth twisted with rage. She heard the priest say, \u201cBreathe, child. Breathe out the fear. Shake off the shadows. He is dead. She is dead. Her pain is gone. Breathe.\u201d\nThe girl took a deep shuddering breath, and realized it was true. No one was choking her, no one was hitting her. Even so, her hand was shaking as she raised it to her face. Flakes of dried blood crumbled at the touch of her fingertips, black in the lantern light. She felt her cheeks, touched her eyes, traced the line of her jaw. \u201cMy face is still the same.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? Are you certain?\u201d\nWas she certain? She had not felt any change, but maybe it was not something you could feel. She swept a hand down across her face from top to bottom, as she had once seen Jaqen H\u2019ghar do, back at Harrenhal. When he did it, his whole face had rippled and changed. When she did it, nothing happened. \u201cIt feels the same.\u201d\n\u201cTo you,\u201d said the priest. \u201cIt does not look the same.\u201d\n\u201cTo other eyes, your nose and jaw are broken,\u201d said the waif. \u201cOne side of your face is caved in where your cheekbone shattered, and half your teeth are missing.\u201d\nShe probed around inside her mouth with her tongue, but found no holes or broken teeth. Sorcery, she thought. I have a new face. An ugly, broken face.\n\u201cYou may have bad dreams for a time,\u201d warned the kindly man. \u201cHer father beat her so often and so brutally that she was never truly free of pain or fear until she came to us.\u201d\n\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d\n\u201cShe asked the gift for herself, not for her father.\u201d\nYou should have killed him.\nHe must have read her thoughts. \u201cDeath came for him in the end, as it comes for all men. As it must come for a certain man upon the morrow.\u201d He lifted up the lamp. \u201cWe are done here.\u201d\nFor now. As they made their way back to the steps, the empty eyeholes of the skins upon the walls seemed to follow her. For a moment she could almost see their lips moving, whispering dark sweet secrets to one another in words too faint to hear.\nSleep did not come easily that night. Tangled in her blankets, she twisted this way and that in the cold dark room, but whichever way she turned, she saw the faces. They have no eyes, but they can see me. She saw her father\u2019s face upon the wall. Beside him hung her lady mother, and below them her three brothers all in a row. No. That was some other girl. I am no one, and my only brothers wear robes of black and white. Yet there was the black singer, there the stableboy she\u2019d killed with Needle, there the pimply squire from the crossroads inn, and over there the guard whose throat she\u2019d slashed to get them out of Harrenhal. The Tickler hung on the wall as well, the black holes that were his eyes swimming with malice. The sight of him brought back the feel of the dagger in her hand as she had plunged it into his back, again and again and again.\nWhen at last day came to Braavos, it came grey and dark and overcast. The girl had hoped for fog, but the gods ignored her prayers as gods so often did. The air was clear and cold, and the wind had a nasty bite to it. A good day for a death, she thought. Unbidden, her prayer came to her lips. Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. She mouthed the names silently. In the House of Black and White, you never knew who might be listening.\nThe vaults were full of old clothing, garments claimed from those who came to the House of Black and White to drink peace from the temple pool. Everything from beggar\u2019s rags to rich silks and velvets could be found there. An ugly girl should dress in ugly clothing, she decided, so she chose a stained brown cloak fraying at the hem, a musty green tunic smelling of fish, and a pair of heavy boots. Last of all she palmed her finger knife.\nThere was no haste, so she decided to take the long way round to the Purple Harbor. Across the bridge she went, to the Isle of the Gods. Cat of the Canals had sold cockles and mussels amongst the temples here, whenever Brusco\u2019s daughter Talea had her moon blood flowing and took to her bed. She half-expected to see Talea selling there today, perhaps outside the Warren where all the forgotten godlings had their forlorn little shrines, but that was silly. The day was too cold, and Talea never liked to wake this early. The statue outside the shrine of the Weeping Lady of Lys was crying silver tears as the ugly girl walked by. In the Gardens of Gelenei stood a gilded tree a hundred feet high with leaves of hammered silver. Torchlight glimmered behind windows of leaded glass in the Lord of Harmony\u2019s wooden hall, showing half a hundred kinds of butterflies in all their bright colors.\nOne time, the girl remembered, the Sailor\u2019s Wife had walked her rounds with her and told her tales of the city\u2019s stranger gods. \u201cThat is the house of the Great Shepherd. Three-headed Trios has that tower with three turrets. The first head devours the dying, and the reborn emerge from the third. I don\u2019t know what the middle head\u2019s supposed to do. Those are the Stones of the Silent God, and there the entrance to the Patternmaker\u2019s Maze. Only those who learn to walk it properly will ever find their way to wisdom, the priests of the Pattern say. Beyond it, by the canal, that\u2019s the temple of Aquan the Red Bull. Every thirteenth day, his priests slit the throat of a pure white calf, and offer bowls of blood to beggars.\u201d\nToday was not the thirteenth day, it seemed; the Red Bull\u2019s steps were empty. The brother gods Semosh and Selloso dreamed in twin temples on opposite sides of the Black Canal, linked by a carved stone bridge. The girl crossed there and made her way down to the docks, then through the Ragman\u2019s Harbor and past the half-sunken spires and domes of the Drowned Town.\nA group of Lysene sailors were staggering from the Happy Port as she went by, but the girl did not see any of the whores. The Ship was closed up and forlorn, its troupe of mummers no doubt still abed. But farther on, on the wharf beside an Ibbenese whaler, she spied Cat\u2019s old friend Tagganaro tossing a ball back and forth with Casso, King of Seals, whilst his latest cutpurse worked the crowd of onlookers. When she stopped to watch and listen for a moment, Tagganaro glanced at her without recognition, but Casso barked and clapped his flippers. He knows me, the girl thought, or else he smells the fish. She hurried on her way.\nBy the time she reached the Purple Harbor, the old man was ensconced inside the soup shop at his usual table, counting a purse of coins as he haggled with a ship\u2019s captain. The tall thin guard was hovering over him. The short thick one was seated near the door, where he would have a good view of anyone who entered. That made no matter. She did not intend to enter. Instead she perched atop a wooden piling twenty yards away as the blustery wind tugged at her cloak with ghostly fingers.\nEven on a cold grey day like this, the harbor was a busy place. She saw sailors on the prowl for whores, and whores on the prowl for sailors. A pair of bravos passed in rumpled finery, leaning on each other as they staggered drunkenly past the docks, their blades rattling at their sides. A red priest swept past, his scarlet and crimson robes snapping in the wind.\nIt was almost noon before she saw the man she wanted, a prosperous shipowner she had seen doing business with the old man three times before. Big and bald and burly, he wore a heavy cloak of plush brown velvet trimmed with fur and a brown leather belt ornamented with silver moons and stars. Some mishap had left one leg stiff. He walked slowly, leaning on a cane.\nHe would do as well as any and better than most, the ugly girl decided. She hopped off the piling and fell in after him. A dozen strides put her right behind him, her finger knife poised. His purse was on his right side, at his belt, but his cloak was in her way. Her blade flashed out, smooth and quick, one deep slash through the velvet and he never felt a thing. Red Roggo would have smiled to see it. She slipped her hand through the gap, slit the purse open with the finger knife, filled her fist with gold\u00a0\u2026\nThe big man turned. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nThe movement tangled her arm in the folds of his cloak as she was pulling out her hand. Coins rained around their feet. \u201cThief!\u201d The big man raised his stick to strike at her. She kicked his bad leg out from under him, danced away, and bolted as he fell, darting past a mother with a child. More coins fell from between her fingers to bounce along the ground. Shouts of \u201cthief, thief\u201d rang out behind her. A potbellied innkeep passing by made a clumsy grab for her arm, but she spun around him, flashed past a laughing whore, raced headlong for the nearest alley.\nCat of the Canals had known these alleys, and the ugly girl remembered. She darted left, vaulted a low wall, leapt across a small canal, and slipped through an unlocked door into some dusty storeroom. All sounds of pursuit had faded by then, but it was best to be sure. She hunkered down behind some crates and waited, arms wrapped around her knees. She waited for the best part of an hour, then decided it was safe to go, climbed straight up the side of the building, and made her way across the rooftops almost as far as the Canal of Heroes. By now the shipowner would have gathered up coins and cane and limped on to the soup shop. He might be drinking a bowl of hot broth and complaining to the old man about the ugly girl who had tried to rob his purse.\nThe kindly man was waiting for her at the House of Black and White, seated on the edge of the temple pool. The ugly girl sat next to him and put a coin on the lip of the pool between them. It was gold, with a dragon on one face and a king on the other.\n\u201cThe golden dragon of Westeros,\u201d said the kindly man. \u201cAnd how did you come by this? We are no thieves.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stealing. I took one of his, but I left him one of ours.\u201d\nThe kindly man understood. \u201cAnd with that coin and the others in his purse, he paid a certain man. Soon after that man\u2019s heart gave out. Is that the way of it? Very sad.\u201d The priest picked up the coin and tossed it into the pool. \u201cYou have much and more to learn, but it may be you are not hopeless.\u201d\nThat night they gave her back the face of Arya Stark.\nThey brought a robe for her as well, the soft thick robe of an acolyte, black upon one side and white upon the other. \u201cWear this when you are here,\u201d the priest said, \u201cbut know that you shall have little need of it for the present. On the morrow you will go to Izembaro to begin your first apprenticeship. Take what clothes you will from the vaults below. The city watch is looking for a certain ugly girl, known to frequent the Purple Harbor, so best you have a new face as well.\u201d He cupped her chin, turned her head this way and that, nodded. \u201cA pretty one this time, I think. As pretty as your own. Who are you, child?\u201d\n\u201cNo one,\u201d she replied.",

      "content": "CERSEI\nOn the last night of her imprisonment, the queen could not sleep. Each time she closed her eyes, her head filled with forebodings and fantasies of the morrow. I will have guards, she told herself. They will keep the crowds away. No one will be allowed to touch me. The High Sparrow had promised her that much.\nEven so, she was afraid. On the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne, the day of the bread riots, gold cloaks had been posted all along the route of the procession, but the mob had broken through their lines to tear the old fat High Septon into pieces and rape Lollys Stokeworth half a hundred times. And if that pale soft stupid creature could incite the animals when fully clothed, how much more lust would a queen inspire?\nCersei paced her cell, restless as the caged lions that had lived in the bowels of Casterly Rock when she was a girl, a legacy of her grandfather\u2019s time. She and Jaime used to dare each other to climb into their cage, and once she worked up enough courage to slip her hand between two bars and touch one of the great tawny beasts. She was always bolder than her brother. The lion had turned his head to stare at her with huge golden eyes. Then he licked her fingers. His tongue was as rough as a rasp, but even so she would not pull her hand back, not until Jaime took her by the shoulders and yanked her away from the cage.\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d she told him afterward. \u201cPull his mane, I dare you.\u201d He never did. I should have had the sword, not him.\nBarefoot and shivering she paced, a thin blanket draped about her shoulders. She was anxious for the day to come. By evening it would all be done. A little walk and I\u2019ll be home, I\u2019ll be back with Tommen, in my own chambers inside Maegor\u2019s Holdfast. Her uncle said it was the only way to save herself. Was it, though? She could not trust her uncle, no more than she trusted this High Septon. I could still refuse. I could still insist upon my innocence and hazard all upon a trial.\nBut she dare not let the Faith sit in judgment on her, as that Margaery Tyrell meant to do. That might serve the little rose well enough, but Cersei had few friends amongst the septas and sparrows around this new High Septon. Her only hope was trial by battle, and for that she must needs have a champion.\nIf Jaime had not lost his hand\u00a0\u2026\nThat road led nowhere, though. Jaime\u2019s sword hand was gone, and so was he, vanished with the woman Brienne somewhere in the riverlands. The queen had to find another defender or today\u2019s ordeal would be the least of her travails. Her enemies were accusing her of treason. She had to reach Tommen, no matter the costs. He loves me. He will not refuse his own mother. Joff was stubborn and unpredictable, but Tommen is a good little boy, a good little king. He will do as he is told. If she stayed here, she was doomed, and the only way she would return to the Red Keep was by walking. The High Sparrow had been adamant, and Ser Kevan refused to lift a finger against him.\n\u201cNo harm will come to me today,\u201d Cersei said when the day\u2019s first light brushed her window. \u201cOnly my pride will suffer.\u201d The words rang hollow in her ears. Jaime may yet come. She pictured him riding through the morning mists, his golden armor bright in the light of the rising sun. Jaime, if you ever loved me\u00a0\u2026\nWhen her gaolers came for her, Septa Unella, Septa Moelle, and Septa Scolera led the procession. With them were four novices and two of the silent sisters. The sight of the silent sisters in their grey robes filled the queen with sudden terrors. Why are they here? Am I to die? The silent sisters attended to the dead. \u201cThe High Septon promised that no harm would come to me.\u201d\n\u201cNor will it.\u201d Septa Unella beckoned to the novices. They brought lye soap, a basin of warm water, a pair of shears, and a long straightrazor. The sight of the steel sent a shiver through her. They mean to shave me. A little more humiliation, a raisin for my porridge. She would not give them the pleasure of hearing her beg. I am Cersei of House Lannister, a lion of the Rock, the rightful queen of these Seven Kingdoms, trueborn daughter of Tywin Lannister. And hair grows back. \u201cGet on with it,\u201d she said.\nThe elder of the two silent sisters took up the shears. A practiced barber, no doubt; her order often cleaned the corpses of the noble slain before returning them to their kin, and trimming beards and cutting hair was part of that. The woman bared the queen\u2019s head first. Cersei sat as still as a stone statue as the shears clicked. Drifts of golden hair fell to the floor. She had not been allowed to tend it properly penned up in this cell, but even unwashed and tangled it shone where the sun touched it. My crown, the queen thought. They took the other crown away from me, and now they are stealing this one as well. When her locks and curls were piled up around her feet, one of the novices soaped her head and the silent sister scraped away the stubble with a razor.\nCersei hoped that would be the end of it, but no. \u201cRemove your shift, Your Grace,\u201d Septa Unella commanded.\n\u201cHere?\u201d the queen asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou must be shorn.\u201d\nShorn, she thought, like a sheep. She yanked the shift over her head and tossed it to the floor. \u201cDo what you will.\u201d\nThen it was the soap again, the warm water, and the razor. The hair beneath her arms went next, then her legs, and last of all the fine golden down that covered her mound. When the silent sister crept between her legs with the razor, Cersei found herself remembering all the times that Jaime had knelt where she was kneeling now, planting kisses on the inside of her thighs, making her wet. His kisses were always warm. The razor was ice-cold.\nWhen the deed was done she was as naked and vulnerable as a woman could be. Not even a hair to hide behind. A little laugh burst from her lips, bleak and bitter.\n\u201cDoes Your Grace find this amusing?\u201d said Septa Scolera.\n\u201cNo, septa,\u201d said Cersei. But one day I will have your tongue ripped out with hot pincers, and that will be hilarious.\nOne of the novices had brought a robe for her, a soft white septa\u2019s robe to cover her as she made her way down the tower steps and through the sept, so any worshipers they met along the way might be spared the sight of naked flesh. Seven save us all, what hypocrites they are. \u201cWill I be permitted a pair of sandals?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe streets are filthy.\u201d\n\u201cNot so filthy as your sins,\u201d said Septa Moelle. \u201cHis High Holiness has commanded that you present yourself as the gods made you. Did you have sandals on your feet when you came forth from your lady mother\u2019s womb?\u201d\n\u201cNo, septa,\u201d the queen was forced to say.\n\u201cThen you have your answer.\u201d\nA bell began to toll. The queen\u2019s long imprisonment was at an end. Cersei pulled the robe tighter, grateful for its warmth, and said, \u201cLet us go.\u201d Her son awaited her across the city. The sooner she set out, the sooner she would see him.\nThe rough stone of the steps scraped her soles as Cersei Lannister made her descent. She had come to Baelor\u2019s Sept a queen, riding in a litter. She was leaving bald and barefoot. But I am leaving. That is all that matters.\nThe tower bells were singing, summoning the city to bear witness to her shame. The Great Sept of Baelor was crowded with faithful come for the dawn service, the sound of their prayers echoing off the dome overhead, but when the queen\u2019s procession made its appearance a sudden silence fell and a thousand eyes turned to follow her as she made her way down the aisle, past the place where her lord father had lain in state after his murder. Cersei swept by them, looking neither right nor left. Her bare feet slapped against the cold marble floor. She could feel the eyes. Behind their altars, the Seven seemed to watch as well.\nIn the Hall of Lamps, a dozen Warrior\u2019s Sons awaited her coming. Rainbow cloaks hung down their backs, and the crystals that crested their greathelms glittered in the lamplight. Their armor was silver plate polished to a mirror sheen, but underneath, she knew, every man of them wore a hair shirt. Their kite shields all bore the same device: a crystal sword shining in the darkness, the ancient badge of those the smallfolk called Swords.\nTheir captain knelt before her. \u201cPerhaps Your Grace will recall me. I am Ser Theodan the True, and His High Holiness has given me command of your escort. My brothers and I will see you safely through the city.\u201d\nCersei\u2019s gaze swept across the faces of the men behind him. And there he was: Lancel, her cousin, Ser Kevan\u2019s son, who had once professed to love her, before he decided that he loved the gods more. My blood and my betrayer. She would not forget him. \u201cYou may rise, Ser Theodan. I am ready.\u201d\nThe knight stood, turned, raised a hand. Two of his men stepped to the towering doors and pushed them open, and Cersei walked through them into the open air, blinking at the sunlight like a mole roused from its burrow.\nA gusty wind was blowing, and it set the bottom of her robe snapping and flapping at her legs. The morning air was thick with the old familiar stinks of King\u2019s Landing. She breathed in the scents of sour wine, bread baking, rotting fish and nightsoil, smoke and sweat and horse piss. No flower had ever smelled so sweet. Huddled in her robe, Cersei paused atop the marble steps as the Warrior\u2019s Sons formed up around her.\nIt came to her suddenly that she had stood in this very spot before, on the day Lord Eddard Stark had lost his head. That was not supposed to happen. Joff was supposed to spare his life and send him to the Wall. Stark\u2019s eldest son would have followed him as Lord of Winterfell, but Sansa would have stayed at court, a hostage. Varys and Littlefinger had worked out the terms, and Ned Stark had swallowed his precious honor and confessed his treason to save his daughter\u2019s empty little head. I would have made Sansa a good marriage. A Lannister marriage. Not Joff, of course, but Lancel might have suited, or one of his younger brothers. Petyr Baelish had offered to wed the girl himself, she recalled, but of course that was impossible; he was much too lowborn. If Joff had only done as he was told, Winterfell would never have gone to war, and Father would have dealt with Robert\u2019s brothers.\nInstead Joff had commanded that Stark\u2019s head be struck off, and Lord Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne had hastened to obey. It was just there, the queen recalled, gazing at the spot. Janos Slynt had lifted Ned Stark\u2019s head by the hair as his life\u2019s blood flowed down the steps, and after that there was no turning back.\nThe memories seemed so distant. Joffrey was dead, and all Stark\u2019s sons as well. Even her father had perished. And here she stood on the steps of the Great Sept again, only this time it was her the mob was staring at, not Eddard Stark.\nThe wide marble plaza below was as crowded as it had been on the day that Stark had died. Everywhere she looked the queen saw eyes. The mob seemed to be equal parts men and women. Some had children on their shoulders. Beggars and thieves, taverners and tradesfolk, tanners and stableboys and mummers, the poorer sort of whore, all the scum had come out to see a queen brought low. And mingled in with them were the Poor Fellows, filthy, unshaven creatures armed with spears and axes and clad in bits of dinted plate, rusted mail, and cracked leather, under roughspun surcoats bleached white and blazoned with the seven-pointed star of the Faith. The High Sparrow\u2019s ragged army.\nPart of her still yearned for Jaime to appear and rescue her from this humiliation, but her twin was nowhere to be seen. Nor was her uncle present. That did not surprise her. Ser Kevan had made his views plain during his last visit; her shame must not be allowed to tarnish the honor of Casterly Rock. No lions would walk with her today. This ordeal was hers and hers alone.\nSepta Unella stood to her right, Septa Moelle to her left, Septa Scolera behind her. If the queen should bolt or balk, the three hags would drag her back inside, and this time they would see to it that she never left her cell.\nCersei raised her head. Beyond the plaza, beyond the sea of hungry eyes and gaping mouths and dirty faces, across the city, Aegon\u2019s High Hill rose in the distance, the towers and battlements of the Red Keep blushing pink in the light of the rising sun. It is not so far. Once she reached its gates, the worst of her travails would be over. She would have her son again. She would have her champion. Her uncle had promised her. Tommen is waiting for me. My little king. I can do this. I must.\nSepta Unella stepped forward. \u201cA sinner comes before you,\u201d she declared. \u201cShe is Cersei of House Lannister, queen dowager, mother to His Grace King Tommen, widow of His Grace King Robert, and she has committed grievous falsehoods and fornications.\u201d\nSepta Moelle moved up on the queen\u2019s right. \u201cThis sinner has confessed her sins and begged for absolution and forgiveness. His High Holiness has commanded her to demonstrate her repentance by putting aside all pride and artifice and presenting herself as the gods made her before the good people of the city.\u201d\nSepta Scolera finished. \u201cSo now this sinner comes before you with a humble heart, shorn of secrets and concealments, naked before the eyes of gods and men, to make her walk of atonement.\u201d\nCersei had been a year old when her grandfather died. The first thing her father had done on his ascension was to expel his own father\u2019s grasping, lowborn mistress from Casterly Rock. The silks and velvets Lord Tytos had lavished on her and the jewelry she had taken for herself had been stripped from her, and she had been sent forth naked to walk through the streets of Lannisport, so the west could see her for what she was.\nThough she had been too young to witness the spectacle herself, Cersei had heard the stories growing up from the mouths of washerwomen and guardsmen who had been there. They spoke of how the woman had wept and begged, of the desperate way she clung to her garments when she was commanded to disrobe, of her futile efforts to cover her breasts and her sex with her hands as she hobbled barefoot and naked through the streets to exile. \u201cVain and proud she was, before,\u201d she remembered one guard saying, \u201cso haughty you\u2019d think she\u2019d forgot she come from dirt. Once we got her clothes off her, though, she was just another whore.\u201d\nIf Ser Kevan and the High Sparrow thought that it would be the same with her, they were very much mistaken. Lord Tywin\u2019s blood was in her. I am a lioness. I will not cringe for them.\nThe queen shrugged off her robe.\nShe bared herself in one smooth, unhurried motion, as if she were back in her own chambers disrobing for her bath with no one but her bedmaids looking on. When the cold wind touched her skin, she shivered violently. It took all her strength of will not to try and hide herself with her hands, as her grandfather\u2019s whore had done. Her fingers tightened into fists, her nails digging into her palms. They were looking at her, all the hungry eyes. But what were they seeing? I am beautiful, she reminded himself. How many times had Jaime told her that? Even Robert had given her that much, when he came to her bed in his cups to pay her drunken homage with his cock.\nThey looked at Ned Stark the same way, though.\nShe had to move. Naked, shorn, barefoot, Cersei made a slow descent down the broad marble steps. Gooseprickles rose on her arms and legs. She held her chin high, as a queen should, and her escort fanned out ahead of her. The Poor Fellows shoved men aside to open a way through the crowd whilst the Swords fell in on either side of her. Septa Unella, Septa Scolera, and Septa Moelle followed. Behind them came the novice girls in white.\n\u201cWhore!\u201d someone cried out. A woman\u2019s voice. Women were always the cruelest where other women were concerned.\nCersei ignored her. There will be more, and worse. These creatures have no sweeter joy in life than jeering at their betters. She could not silence them, so she must pretend she did not hear them. She would not see them either. She would keep her eyes on Aegon\u2019s High Hill across the city, on the towers of the Red Keep shimmering in the light. That was where she would find her salvation, if her uncle had kept his part of their bargain.\nHe wanted this. Him and the High Sparrow. And the little rose as well, I do not doubt. I have sinned and must atone, must parade my shame before the eyes of every beggar in the city. They think that this will break my pride, that it will make an end to me, but they are wrong.\nSepta Unella and Septa Moelle kept pace with her, with Septa Scolera scurrying behind, ringing a bell. \u201cShame,\u201d the old hag called, \u201cshame upon the sinner, shame, shame.\u201d Somewhere off to the right, another voice sang counterpoint to hers, some baker\u2019s boy shouting, \u201cMeat pies, three pence, hot meat pies here.\u201d The marble underfoot was cold and slick, and Cersei had to step carefully for fear of slipping. Their path took them past the statue of Baelor the Blessed, standing tall and serene upon his plinth, his face a study in benevolence. To look at him, you would never guess what a fool he\u2019d been. The Targaryen dynasty had produced kings both bad and good, but none as beloved as Baelor, that pious gentle septon-king who loved the smallfolk and the gods in equal parts, yet imprisoned his own sisters. It was a wonder that his statue did not crumble at the sight of her bare breasts. Tyrion used to say that King Baelor was terrified of his own cock. Once, she recalled, he had expelled all the whores from King\u2019s Landing. He prayed for them as they were driven from the city gates, the histories said, but would not look at them.\n\u201cHarlot,\u201d a voice screamed. Another woman. Something flew out of the crowd. Some rotted vegetable. Brown and oozing, it sailed above her head to splash at the foot of one of the Poor Fellows. I am not afraid. I am a lioness. She walked on. \u201cHot pies,\u201d the baker\u2019s boy was crying. \u201cGetcha hot pies here.\u201d Septa Scolera rang her bell, singing, \u201cShame, shame, shame upon the sinner, shame, shame.\u201d The Poor Fellows went before them, forcing men aside with their shields, walling off a narrow path. Cersei followed where they led, her head held stiffly, her eyes on the far distance. Every step brought the Red Keep nearer. Every step brought her closer to her son and her salvation.\nIt seemed to take a hundred years to cross the plaza, but finally marble gave way to cobblestones beneath her feet, shops and stables and houses closed in all around them, and they began the descent of Visenya\u2019s Hill.\nThe going was slower here. The street was steep and narrow, the crowds jammed together tightly. The Poor Fellows shoved at those who blocked the way, trying to move them aside, but there was nowhere to go, and those in the back of the crowd were shoving back. Cersei tried to keep her head up, only to step in something slick and wet that made her slip. She might have fallen, but Septa Unella caught her arm and kept her on her feet. \u201cYour Grace should watch where she sets her feet.\u201d\nCersei wrenched herself free. \u201cYes, septa,\u201d she said in a meek voice, though she was angry enough to spit. The queen walked on, clad only in gooseprickles and pride. She looked for the Red Keep, but it was hidden now, walled off from her gaze by the tall timbered buildings to either side. \u201cShame, shame,\u201d sang Septa Scolera, her bell clanging. Cersei tried to walk faster, but soon came up against the backs of the Stars in front of her and had to slow her steps again. A man just ahead was selling skewers of roast meat from a cart, and the procession halted as the Poor Fellows moved him out of the way. The meat looked suspiciously like rat to Cersei\u2019s eyes, but the smell of it filled the air, and half the men around them were gnawing away with sticks in hand by the time the street was clear enough for her to resume her trek. \u201cWant some, Your Grace?\u201d one man called out. He was a big, burly brute with pig eyes, a massive gut, and an unkempt black beard that reminded her of Robert. When she looked away in disgust, he flung the skewer at her. It struck her on the leg and tumbled to the street, and the half-cooked meat left a smear of grease and blood down her thigh.\nThe shouting seemed louder here than on the plaza, perhaps because the mob was so much closer. \u201cWhore\u201d and \u201csinner\u201d were most common, but \u201cbrotherfucker\u201d and \u201ccunt\u201d and \u201ctraitor\u201d were flung at her as well, and now and again she heard someone shout out for Stannis or Margaery. The cobbles underfoot were filthy, and there was so little space that the queen could not even walk around the puddles. No one has ever died of wet feet, she told herself. She wanted to believe the puddles were just rainwater, though horse piss was just as likely.\nMore refuse showered down from windows and balconies: half-rotted fruit, pails of beer, eggs that exploded into sulfurous stink when they cracked open on the ground. Then someone flung a dead cat over the Poor Fellows and Warrior\u2019s Sons alike. The carcass hit the cobbles so hard that it burst open, spattering her lower legs with entrails and maggots.\nCersei walked on. I am blind and deaf, and they are worms, she told herself. \u201cShame, shame,\u201d the septas sang. \u201cChestnuts, hot roast chestnuts,\u201d a peddler cried. \u201cQueen Cunt,\u201d a drunkard pronounced solemnly from a balcony above, lifting his cup to her in a mocking toast. \u201cAll hail the royal teats!\u201d Words are wind, Cersei thought. Words cannot harm me.\nHalfway down Visenya\u2019s Hill the queen fell for the first time, when her foot slipped in something that might have been nightsoil. When Septa Unella pulled her up, her knee was scraped and bloody. A ragged laugh rippled through the crowd, and some man shouted out an offer to kiss it and make it better. Cersei looked behind her. She could still see the great dome and seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor atop the hill. Have I really come such a little way? Worse, a hundred times worse, she had lost sight of the Red Keep. \u201cWhere\u00a0\u2026\u00a0where \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d The captain of her escort stepped up beside her. Cersei had forgotten his name. \u201cYou must continue. The crowd is growing unruly.\u201d\nYes, she thought. Unruly. \u201cI am not afraid\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou should be.\u201d He yanked at her arm, pulling her along beside him. She staggered down the hill\u2014downward, ever downward\u2014wincing with every step, letting him support her. It should be Jaime beside me. He would draw his golden sword and slash a path right through the mob, carving the eyes out of the head of every man who dared to look at her.\nThe paving stones were cracked and uneven, slippery underfoot, and rough against her soft feet. Her heel came down on something sharp, a stone or piece of broken crockery. Cersei cried out in pain. \u201cI asked for sandals,\u201d she spat at Septa Unella. \u201cYou could have given me sandals, you could have done that much.\u201d The knight wrenched at her arm again, as if she were some common serving wench. Has he forgotten who I am? She was the queen of Westeros; he had no right to lay rough hands on her.\nNear the bottom of the hill, the slope gentled and the street began to widen. Cersei could see the Red Keep again, shining crimson in the morning sun atop Aegon\u2019s High Hill. I must keep walking. She wrenched free of Ser Theodan\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou do not need to drag me, ser.\u201d She limped on, leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the stones behind her.\nShe walked through mud and dung, bleeding, goosefleshed, hobbling. All around her was a babble of sound. \u201cMy wife has sweeter teats than those,\u201d a man shouted. A teamster cursed as the Poor Fellows ordered his wagon out of the way. \u201cShame, shame, shame on the sinner,\u201d chanted the septas. \u201cLook at this one,\u201d a whore called from a brothel window, lifting her skirts to the men below, \u201cit\u2019s not had half as many cocks up it as hers.\u201d Bells were ringing, ringing, ringing. \u201cThat can\u2019t be the queen,\u201d a boy said, \u201cshe\u2019s saggy as my mum.\u201d This is my penance, Cersei told herself. I have sinned most grievously, this is my atonement. It will be over soon, it will be behind me, then I can forget.\nThe queen began to see familiar faces. A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father\u2019s frown, and for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin that she stumbled. A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with Melara Hetherspoon\u2019s accusing eyes. She saw Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf. Every child squirming through the crowd became her brother Tyrion, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died. And there was Joff as well, her son, her firstborn, her beautiful bright boy with his golden curls and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he\u00a0\u2026\nThat was when she fell the second time.\nShe was shaking like a leaf when they pulled her to her feet. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cMother have mercy. I confessed.\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said Septa Moelle. \u201cThis is your atonement.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not much farther,\u201d said Septa Unella. \u201cSee?\u201d She pointed. \u201cUp the hill, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nUp the hill. That\u2019s all. It was true. They were at the foot of Aegon\u2019s High Hill, the castle above them.\n\u201cWhore,\u201d someone screamed.\n\u201cBrotherfucker,\u201d another voice added. \u201cAbomination.\u201d\n\u201cWant a suck on this, Your Grace?\u201d A man in a butcher\u2019s apron pulled his cock out of his breeches, grinning. It did not matter. She was almost home.\nCersei began to climb.\nIf anything, the jeers and shouts were cruder here. Her walk had not taken her through Flea Bottom, so its denizens had packed onto the lower slopes of Aegon\u2019s High Hill to see the show. The faces leering out at her from behind the shields and spears of the Poor Fellows seemed twisted, monstrous, hideous. Pigs and naked children were everywhere underfoot, crippled beggars and cutpurses swarmed like roaches through the press. She saw men whose teeth had been filed into points, hags with goiters as big as their heads, a whore with a huge striped snake draped about breasts and shoulders, a man whose cheeks and brow were covered with open sores that wept grey pus. They grinned and licked their lips and hooted at her as she went limping past, her breasts heaving with the effort of the climb. Some shouted obscene proposals, others insults. Words are wind, she thought, words cannot hurt me. I am beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all Westeros, Jaime says so, Jaime would never lie to me. Even Robert, Robert never loved me, but he saw that I was beautiful, he wanted me.\nShe did not feel beautiful, though. She felt old, used, filthy, ugly. There were stretch marks on her belly from the children she had borne, and her breasts were not as firm as they had been when she was younger. Without a gown to hold them up, they sagged against her chest. I should not have done this. I was their queen, but now they\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve seen. I should never have let them see. Gowned and crowned, she was a queen. Naked, bloody, limping, she was only a woman, not so very different from their wives, more like their mothers than their pretty little maiden daughters. What have I done?\nThere was something in her eyes, stinging, blurring her sight. She could not cry, she would not cry, the worms must never see her weep. Cersei rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. A gust of cold wind made her shiver violently.\nAnd suddenly the hag was there, standing in the crowd with her pendulous teats and her warty greenish skin, leering with the rest, with malice shining from her crusty yellow eyes. \u201cQueen you shall be,\u201d she hissed, \u201cuntil there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold most dear.\u201d\nAnd then there was no stopping the tears. They burned down the queen\u2019s cheeks like acid. Cersei gave a sharp cry, covered her nipples with one arm, slid her other hand down to hide her slit, and began to run, shoving her way past the line of Poor Fellows, crouching as she scrambled crab-legged up the hill. Partway up she stumbled and fell, rose, then fell again ten yards farther on. The next thing she knew she was crawling, scrambling uphill on all fours like a dog as the good folks of King\u2019s Landing made way for her, laughing and jeering and applauding her.\nThen all at once the crowd parted and seemed to dissolve, and there were the castle gates before her, and a line of spearmen in gilded halfhelms and crimson cloaks. Cersei heard the gruff, familiar sound of her uncle growling orders and glimpsed a flash of white to either side as Ser Boros Blount and Ser Meryn Trant strode toward her in their pale plate and snowy cloaks. \u201cMy son,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhere is my son? Where is Tommen?\u201d\n\u201cNot here. No son should have to bear witness to his mother\u2019s shame.\u201d Ser Kevan\u2019s voice was harsh. \u201cCover her up.\u201d\nThen Jocelyn was bending over her, wrapping her in a soft clean blanket of green wool to cover her nakedness. A shadow fell across them both, blotting out the sun. The queen felt cold steel slide beneath her, a pair of great armored arms lifting her off the ground, lifting her up into the air as easily as she had lifted Joffrey when he was still a babe. A giant, thought Cersei, dizzy, as he carried her with great strides toward the gatehouse. She had heard that giants could still be found in the godless wild beyond the Wall. That is just a tale. Am I dreaming?\nNo. Her savior was real. Eight feet tall or maybe taller, with legs as thick around as trees, he had a chest worthy of a plow horse and shoulders that would not disgrace an ox. His armor was plate steel, enameled white and bright as a maiden\u2019s hopes, and worn over gilded mail. A greathelm hid his face. From its crest streamed seven silken plumes in the rainbow colors of the Faith. A pair of golden seven-pointed stars clasped his billowing cloak at the shoulders.\nA white cloak.\nSer Kevan had kept his part of the bargain. Tommen, her precious little boy, had named her champion to the Kingsguard.\nCersei never saw where Qyburn came from, but suddenly he was there beside them, scrambling to keep up with her champion\u2019s long strides. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cit is so good to have you back. May I have the honor of presenting our newest member of the Kingsguard? This is Ser Robert Strong.\u201d\n\u201cSer Robert,\u201d Cersei whispered, as they entered the gates.\n\u201cIf it please Your Grace, Ser Robert has taken a holy vow of silence,\u201d Qyburn said. \u201cHe has sworn that he will not speak until all of His Grace\u2019s enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm.\u201d\nYes, thought Cersei Lannister. Oh, yes.",

      "content": "TYRION\nThe pile of parchments was formidably high. Tyrion looked at it and sighed. \u201cI had understood you were a band of brothers. Is this the love a brother bears a brother? Where is the trust? The friendship, the fond regard, the deep affection that only men who have fought and bled together can ever know?\u201d\n\u201cAll in time,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm.\n\u201cAfter you sign,\u201d said Inkpots, sharpening a quill.\nKasporio the Cunning touched his sword hilt. \u201cIf you would like to start the bleeding now, I will happ\u2019ly oblige you.\u201d\n\u201cHow kind of you to offer,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cI think not.\u201d\nInkpots placed the parchments before Tyrion and handed him the quill. \u201cHere is your ink. From Old Volantis, this. \u2019Twill last as long as proper maester\u2019s black. All you need do is sign and pass the notes to me. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d\nTyrion gave him a crooked grin. \u201cMight I read them first?\u201d\n\u201cIf you like. They are all the same, by and large. Except for the ones at the bottom, but we\u2019ll get to those in due course.\u201d\nOh, I am sure we will. For most men, there was no cost to joining a company, but he was not most men. He dipped the quill into the inkpot, leaned over the first parchment, paused, looked up. \u201cWould you prefer me to sign Yollo or Hugor Hill?\u201d\nBrown Ben crinkled up his eyes. \u201cWould you prefer to be returned to Yezzan\u2019s heirs or just beheaded?\u201d\nThe dwarf laughed and signed the parchment, Tyrion of House Lannister. As he passed it left to Inkpots, he riffled through the pile underneath. \u201cThere are\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what, fifty? Sixty? I\u2019d thought there were five hundred Second Sons.\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred thirteen at present,\u201d Inkpots said. \u201cWhen you sign our book, we will be five hundred fourteen.\u201d\n\u201cSo only one in ten receives a note? That hardly seems fair. I thought you were all share-and-share-alike in the free companies.\u201d He signed another sheet.\nBrown Ben chuckled. \u201cOh, all share. But not alike. The Second Sons are not unlike a family\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0and every family has its drooling cousins.\u201d Tyrion signed another note. The parchment crinkled crisply as he slid it toward the paymaster. \u201cThere are cells down in the bowels of Casterly Rock where my lord father kept the worst of ours.\u201d He dipped his quill in the inkpot. Tyrion of House Lannister, he scratched out, promising to pay the bearer of the note one hundred golden dragons. Every stroke of the quill leaves me a little poorer\u00a0\u2026\u00a0or would, if I were not a beggar to begin with. One day he might rue these signatures. But not this day. He blew on the wet ink, slid the parchment to the paymaster, and signed the one beneath. And again. And again. And again. \u201cThis wounds me deeply, I will have you know,\u201d he told them between signatures. \u201cIn Westeros, the word of a Lannister is considered good as gold.\u201d\nInkpots shrugged. \u201cThis is not Westeros. On this side of the narrow sea, we put our promises on paper.\u201d As each sheet was passed to him, he scattered fine sand across the signature to drink up excess ink, shook it off, and set the note aside. \u201cDebts written on the wind tend to be\u00a0\u2026\u00a0forgotten, shall we say?\u201d\n\u201cNot by us.\u201d Tyrion signed another sheet. And another. He had found a rhythm now. \u201cA Lannister always pays his debts.\u201d\nPlumm chuckled. \u201cAye, but a sellsword\u2019s word is worthless.\u201d\nWell, yours is, thought Tyrion, and thank the gods for that. \u201cTrue, but I will not be a sellsword until I\u2019ve signed your book.\u201d\n\u201cSoon enough,\u201d said Brown Ben. \u201cAfter the notes.\u201d\n\u201cI am dancing as fast as I can.\u201d He wanted to laugh, but that would have ruined the game. Plumm was enjoying this, and Tyrion had no intention of spoiling his fun. Let him go on thinking that he\u2019s bent me over and fucked me up the arse, and I\u2019ll go on buying steel swords with parchment dragons. If ever he went back to Westeros to claim his birthright, he would have all the gold of Casterly Rock to make good on his promises. If not, well, he\u2019d be dead, and his new brothers could wipe their arses with these parchments. Perhaps some might turn up in King\u2019s Landing with their scraps in hand, hoping to convince his sweet sister to make good on them. And would that I could be a roach in the rushes to witness that.\nThe writing on the parchments changed about halfway down the pile. The hundred-dragon notes were all for serjeants. Below them the amounts suddenly grew larger. Now Tyrion was promising to pay the bearer one thousand golden dragons. He shook his head, laughed, signed. And again. And again. \u201cSo,\u201d he said as he was scrawling, \u201cwhat will be my duties with the company?\u201d\n\u201cYou are too ugly to be Bokkoko\u2019s butt boy,\u201d said Kasporio, \u201cbut you might do as arrow fodder.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than you know,\u201d said Tyrion, refusing to rise to the bait. \u201cA small man with a big shield will drive the archers mad. A wiser man than you once told me that.\u201d\n\u201cYou will work with Inkpots,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm.\n\u201cYou will work for Inkpots,\u201d said Inkpots. \u201cKeeping books, counting coin, writing contracts and letters.\u201d\n\u201cGladly,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cI love books.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else would you do?\u201d sneered Kasporio. \u201cLook at you. You are not fit to fight.\u201d\n\u201cI once had charge of all the drains in Casterly Rock,\u201d Tyrion said mildly. \u201cSome of them had been stopped up for years, but I soon had them draining merrily away.\u201d He dipped the quill in the ink again. Another dozen notes, and he would be done. \u201cPerhaps I could supervise your camp followers. We can\u2019t have the men stopped up, now can we?\u201d\nThat jape did not please Brown Ben. \u201cStay away from the whores,\u201d he warned. \u201cMost o\u2019 them are poxy, and they talk. You\u2019re not the first escaped slave to join the company, but that don\u2019t mean we need to shout your presence. I won\u2019t have you parading about where you might be seen. Stay inside as much as you can, and shit into your bucket. Too many eyes at the latrines. And never go beyond our camp without my leave. We can dress you up in squire\u2019s steel, pretend you\u2019re Jorah\u2019s butt boy, but there\u2019s some will see right through that. Once Meereen is taken and we\u2019re away to Westeros, you can prance about all you like in gold and crimson. Till then, though\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0I shall live beneath a rock and never make a sound. You have my word on that.\u201d Tyrion of House Lannister, he signed once more, with a flourish. That was the last parchment. Three notes remained, different from the rest. Two were written on fine vellum and made out by name. For Kasporio the Cunning, ten thousand dragons. The same for Inkpots, whose true name appeared to be Tybero Istarion. \u201cTybero?\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThat sounds almost Lannister. Are you some long-lost cousin?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. I always pay my debts as well. It is expected of a paymaster. Sign.\u201d\nHe signed.\nBrown Ben\u2019s note was the last. That one had been inscribed upon a sheepskin scroll. One hundred thousand golden dragons, fifty hides of fertile land, a castle, and a lordship. Well and well. This Plumm does not come cheaply. Tyrion plucked at his scar and wondered if he ought to make a show of indignation. When you bugger a man you expect a squeal or two. He could curse and swear and rant of robbery, refuse to sign for a time, then give in reluctantly, protesting all the while. But he was sick of mummery, so instead he grimaced, signed, and handed the scroll back to Brown Ben. \u201cYour cock is as big as in the stories,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider me well and truly fucked, Lord Plumm.\u201d\nBrown Ben blew on his signature. \u201cMy pleasure, Imp. And now, we make you one o\u2019 us. Inkpots, fetch the book.\u201d\nThe book was leather-bound with iron hinges, and large enough to eat your supper off. Inside its heavy wooden boards were names and dates going back more than a century. \u201cThe Second Sons are amongst the oldest of the free companies,\u201d Inkpots said as he was turning pages. \u201cThis is the fourth book. The names of every man to serve with us are written here. When they joined, where they fought, how long they served, the manner of their deaths\u2014all in the book. You will find famous names in here, some from your Seven Kingdoms. Aegor Rivers served a year with us, before he left to found the Golden Company. Bittersteel, you call him. The Bright Prince, Aerion Targaryen, he was a Second Son. And Rodrik Stark, the Wandering Wolf, him as well. No, not that ink. Here, use this.\u201d He unstoppered a new pot and set it down.\nTyrion cocked his head. \u201cRed ink?\u201d\n\u201cA tradition of the company,\u201d Inkpots explained. \u201cThere was a time when each new man wrote his name in his own blood, but as it happens, blood makes piss-poor ink.\u201d\n\u201cLannisters love tradition. Lend me your knife.\u201d\nInkpots raised an eyebrow, shrugged, slipped his dagger from its sheath, and handed it across hiltfirst. It still hurts, Halfmaester, thank you very much, thought Tyrion, as he pricked the ball of his thumb. He squeezed a fat drop of blood into the inkpot, traded the dagger for a fresh quill, and scrawled, Tyrion of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, in a big bold hand, just below Jorah Mormont\u2019s far more modest signature.\nAnd it\u2019s done. The dwarf rocked back on the camp stool. \u201cIs that all that you require of me? Don\u2019t I need to swear an oath? Kill a baby? Suck the captain\u2019s cock?\u201d\n\u201cSuck whatever you like.\u201d Inkpots turned the book around and dusted the page with a bit of fine sand. \u201cFor most of us, the signature suffices, but I would hate to disappoint a new brother-in-arms. Welcome to the Second Sons, Lord Tyrion.\u201d\nLord Tyrion. The dwarf liked the sound of that. The Second Sons might not enjoy the shining reputation of the Golden Company, but they had won some famous victories over the centuries. \u201cHave other lords served with the company?\u201d\n\u201cLandless lords,\u201d said Brown Ben. \u201cLike you, Imp.\u201d\nTyrion hopped down from the stool. \u201cMy previous brother was entirely unsatisfactory. I hope for more from my new ones. Now how do I go about securing arms and armor?\u201d\n\u201cWill you want a pig to ride as well?\u201d asked Kasporio.\n\u201cWhy, I did not know your wife was in the company,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to offer her, but I would prefer a horse.\u201d\nThe bravo reddened, but Inkpots laughed aloud and Brown Ben went so far as to chuckle. \u201cInkpots, show him to the wagons. He can have his pick from the company steel. The girl too. Put a helm on her, a bit o\u2019 mail, might be some will take her for a boy.\u201d\n\u201cLord Tyrion, with me.\u201d Inkpots held the tent flap to let him waddle through. \u201cI will have Snatch take you to the wagons. Get your woman and meet him by the cook tent.\u201d\n\u201cShe is not my woman. Perhaps you should get her. All she does of late is sleep and glare at me.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to beat her harder and fuck her more often,\u201d the paymaster offered helpfully. \u201cBring her, leave her, do what you will. Snatch will not care. Come find me when you have your armor, and I will start you on the ledgers.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d\nTyrion found Penny asleep in a corner of their tent, curled up on a thin straw pallet beneath a heap of soiled bedclothes. When he touched her with the toe of his boot, she rolled over, blinked at him, and yawned. \u201cHugor? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cTalking again, are we?\u201d It was better than her usual sullen silence. All over an abandoned dog and pig. I saved the two of us from slavery, you would think some gratitude might be in order. \u201cIf you sleep any longer, you\u2019re like to miss the war.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sad.\u201d She yawned again. \u201cAnd tired. So tired.\u201d\nTired or sick? Tyrion knelt beside her pallet. \u201cYou look pale.\u201d He felt her brow. Is it hot in here, or does she have a touch of fever? He dared not ask that question aloud. Even hard men like the Second Sons were terrified of mounting the pale mare. If they thought Penny was sick, they would drive her off without a moment\u2019s hesitation. They might even return us to Yezzan\u2019s heirs, notes or no notes. \u201cI have signed their book. The old way, in blood. I am now a Second Son.\u201d\nPenny sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \u201cWhat about me? Can I sign too?\u201d\n\u201cI think not. Some free companies have been known to take women, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0well, they are not Second Daughters, after all.\u201d\n\u201cWe,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of them, you should say we, not they. Has anyone seen Pretty Pig? Inkpots said he\u2019d ask after her. Or Crunch, has there been word of Crunch?\u201d\nOnly if you trust Kasporio. Plumm\u2019s not-so-cunning second-in-command claimed that three Yunkish slave-catchers were prowling through the camps, asking after a pair of escaped dwarfs. One of them was carrying a tall spear with a dog\u2019s head impaled upon its point, the way that Kaspo told it. Such tidings were not like to get Penny out of bed, however. \u201cNo word as yet,\u201d he lied. \u201cCome. We need to find some armor for you.\u201d\nShe gave him a wary look. \u201cArmor? Why?\u201d\n\u201cSomething my old master-at-arms told me. \u2018Never go to battle naked, lad,\u2019 he said. I take him at his word. Besides, now that I\u2019m a sellsword, I really ought to have a sword to sell.\u201d She still showed no signs of moving. Tyrion seized her by the wrist, pulled her to her feet, and threw a fistful of clothing into her face. \u201cDress. Wear the cloak with the hood and keep your head down. We\u2019re supposed to be a pair of likely lads, just in case the slave-catchers are watching.\u201d\nSnatch was waiting by the cook tent chewing sourleaf when the two dwarfs turned up, cloaked and hooded. \u201cI hear the two o\u2019 you are going to fight for us,\u201d the serjeant said. \u201cThat should have them pissing in Meereen. Either o\u2019 you ever killed a man?\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cI swat them down like flies.\u201d\n\u201cWhat with?\u201d\n\u201cAn axe, a dagger, a choice remark. Though I\u2019m deadliest with my crossbow.\u201d\nSnatch scratched at his stubble with the point of his hook. \u201cNasty thing, a crossbow. How many men you kill with that?\u201d\n\u201cNine.\u201d His father counted for at least that many, surely. Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, Hand of the King, husband, brother, father, father, father.\n\u201cNine.\u201d Snatch snorted and spat out a mouthful of red slime. Aiming for Tyrion\u2019s feet, perhaps, but it landed on his knee. Plainly that was what he thought of \u201cnine.\u201d The serjeant\u2019s fingers were stained a mottled red from the juice of the sourleaf he chewed. He put two of them into his mouth and whistled. \u201cKem! Get over here, you fucking pisspot.\u201d Kem came running. \u201cTake Lord and Lady Imp to the wagons, have Hammer fix them up with some company steel.\u201d\n\u201cHammer might be passed-out drunk,\u201d Kem cautioned.\n\u201cPiss in his face. That\u2019ll wake him up.\u201d Snatch turned back to Tyrion and Penny. \u201cWe never had no bloody dwarfs before, but boys we never lacked for. Sons o\u2019 this whore or that one, little fools run off from home to have adventures, butt boys, squires, and the like. Some o\u2019 their shit might be small enough to fit imps. It\u2019s the shit they were wearing when they died, like as not, but I know that won\u2019t bother fuckers fierce as you two. Nine, was it?\u201d He shook his head and walked away.\nThe Second Sons kept their company armor in six big wayns drawn up near the center of their camp. Kem led the way, swinging his spear as if it were a staff. \u201cHow does a King\u2019s Landing lad end up with a free company?\u201d Tyrion asked him.\nThe lad gave him a wary squint. \u201cWho told you I was from King\u2019s Landing?\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d Every word out of your mouth reeks of Flea Bottom. \u201cYour wits gave you away. There\u2019s no one clever as a Kingslander, they say.\u201d\nThat seemed to startle him. \u201cWho says that?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone.\u201d Me.\n\u201cSince when?\u201d\nSince I just made it up. \u201cFor ages,\u201d he lied. \u201cMy father was wont to say it. Did you know Lord Tywin, Kem?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hand. Once I saw him riding up the hill. His men had red cloaks and little lions on their helms. I liked those helms.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cI never liked the Hand, though. He sacked the city. And then he smashed us on the Blackwater.\u201d\n\u201cYou were there?\u201d\n\u201cWith Stannis. Lord Tywin come up with Renly\u2019s ghost and took us in the flank. I dropped my spear and ran, but at the ships this bloody knight said, \u2018Where\u2019s your spear, boy? We got no room for cravens,\u2019 and they buggered off and left me, and thousands more besides. Later I heard how your father was sending them as fought with Stannis to the Wall, so I made my way across the narrow sea and joined up with the Second Sons.\u201d\n\u201cDo you miss King\u2019s Landing?\u201d\n\u201cSome. I miss this boy, he\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he was a friend of mine. And my brother, Kennet, but he died on the bridge of ships.\u201d\n\u201cToo many good men died that day.\u201d Tyrion\u2019s scar was itching fiercely. He picked at it with a fingernail.\n\u201cI miss the food too,\u201d Kem said wistfully.\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s cooking?\u201d\n\u201cRats wouldn\u2019t eat my mother\u2019s cooking. There was this pot shop, though. No one ever made a bowl o\u2019 brown like them. So thick you could stand your spoon up in the bowl, with chunks of this and that. You ever have yourself a bowl o\u2019 brown, Halfman?\u201d\n\u201cA time or two. Singer\u2019s stew, I call it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt tastes so good it makes me want to sing.\u201d\nKem liked that. \u201cSinger\u2019s stew. I\u2019ll ask for that next time I get back to Flea Bottom. What do you miss, Halfman?\u201d\nJaime, thought Tyrion. Shae. Tysha. My wife, I miss my wife, the wife I hardly knew. \u201cWine, whores, and wealth,\u201d he answered. \u201cEspecially the wealth. Wealth will buy you wine and whores.\u201d It will also buy you swords, and the Kems to wield them.\n\u201cIs it true the chamber pots in Casterly Rock are made of solid gold?\u201d Kem asked him.\n\u201cYou should not believe everything you hear. Especially where House Lannister is concerned.\u201d\n\u201cThey say all Lannisters are twisty snakes.\u201d\n\u201cSnakes?\u201d Tyrion laughed. \u201cThat sound you hear is my lord father, slithering in his grave. We are lions, or so we like to say. But it makes no matter, Kem. Step on a snake or a lion\u2019s tail, you\u2019ll end up just as dead.\u201d\nBy then they had reached the armory, such as it was. The smith, this fabled Hammer, proved to be a freakish-looking hulk with a left arm that appeared twice as thick as his right. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk more than not,\u201d Kem said. \u201cBrown Ben lets it go, but one day we\u2019ll get us a real armorer.\u201d Hammer\u2019s apprentice was a wiry red-haired youth called Nail. Of course. What else? mused Tyrion. Hammer was sleeping off a drunk when they reached the forge, just as Kem had prophesied, but Nail had no objection to the two dwarfs clambering through the wagons. \u201cCrap iron, most of it,\u201d he warned them, \u201cbut you\u2019re welcome to anything you can use.\u201d\nUnder roofs of bent wood and stiffened leather, the wagon beds were heaped high with old weaponry and armor. Tyrion took one look and sighed, remembering the gleaming racks of swords and spears and halberds in the armory of the Lannisters below Casterly Rock. \u201cThis may take a while,\u201d he declared.\n\u201cThere\u2019s sound steel here if you can find it,\u201d a deep voice growled. \u201cNone of it is pretty, but it will stop a sword.\u201d\nA big knight stepped down from the back of a wagon, clad head to heel in company steel. His left greave did not match his right, his gorget was spotted with rust, his vambraces rich and ornate, inlaid with niello flowers. On his right hand was a gauntlet of lobstered steel, on his left a fingerless mitt of rusted mail. The nipples on his muscled breastplate had a pair of iron rings through them. His greathelm sported a ram\u2019s horns, one of which was broken.\nWhen he took it off, he revealed the battered face of Jorah Mormont.\nHe looks every inch a sellsword and not at all like the half-broken thing we took from Yezzan\u2019s cage, Tyrion reflected. His bruises had mostly faded by now, and the swelling in his face had largely subsided, so Mormont looked almost human once again\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though only vaguely like himself. The demon\u2019s mask the slavers had burned into his right cheek to mark him for a dangerous and disobedient slave would never leave him. Ser Jorah had never been what one might call a comely man. The brand had transformed his face into something frightening.\nTyrion grinned. \u201cAs long as I look prettier than you, I will be happy.\u201d He turned to Penny. \u201cYou take that wagon. I\u2019ll start with this one.\u201d\n\u201cIt will go faster if we look together.\u201d She plucked up a rusted iron halfhelm, giggled, and stuck it on her head. \u201cDo I look fearsome?\u201d\nYou look like a mummer girl with a pot on her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a halfhelm. You want a greathelm.\u201d He found one, and swapped it for the halfhelm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too big.\u201d Penny\u2019s voice echoed hollowly inside the steel. \u201cI can\u2019t see out.\u201d She took the helm off and flung it aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the halfhelm?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s open-faced.\u201d Tyrion pinched her nose. \u201cI am fond of looking at your nose. I would rather that you kept it.\u201d\nHer eyes got big. \u201cYou like my nose?\u201d\nOh, Seven save me. Tyrion turned away and began rooting amongst some piles of old armor toward the back of the wagon.\n\u201cAre there any other parts of me you like?\u201d Penny asked.\nPerhaps she meant that to sound playful. It sounded sad instead. \u201cI am fond of all of your parts,\u201d Tyrion said, in hopes of ending any further discussion of the subject, \u201cand even fonder of mine own.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should we need armor? We\u2019re only mummers. We just pretend to fight.\u201d\n\u201cYou pretend very well,\u201d said Tyrion, examining a shirt of heavy iron mail so full of holes that it almost looked moth-eaten. What sort of moths eat chainmail? \u201cPretending to be dead is one way to survive a battle. Good armor is another.\u201d Though there is precious little of that here, I fear. At the Green Fork, he had fought in mismatched scraps of plate from Lord Lefford\u2019s wagons, with a spiked bucket helm that made it look as if someone had upended a slops pail over his head. This company steel was worse. Not just old and ill fitting, but dinted, cracked, and brittle. Is that dried blood, or only rust? He sniffed at it but still could not be sure.\n\u201cHere\u2019s a crossbow.\u201d Penny showed it to him.\nTyrion glanced at it. \u201cI cannot use a stirrup winch. My legs are not long enough. A crank would serve me better.\u201d Though, if truth be told, he did not want a crossbow. They took too long to reload. Even if he lurked by the latrine ditch waiting for some enemy to take a squat, the chances of his losing more than one quarrel would not be good.\nInstead he picked up a morningstar, gave it a swing, put it down again. Too heavy. He passed over a warhammer (too long), a studded mace (also too heavy), and half a dozen longswords before he found a dirk he liked, a nasty piece of steel with a triangular blade. \u201cThis might serve,\u201d he said. The blade had a bit of rust on it, but that would only make it nastier. He found a wood-and-leather sheath that fit and slipped the dirk inside.\n\u201cA little sword for a little man?\u201d joked Penny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dirk and made for a big man.\u201d Tyrion showed her an old longsword. \u201cThis is a sword. Try it.\u201d\nPenny took it, swung it, frowned. \u201cToo heavy.\u201d\n\u201cSteel weighs more than wood. Chop through a man\u2019s neck with that thing, though, and his head is not like to turn into a melon.\u201d He took the sword back from her and inspected it more closely. \u201cCheap steel. And notched. Here, see? I take back what I said. You need a better blade to hack off heads.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hack off heads.\u201d\n\u201cNor should you. Keep your cuts below the knee. Calf, hamstring, ankle\u00a0\u2026\u00a0even giants fall if you slice their feet off. Once they\u2019re down, they\u2019re no bigger than you.\u201d\nPenny looked as though she was about to cry. \u201cLast night I dreamed my brother was alive again. We were jousting before some great lord, riding Crunch and Pretty Pig, and men were throwing roses at us. We were so happy\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nTyrion slapped her.\nIt was a soft blow, all in all, a little flick of the wrist, with hardly any force behind it. It did not even leave a mark upon her cheek. But her eyes filled with tears all the same.\n\u201cIf you want to dream, go back to sleep,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhen you wake up, we\u2019ll still be escaped slaves in the middle of a siege. Crunch is dead. The pig as well, most like. Now find some armor and put it on, and never mind where it pinches. The mummer show is over. Fight or hide or shit yourself, as you like, but whatever you decide to do, you\u2019ll do it clad in steel.\u201d\nPenny touched the cheek he\u2019d slapped. \u201cWe should never have run. We\u2019re not sellswords. We\u2019re not any kind of swords. It wasn\u2019t so bad with Yezzan. It wasn\u2019t. Nurse was cruel sometimes but Yezzan never was. We were his favorites, his\u00a0\u2026\u00a0his\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSlaves. The word you want is slaves.\u201d\n\u201cSlaves,\u201d she said, flushing. \u201cWe were his special slaves, though. Just like Sweets. His treasures.\u201d\nHis pets, thought Tyrion. And he loved us so much that he sent us to the pit, to be devoured by lions.\nShe was not all wrong. Yezzan\u2019s slaves ate better than many peasants back in the Seven Kingdoms and were less like to starve to death come winter. Slaves were chattels, aye. They could be bought and sold, whipped and branded, used for the carnal pleasure of their owners, bred to make more slaves. In that sense they were no more than dogs or horses. But most lords treated their dogs and horses well enough. Proud men might shout that they would sooner die free than live as slaves, but pride was cheap. When the steel struck the flint, such men were rare as dragon\u2019s teeth; elsewise the world would not have been so full of slaves. There has never been a slave who did not choose to be a slave, the dwarf reflected. Their choice may be between bondage and death, but the choice is always there.\nTyrion Lannister did not except himself. His tongue had earned him some stripes on the back in the beginning, but soon enough he had learned the tricks of pleasing Nurse and the noble Yezzan. Jorah Mormont had fought longer and harder, but he would have come to the same place in the end.\nAnd Penny, well\u00a0\u2026\nPenny had been searching for a new master since the day her brother Groat had lost his head. She wants someone to take care of her, someone to tell her what to do.\nIt would have been too cruel to say so, however. Instead Tyrion said, \u201cYezzan\u2019s special slaves did not escape the pale mare. They\u2019re dead, the lot of them. Sweets was the first to go.\u201d Their mammoth master had died on the day of their escape, Brown Ben Plumm had told him. Neither he nor Kasporio nor any of the other sellswords knew the fate of the denizens of Yezzan\u2019s grotesquerie\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but if Pretty Penny needed lies to stop her mooning, lie to her he would. \u201cIf you want to be a slave again, I will find you a kind master when this war is done, and sell you for enough gold to get me home,\u201d Tyrion promised her. \u201cI\u2019ll find you some nice Yunkishman to give you another pretty golden collar, with little bells on it that will tinkle everywhere you go. First, though, you will need to survive what\u2019s coming. No one buys dead mummers.\u201d\n\u201cOr dead dwarfs,\u201d said Jorah Mormont. \u201cWe are all like to be feeding worms by the time this battle is done. The Yunkai\u2019i have lost this war, though it may take them some time to know it. Meereen has an army of Unsullied infantry, the finest in the world. And Meereen has dragons. Three of them, once the queen returns. She will. She must. Our side consists of two score Yunkish lordlings, each with his own half-trained monkey men. Slaves on stilts, slaves in chains\u00a0\u2026\u00a0they may have troops of blind men and palsied children too, I would not put it past them.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThe Second Sons are on the losing side. They need to turn their cloaks again and do it now.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLeave that to me.\u201d",

      "content": "THE KINGBREAKER\nA pale shadow and a dark, the two conspirators came together in the quiet of the armory on the Great Pyramid\u2019s second level, amongst racks of spears, sheaves of quarrels, and walls hung with trophies from forgotten battles.\n\u201cTonight,\u201d said Skahaz mo Kandaq. The brass face of a blood bat peered out from beneath the hood of his patchwork cloak. \u201cAll my men will be in place. The word is Groleo.\u201d\n\u201cGroleo.\u201d That is fitting, I suppose. \u201cYes. What was done to him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you were at court?\u201d\n\u201cOne guardsman amongst forty. All waiting for the empty tabard on the throne to speak the command so we might cut down Bloodbeard and the rest. Do you think the Yunkai\u2019i would ever have dared present Daenerys with the head of her hostage?\u201d\nNo, thought Selmy. \u201cHizdahr seemed distraught.\u201d\n\u201cSham. His own kin of Loraq were returned unharmed. You saw. The Yunkai\u2019i played us a mummer\u2019s farce, with noble Hizdahr as chief mummer. The issue was never Yurkhaz zo Yunzak. The other slavers would gladly have trampled that old fool themselves. This was to give Hizdahr a pretext to kill the dragons.\u201d\nSer Barristan chewed on that. \u201cWould he dare?\u201d\n\u201cHe dared to kill his queen. Why not her pets? If we do not act, Hizdahr will hesitate for a time, to give proof of his reluctance and allow the Wise Masters the chance to rid him of the Stormcrow and the bloodrider. Then he will act. They want the dragons dead before the Volantene fleet arrives.\u201d\nAye, they would. It all fit. That did not mean Barristan Selmy liked it any better. \u201cThat will not happen.\u201d His queen was the Mother of Dragons; he would not allow her children to come to harm. \u201cThe hour of the wolf. The blackest part of night, when all the world\u2019s asleep.\u201d He had first heard those words from Tywin Lannister outside the walls of Duskendale. He gave me a day to bring out Aerys. Unless I returned with the king by dawn of the following day, he would take the town with steel and fire, he told me. It was the hour of the wolf when I went in and the hour of the wolf when we emerged. \u201cGrey Worm and the Unsullied will close and bar the gates at first light.\u201d\n\u201cBetter to attack at first light,\u201d Skahaz said. \u201cBurst from the gates and swarm across the siege lines, smash the Yunkai\u2019i as they come stumbling from their beds.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The two of them had argued this before. \u201cThere is a peace, signed and sealed by Her Grace the queen. We will not be the first to break it. Once we have taken Hizdahr, we will form a council to rule in his place and demand that the Yunkai\u2019i return our hostages and withdraw their armies. Should they refuse, then and only then will we inform them that the peace is broken, and go forth to give them battle. Your way is dishonorable.\u201d\n\u201cYour way is stupid,\u201d the Shavepate said. \u201cThe hour is ripe. Our freedmen are ready. Hungry.\u201d\nThat much was true, Selmy knew. Symon Stripeback of the Free Brothers and Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields were both eager for battle, intent on proving themselves and washing out all the wrongs they had suffered in a tide of Yunkish blood. Only Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men shared Ser Barristan\u2019s doubts. \u201cWe discussed this. You agreed it would be my way.\u201d\n\u201cI agreed,\u201d the Shavepate grumbled, \u201cbut that was before Groleo. The head. The slavers have no honor.\u201d\n\u201cWe do,\u201d said Ser Barristan.\nThe Shavepate muttered something in Ghiscari, then said, \u201cAs you wish. Though we will rue your old man\u2019s honor before this game is done, I think. What of Hizdahr\u2019s guards?\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace keeps two men by him when he sleeps. One on the door of his bedchamber, a second within, in an adjoining alcove. Tonight it will be Khrazz and Steelskin.\u201d\n\u201cKhrazz,\u201d the Shavepate grumbled. \u201cThat I do not like.\u201d\n\u201cIt need not come to blood,\u201d Ser Barristan told him. \u201cI mean to talk to Hizdahr. If he understands we do not intend to kill him, he may command his guards to yield.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if not? Hizdahr must not escape us.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not escape.\u201d Selmy did not fear Khrazz, much less Steelskin. They were only pit fighters. Hizdahr\u2019s fearsome collection of former fighting slaves made indifferent guards at best. Speed and strength and ferocity they had, and some skill at arms as well, but blood games were poor training for protecting kings. In the pits their foes were announced with horns and drums, and after the battle was done and won the victors could have their wounds bound up and quaff some milk of the poppy for the pain, knowing that the threat was past and they were free to drink and feast and whore until the next fight. But the battle was never truly done for a knight of the Kingsguard. Threats came from everywhere and nowhere, at any time of day or night. No trumpets announced the foe: vassals, servants, friends, brothers, sons, even wives, any of them might have knives concealed beneath their cloaks and murder hidden in their hearts. For every hour of fighting, a Kingsguard knight spent ten thousand hours watching, waiting, standing silent in the shadows. King Hizdahr\u2019s pit fighters were already growing bored and restive with their new duties, and bored men were lax, slow to react.\n\u201cI shall deal with Khrazz,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cJust make certain I do not need to deal with any Brazen Beasts as well.\u201d\n\u201cHave no fear. We will have Marghaz in chains before he can make mischief. I told you, the Brazen Beasts are mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou say you have men amongst the Yunkishmen?\u201d\n\u201cSneaks and spies. Reznak has more.\u201d\nReznak cannot be trusted. He smells too sweet and feels too foul. \u201cSomeone needs to free our hostages. Unless we get our people back, the Yunkai\u2019i will use them against us.\u201d\nSkahaz snorted through the noseholes of his mask. \u201cEasy to speak of rescue. Harder to do. Let the slavers threaten.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if they do more than threaten?\u201d\n\u201cWould you miss them so much, old man? A eunuch, a savage, and a sell sword?\u201d\nHero, Jhogo, and Daario. \u201cJhogo is the queen\u2019s bloodrider, blood of her blood. They came out of the Red Waste together. Hero is Grey Worm\u2019s second-in-command. And Daario\u00a0\u2026\u201d She loves Daario. He had seen it in her eyes when she looked at him, heard it in her voice when she spoke of him. \u201c\u2026\u00a0Daario is vain and rash, but he is dear to Her Grace. He must be rescued, before his Stormcrows decide to take matters into their own hands. It can be done. I once brought the queen\u2019s father safely out of Duskendale, where he was being held captive by a rebel lord, but\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0you could never hope to pass unnoticed amongst the Yunkai\u2019i. Every man of them knows your face by now.\u201d\nI could hide my face, like you, thought Selmy, but he knew the Shavepate was right. Duskendale had been a lifetime ago. He was too old for such heroics. \u201cThen we must needs find some other way. Some other rescuer. Someone known to the Yunkishmen, whose presence in their camp might go unnoticed\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDaario calls you Ser Grandfather,\u201d Skahaz reminded him. \u201cI will not say what he calls me. If you and I were the hostages, would he risk his skin for us?\u201d\nNot likely, he thought, but he said, \u201cHe might.\u201d\n\u201cDaario might piss on us if we were burning. Elsewise do not look to him for help. Let the Stormcrows choose another captain, one who knows his place. If the queen does not return, the world will be one sellsword short. Who will grieve?\u201d\n\u201cAnd when she does return?\u201d\n\u201cShe will weep and tear her hair and curse the Yunkai\u2019i. Not us. No blood on our hands. You can comfort her. Tell her some tale of the old days, she likes those. Poor Daario, her brave captain\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she will never forget him, no\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but better for all of us if he is dead, yes? Better for Daenerys too.\u201d\nBetter for Daenerys, and for Westeros. Daenerys Targaryen loved her captain, but that was the girl in her, not the queen. Prince Rhaegar loved his Lady Lyanna, and thousands died for it. Daemon Blackfyre loved the first Daenerys, and rose in rebellion when denied her. Bittersteel and Bloodraven both loved Shiera Seastar, and the Seven Kingdoms bled. The Prince of Dragonflies loved Jenny of Oldstones so much he cast aside a crown, and Westeros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the fifth Aegon had wed for love, in defiance of their father\u2019s wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had himself followed his heart when he chose his queen, he allowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies where he might have had fast friends. Treason and turmoil followed, as night follows day, ending at Summerhall in sorcery, fire, and grief.\nHer love for Daario is poison. A slower poison than the locusts, but in the end as deadly. \u201cThere is still Jhogo,\u201d Ser Barristan said. \u201cHim, and Hero. Both precious to Her Grace.\u201d\n\u201cWe have hostages as well,\u201d Skahaz Shavepate reminded him. \u201cIf the slavers kill one of ours, we kill one of theirs.\u201d\nFor a moment Ser Barristan did not know whom he meant. Then it came to him. \u201cThe queen\u2019s cupbearers?\u201d\n\u201cHostages,\u201d insisted Skahaz mo Kandaq. \u201cGrazdar and Qezza are the blood of the Green Grace. Mezzara is of Merreq, Kezmya is Pahl, Azzak Ghazeen. Bhakaz is Loraq, Hizdahr\u2019s own kin. All are sons and daughters of the pyramids. Zhak, Quazzar, Uhlez, Hazkar, Dhazak, Yherizan, all children of Great Masters.\u201d\n\u201cInnocent girls and sweet-faced boys.\u201d Ser Barristan had come to know them all during the time they served the queen, Grazhar with his dreams of glory, shy Mezzara, lazy Miklaz, vain, pretty Kezmya, Qezza with her big soft eyes and angel\u2019s voice, Dhazzar the dancer, and the rest. \u201cChildren.\u201d\n\u201cChildren of the Harpy. Only blood can pay for blood.\u201d\n\u201cSo said the Yunkishman who brought us Groleo\u2019s head.\u201d\n\u201cHe was not wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI will not permit it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat use are hostages if they may not be touched?\u201d\n\u201cMayhaps we might offer three of the children for Daario, Hero, and Jhogo,\u201d Ser Barristan allowed. \u201cHer Grace\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is not here. It is for you and me to do what must be done. You know that I am right.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Rhaegar had two children,\u201d Ser Barristan told him. \u201cRhaenys was a little girl, Aegon a babe in arms. When Tywin Lannister took King\u2019s Landing, his men killed both of them. He served the bloody bodies up in crimson cloaks, a gift for the new king.\u201d And what did Robert say when he saw them? Did he smile? Barristan Selmy had been badly wounded on the Trident, so he had been spared the sight of Lord Tywin\u2019s gift, but oft he wondered. If I had seen him smile over the red ruins of Rhaegar\u2019s children, no army on this earth could have stopped me from killing him. \u201cI will not suffer the murder of children. Accept that, or I\u2019ll have no part of this.\u201d\nSkahaz chuckled. \u201cYou are a stubborn old man. Your sweet-faced boys will only grow up to be Sons of the Harpy. Kill them now or kill them then.\u201d\n\u201cYou kill men for the wrongs they have done, not the wrongs that they may do someday.\u201d\nThe Shavepate took an axe down off the wall, inspected it, and grunted. \u201cSo be it. No harm to Hizdahr or our hostages. Will that content you, Ser Grandfather?\u201d\nNothing about this will content me. \u201cIt will serve. The hour of the wolf. Remember.\u201d\n\u201cI am not like to forget, ser.\u201d Though the bat\u2019s brass mouth did not move, Ser Barristan could sense the grin beneath the mask. \u201cLong has Kandaq waited for this night.\u201d\nThat is what I fear. If King Hizdahr was innocent, what they did this day would be treason. But how could he be innocent? Selmy had heard him urging Daenerys to taste the poisoned locusts, shouting at his men to slay the dragon. If we do not act, Hizdahr will kill the dragons and open the gates to the queen\u2019s enemies. We have no choice in this. Yet no matter how he turned and twisted this, the old knight could find no honor in it.\nThe rest of that long day raced past as swiftly as a snail.\nElsewhere, he knew, King Hizdahr was consulting with Reznak mo Reznak, Marghaz zo Loraq, Galazza Galare, and his other Meereenese advisors, deciding how best to respond to Yunkai\u2019s demands\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Barristan Selmy was no longer a part of such councils. Nor did he have a king to guard. Instead he made the rounds of the pyramid from top to bottom, to ascertain that the sentries were all at their posts. That took most of the morning. He spent that afternoon with his orphans, even took up sword and shield himself to provide a sterner test for a few of the older lads.\nSome of them had been training for the fighting pits when Daenerys Targaryen took Meereen and freed them from their chains. Those had had a good acquaintance with sword and spear and battle-axe even before Ser Barristan got hold of them. A few might well be ready. The boy from the Basilisk Isles, for a start. Tumco Lho. Black as maester\u2019s ink he was, but fast and strong, the best natural swordsman Selmy had seen since Jaime Lannister. Larraq as well. The Lash. Ser Barristan did not approve of his fighting style, but there was no doubting his skills. Larraq had years of work ahead of him before he mastered proper knightly weapons, sword and lance and mace, but he was deadly with his whip and trident. The old knight had warned him that the whip would be useless against an armored foe\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until he saw how Larraq used it, snapping it around the legs of his opponents to yank them off their feet. No knight as yet, but a fierce fighter.\nLarraq and Tumco were his best. After them the Lhazarene, the one the other boys called Red Lamb, though as yet that one was all ferocity and no technique. Perhaps the brothers too, three lowborn Ghiscari enslaved to pay their father\u2019s debts.\nThat made six. Six out of twenty-seven. Selmy might have hoped for more, but six was a good beginning. The other boys were younger for the most part, and more familiar with looms and plows and chamber pots than swords and shields, but they worked hard and learned quickly. A few years as squires, and he might have six more knights to give his queen. As for those who would never be ready, well, not every boy was meant to be a knight. The realm needs candlemakers and innkeeps and armorers as well. That was as true in Meereen as it was in Westeros.\nAs he watched them at their drills, Ser Barristan pondered raising Tumco and Larraq to knighthood then and there, and mayhaps the Red Lamb too. It required a knight to make a knight, and if something should go awry tonight, dawn might find him dead or in a dungeon. Who would dub his squires then? On the other hand, a young knight\u2019s repute derived at least in part from the honor of the man who conferred knighthood on him. It would do his lads no good at all if it was known that they were given their spurs by a traitor, and might well land them in the dungeon next to him. They deserve better, Ser Barristan decided. Better a long life as a squire than a short one as a soiled knight.\nAs the afternoon melted into evening, he bid his charges to lay down their swords and shields and gather round. He spoke to them about what it meant to be a knight. \u201cIt is chivalry that makes a true knight, not a sword,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout honor, a knight is no more than a common killer. It is better to die with honor than to live without it.\u201d The boys looked at him strangely, he thought, but one day they would understand.\nAfterward, back at the apex of the pyramid, Ser Barristan found Missandei amongst piles of scrolls and books, reading. \u201cStay here tonight, child,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhatever happens, whatever you see or hear, do not leave the queen\u2019s chambers.\u201d\n\u201cThis one hears,\u201d the girl said. \u201cIf she may ask\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBest not.\u201d Ser Barristan stepped out alone onto the terrace gardens. I am not made for this, he reflected as he looked out over the sprawling city. The pyramids were waking, one by one, lanterns and torches flickering to life as shadows gathered in the streets below. Plots, ploys, whispers, lies, secrets within secrets, and somehow I have become part of them.\nPerhaps by now he should have grown used to such things. The Red Keep had its secrets too. Even Rhaegar. The Prince of Dragonstone had never trusted him as he had trusted Arthur Dayne. Harrenhal was proof of that. The year of the false spring.\nThe memory was still bitter. Old Lord Whent had announced the tourney shortly after a visit from his brother, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard. With Varys whispering in his ear, King Aerys became convinced that his son was conspiring to depose him, that Whent\u2019s tourney was but a ploy to give Rhaegar a pretext for meeting with as many great lords as could be brought together. Aerys had not set foot outside the Red Keep since Duskendale, yet suddenly he announced that he would accompany Prince Rhaegar to Harrenhal, and everything had gone awry from there.\nIf I had been a better knight\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if I had unhorsed the prince in that last tilt, as I unhorsed so many others, it would have been for me to choose the queen of love and beauty\u00a0\u2026\nRhaegar had chosen Lyanna Stark of Winterfell. Barristan Selmy would have made a different choice. Not the queen, who was not present. Nor Elia of Dorne, though she was good and gentle; had she been chosen, much war and woe might have been avoided. His choice would have been a young maiden not long at court, one of Elia\u2019s companions\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though compared to Ashara Dayne, the Dornish princess was a kitchen drab.\nEven after all these years, Ser Barristan could still recall Ashara\u2019s smile, the sound of her laughter. He had only to close his eyes to see her, with her long dark hair tumbling about her shoulders and those haunting purple eyes. Daenerys has the same eyes. Sometimes when the queen looked at him, he felt as if he were looking at Ashara\u2019s daughter\u00a0\u2026\nBut Ashara\u2019s daughter had been stillborn, and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after, mad with grief for the child she had lost, and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at Harrenhal as well. She died never knowing that Ser Barristan had loved her. How could she? He was a knight of the Kingsguard, sworn to celibacy. No good could have come from telling her his feelings. No good came from silence either. If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of Stark?\nHe would never know. But of all his failures, none haunted Barristan Selmy so much as that.\nThe sky was overcast, the air hot, muggy, oppressive, yet there was something in it that made his spine tingle. Rain, he thought. A storm is coming. If not tonight, upon the morrow. Ser Barristan wondered if he would live to see it. If Hizdahr has his own Spider, I am as good as dead. Should it come to that, he meant to die as he had lived, with his longsword in his hand.\nWhen the last light had faded in the west, behind the sails of the prowling ships on Slaver\u2019s Bay, Ser Barristan went back inside, summoned a pair of serving men, and told them to heat some water for a bath. Sparring with his squires in the afternoon heat had left him feeling soiled and sweaty.\nThe water, when it came, was only lukewarm, but Selmy lingered in the bath until it had grown cold and scrubbed his skin till it was raw. Clean as he had ever been, he rose, dried himself, and clad himself in whites. Stockings, smallclothes, silken tunic, padded jerkin, all fresh-washed and bleached. Over that he donned the armor that the queen had given him as a token of her esteem. The mail was gilded, finely wrought, the links as supple as good leather, the plate enameled, hard as ice and bright as new-fallen snow. His dagger went on one hip, his longsword on the other, hung from a white leather belt with golden buckles. Last of all he took down his long white cloak and fastened it about his shoulders.\nThe helm he left upon its hook. The narrow eye slit limited his vision, and he needed to be able to see for what was to come. The halls of the pyramid were dark at night, and foes could come at you from either side. Besides, though the ornate dragon\u2019s wings that adorned the helm were splendid to look upon, they could too easily catch a sword or axe. He would leave them for his next tourney if the Seven should grant him one.\nArmed and armored, the old knight waited, sitting in the gloom of his small chamber adjoining the queen\u2019s apartments. The faces of all the kings that he had served and failed floated before him in the darkness, and the faces of the brothers who had served beside him in the Kingsguard as well. He wondered how many of them would have done what he was about to do. Some, surely. But not all. Some would not have hesitated to strike down the Shavepate as a traitor. Outside the pyramid, it began to rain. Ser Barristan sat along in the dark, listening. It sounds like tears, he thought. It sounds like dead kings, weeping.\nThen it was time to go.\nThe Great Pyramid of Meereen had been built as an echo to the Great Pyramid of Ghis whose collossal ruins Lomas Longstrider had once visited. Like its ancient predecessor, whose red marble halls were now the haunt of bats and spiders, the Meereenese pyramid boasted three-and-thirty levels, that number being somehow sacred to the gods of Ghis. Ser Barristan began the long descent alone, his white cloak rippling behind him as he started down. He took the servants\u2019 steps, not the grand stairways of veined marble, but the narrower, steeper, straighter stairs hidden within the thick brick walls.\nTwelve levels down he found the Shavepate waiting, his coarse features still hidden by the mask he had worn that morning, the blood bat. Six Brazen Beasts were with him. All were masked as insects, identical to one another.\nLocusts, Selmy realized. \u201cGroleo,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGroleo,\u201d one of the locusts replied.\n\u201cI have more locusts if you need them,\u201d said Skahaz.\n\u201cSix should serve. What of the men on the doors?\u201d\n\u201cMine. You will have no trouble.\u201d\nSer Barristan clasped the Shavepate by the arm. \u201cShed no blood unless you must. Come the morrow we will convene a council and tell the city what we\u2019ve done and why.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. Good fortune to you, old man.\u201d\nThey went their separate ways. The Brazen Beasts fell in behind Ser Barristan as he continued his descent.\nThe king\u2019s apartments were buried in the very heart of the pyramid, on the sixteenth and seventeenth levels. When Selmy reached those floors, he found the doors to the interior of the pyramid chained shut, with a pair of Brazen Beasts posted as guards. Beneath the hoods of their patchwork cloaks, one was a rat, the other a bull.\n\u201cGroleo,\u201d Ser Barristan said.\n\u201cGroleo,\u201d the bull returned. \u201cThird hall to the right.\u201d The rat unlocked the chain. Ser Barristan and his escort stepped through into a narrow, torchlit servants\u2019 corridor of red and black brick. Their footsteps echoed on the floors as they strode past two halls and took the third one to the right.\nOutside the carved hardwood doors to the king\u2019s chambers stood Steelskin, a younger pit fighter, not yet regarded as of the first rank. His cheeks and brow were scarred with intricate tattoos in green and black, ancient Valyrian sorcerer\u2019s signs that supposedly made his flesh and skin as hard as steel. Similar markings covered his chest and arms, though whether they would actually stop a sword or axe remained to be seen.\nEven without them, Steelskin looked formidable\u2014a lean and wiry youth who overtopped Ser Barristan by half a foot. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d he called out, swinging his longaxe sideways to bar their way. When he saw Ser Barristan, with the brass locusts behind him, he lowered it again. \u201cOld Ser.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please the king, I must needs have words with him.\u201d\n\u201cThe hour is late.\u201d\n\u201cThe hour is late, but the need is urgent.\u201d\n\u201cI can ask.\u201d Steelskin slammed the butt of his longaxe against the door to the king\u2019s apartments. A slidehole opened. A child\u2019s eye appeared. A child\u2019s voice called through the door. Steelskin replied. Ser Barristan heard the sound of a heavy bar being drawn back. The door swung open.\n\u201cOnly you,\u201d said Steelskin. \u201cThe beasts wait here.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Ser Barristan nodded to the locusts. One returned his nod. Alone, Selmy slipped through the door.\nDark and windowless, surrounded on all sides by brick walls eight feet thick, the chambers that the king had made his own were large and luxurious within. Great beams of black oak supported the high ceilings. The floors were covered with silk carpets out of Qarth. On the walls were priceless tapestries, ancient and much faded, depicting the glory of the Old Empire of Ghis. The largest of them showed the last survivors of a defeated Valyrian army passing beneath the yoke and being chained. The archway leading to the royal bedchamber was guarded by a pair of sandalwood lovers, shaped and smoothed and oiled. Ser Barristan found them distasteful, though no doubt they were meant to be arousing. The sooner we are gone from this place, the better.\nAn iron brazier gave the only light. Beside it stood two of the queen\u2019s cupbearers, Draqaz and Qezza. \u201cMiklaz has gone to wake the king,\u201d said Qezza. \u201cMay we bring you wine, ser?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou may sit,\u201d said Draqaz, indicating a bench.\n\u201cI prefer to stand.\u201d He could hear voices drifting through the archway from the bedchamber. One of them was the king\u2019s.\nIt was still a good few moments before King Hizdahr zo Loraq, Fourteenth of That Noble Name, emerged yawning, knotting the sash that closed his robe. The robe was green satin, richly worked with pearls and silver thread. Under it the king was quite naked. That was good. Naked men felt vulnerable and were less inclined to acts of suicidal heroism.\nThe woman Ser Barristan glimpsed peering through the archway from behind a gauzy curtain was naked as well, her breasts and hips only partially concealed by the blowing silk.\n\u201cSer Barristan.\u201d Hizdahr yawned again. \u201cWhat hour is it? Is there news of my sweet queen?\u201d\n\u201cNone, Your Grace.\u201d\nHizdahr sighed. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Your Magnificence,\u2019 please. Though at his hour, \u2018Your Sleepiness\u2019 would be more apt.\u201d The king crossed to the sideboard to pour himself a cup of wine, but only a trickle remained in the bottom of the flagon. A flicker of annoyance crossed his face. \u201cMiklaz, wine. At once.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Your Worship.\u201d\n\u201cTake Draqaz with you. One flagon of Arbor gold, and one of that sweet red. None of our yellow piss, thank you. And the next time I find my flagon dry, I may have to take a switch to those pretty pink cheeks of yours.\u201d The boy went running off, and the king turned back to Selmy. \u201cI dreamed you found Daenerys.\u201d\n\u201cDreams can lie, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Your Radiance\u2019 would serve. What brings you to me at this hour, ser? Some trouble in the city?\u201d\n\u201cThe city is tranquil.\u201d\n\u201cIs it so?\u201d Hizdahr looked confused. \u201cWhy have you come?\u201d\n\u201cTo ask a question. Magnificence, are you the Harpy?\u201d\nHizdahr\u2019s wine cup slipped through his fingers, bounced off the carpet, rolled. \u201cYou come to my bedchamber in the black of night and ask me that? Are you mad?\u201d It was only then that the king seemed to notice that Ser Barristan was wearing his plate and mail. \u201cWhat\u00a0\u2026\u00a0why\u00a0\u2026\u00a0how dare you\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWas the poison your work, Magnificence?\u201d\nKing Hizdahr backed away a step. \u201cThe locusts? That\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that was the Dornishman. Quentyn, the so-called prince. Ask Reznak if you doubt me.\u201d\n\u201cHave you proof of that? Has Reznak?\u201d\n\u201cNo, else I would have had them seized. Perhaps I should do so in any case. Marghaz will wring a confession out of them, I do not doubt. They\u2019re all poisoners, these Dornish. Reznak says they worship snakes.\u201d\n\u201cThey eat snakes,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cIt was your pit, your box, your seats. Sweet wine and soft cushions, figs and melons and honeyed locusts. You provided all. You urged Her Grace to try the locusts but never tasted one yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0hot spices do not agree with me. She was my wife. My queen. Why would I want to poison her?\u201d\nWas, he says. He believes her dead. \u201cOnly you can answer that, Magnificence. It might be that you wished to put another woman in her place.\u201d Ser Barristan nodded at the girl peering timidly from the bedchamber. \u201cThat one, perhaps?\u201d\nThe king looked around wildly. \u201cHer? She\u2019s nothing. A bedslave.\u201d He raised his hands. \u201cI misspoke. Not a slave. A free woman. Trained in pleasure. Even a king has needs, she\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she is none of your concern, ser. I would never harm Daenerys. Never.\u201d\n\u201cYou urged the queen to try the locusts. I heard you.\u201d\n\u201cI thought she might enjoy them.\u201d Hizdahr retreated another step. \u201cHot and sweet at once.\u201d\n\u201cHot and sweet and poisoned. With mine own ears I heard you commanding the men in the pit to kill Drogon. Shouting at them.\u201d\nHizdahr licked his lips. \u201cThe beast devoured Barsena\u2019s flesh. Dragons prey on men. It was killing, burning\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0burning men who meant harm to your queen. Harpy\u2019s Sons, as like as not. Your friends.\u201d\n\u201cNot my friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that, yet when you told them to stop killing they obeyed. Why would they do that if you were not one of them?\u201d\nHizdahr shook his head. This time he did not answer.\n\u201cTell me true,\u201d Ser Barristan said, \u201cdid you ever love her, even a little? Or was it just the crown you lusted for?\u201d\n\u201cLust? You dare speak to me of lust?\u201d The king\u2019s mouth twisted in anger. \u201cI lusted for the crown, aye\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not half so much as she lusted for her sellsword. Perhaps it was her precious captain who tried to poison her, for putting him aside. And if I had eaten of his locusts too, well, so much the better.\u201d\n\u201cDaario is a killer but not a poisoner.\u201d Ser Barristan moved closer to the king. \u201cAre you the Harpy?\u201d This time he put his hand on the hilt of his longsword. \u201cTell me true, and I promise you shall have a swift, clean death.\u201d\n\u201cYou presume too much, ser,\u201d said Hizdahr. \u201cI am done with these questions, and with you. You are dismissed from my service. Leave Meereen at once and I will let you live.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are not the Harpy, give me his name.\u201d Ser Barristan pulled his sword from the scabbard. Its sharp edge caught the light from the brazier, became a line of orange fire.\nHizdahr broke. \u201cKhrazz!\u201d he shrieked, stumbling backwards toward his bedchamber. \u201cKhrazz! Khrazz!\u201d\nSer Barristan heard a door open, somewhere to his left. He turned in time to see Khrazz emerge from behind a tapestry. He moved slowly, still groggy from sleep, but his weapon of choice was in his hand: a Dothraki arakh, long and curved. A slasher\u2019s sword, made to deliver deep, slicing cuts from horseback. A murderous blade against half-naked foes, in the pit or on the battlefield. But here at close quarters, the arakh\u2019s length would tell against it, and Barristan Selmy was clad in plate and mail.\n\u201cI am here for Hizdahr,\u201d the knight said. \u201cThrow down your steel and stand aside, and no harm need come to you.\u201d\nKhrazz laughed. \u201cOld man. I will eat your heart.\u201d The two men were of a height, but Khrazz was two stone heavier and forty years younger, with pale skin, dead eyes, and a crest of bristly red-black hair that ran from his brow to the base of his neck.\n\u201cThen come,\u201d said Barristan the Bold.\nKhrazz came.\nFor the first time all day, Selmy felt certain. This is what I was made for, he thought. The dance, the sweet steel song, a sword in my hand and a foe before me.\nThe pit fighter was fast, blazing fast, as quick as any man Ser Barristan had ever fought. In those big hands, the arakh became a whistling blur, a steel storm that seemed to come at the old knight from three directions at once. Most of the cuts were aimed at his head. Khrazz was no fool. Without a helm, Selmy was most vulnerable above the neck.\nHe blocked the blows calmly, his longsword meeting each slash and turning it aside. The blades rang and rang again. Ser Barristan retreated. On the edge of his vision, he saw the cupbearers watching with eyes as big and white as chicken eggs. Khrazz cursed and turned a high cut into a low one, slipping past the old knight\u2019s blade for once, only to have his blow scrape uselessly off a white steel greave. Selmy\u2019s answering slash found the pit fighter\u2019s left shoulder, parting the fine linen to bite the flesh beneath. His yellow tunic began to turn pink, then red.\n\u201cOnly cowards dress in iron,\u201d Khrazz declared, circling. No one wore armor in the fighting pits. It was blood the crowds came for: death, dismemberment, and shrieks of agony, the music of the scarlet sands.\nSer Barristan turned with him. \u201cThis coward is about to kill you, ser.\u201d The man was no knight, but his courage had earned him that much courtesy. Khrazz did not know how to fight a man in armor. Ser Barristan could see it in his eyes: doubt, confusion, the beginnings of fear. The pit fighter came on again, screaming this time, as if sound could slay his foe where steel could not. The arakh slashed low, high, low again.\nSelmy blocked the cuts at his head and let his armor stop the rest, whilst his own blade opened the pit fighter\u2019s cheek from ear to mouth, then traced a raw red gash across his chest. Blood welled from Khrazz\u2019s wounds. That only seemed to make him wilder. He seized the brazier with his off hand and flipped it, scattering embers and hot coals at Selmy\u2019s feet. Ser Barristan leapt over them. Khrazz slashed at his arm and caught him, but the arakh could only chip the hard enamel before it met the steel below.\n\u201cIn the pit that would have taken your arm off, old man.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not in the pit.\u201d\n\u201cTake off that armor!\u201d\n\u201cIt is not too late to throw down your steel. Yield.\u201d\n\u201cDie,\u201d spat Khrazz\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but as he lifted his arakh, its tip grazed one of the wall hangings and hung. That was all the chance Ser Barristan required. He slashed open the pit fighter\u2019s belly, parried the arakh as it wrenched free, then finished Khrazz with a quick thrust to the heart as the pit fighter\u2019s entrails came sliding out like a nest of greasy eels.\nBlood and viscera stained the king\u2019s silk carpets. Selmy took a step back. The longsword in his hand was red for half its length. Here and there the carpets had begun to smolder where some of the scattered coals had fallen. He could hear poor Qezza sobbing. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d the old knight said. \u201cI mean you no harm, child. I want only the king.\u201d\nHe wiped his sword clean on a curtain and stalked into the bedchamber, where he found Hizdahr zo Loraq, Fourteenth of His Noble Name, hiding behind a tapestry and whimpering. \u201cSpare me,\u201d he begged. \u201cI do not want to die.\u201d\n\u201cFew do. Yet all men die, regardless.\u201d Ser Barristan sheathed his sword and pulled Hizdahr to his feet. \u201cCome. I will escort you to a cell.\u201d By now, the Brazen Beasts should have disarmed Steelskin. \u201cYou will be kept a prisoner until the queen returns. If nothing can be proved against you, you will not come to harm. You have my word as a knight.\u201d He took the king\u2019s arm and led him from the bedchamber, feeling strangely light-headed, almost drunk. I was a Kingsguard. What am I now?\nMiklaz and Draqaz had returned with Hizdahr\u2019s wine. They stood in the open door, cradling the flagons against their chests and staring wide-eyed at the corpse of Khrazz. Qezza was still crying, but Jezhene had appeared to comfort her. She hugged the younger girl, stroking her hair. Some of the other cupbearers stood behind them, watching. \u201cYour Worship,\u201d Miklaz said, \u201cthe noble Reznak mo Reznak says to t-tell you, come at once.\u201d\nThe boy addressed the king as if Ser Barristan were not there, as if there were no dead man sprawled upon the carpet, his life\u2019s blood slowly staining the silk red. Skahaz was supposed to take Reznak into custody until we could be certain of his loyalty. Had something gone awry? \u201cCome where?\u201d Ser Barristan asked the boy. \u201cWhere does the seneschal want His Grace to go?\u201d\n\u201cOutside.\u201d Miklaz seemed to see him for the first time. \u201cOutside, ser. To the t-terrace. To see.\u201d\n\u201cTo see what?\u201d\n\u201cD-d-dragons. The dragons have been loosed, ser.\u201d\nSeven save us all, the old knight thought.",

      "content": "THE DRAGONTAMER\nThe night crept past on slow black feet. The hour of the bat gave way to the hour of the eel, the hour of the eel to the hour of ghosts. The prince lay abed, staring at his ceiling, dreaming without sleeping, remembering, imagining, twisting beneath his linen coverlet, his mind feverish with thoughts of fire and blood.\nFinally, despairing of rest, Quentyn Martell made his way to his solar, where he poured himself a cup of wine and drank it in the dark. The taste was sweet solace on his tongue, so he lit a candle and poured himself another. Wine will help me sleep, he told himself, but he knew that was a lie.\nHe stared at the candle for a long time, then put down his cup and held his palm above the flame. It took every bit of will he had to lower it until the fire touched his flesh, and when it did he snatched his hand back with a cry of pain.\n\u201cQuentyn, are you mad?\u201d\nNo, just scared. I do not want to burn. \u201cGerris?\u201d\n\u201cI heard you moving about.\u201d\n\u201cI could not sleep.\u201d\n\u201cAre burns a cure for that? Some warm milk and a lullaby might serve you well. Or better still, I could take you to the Temple of the Graces and find a girl for you.\u201d\n\u201cA whore, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cThey call them Graces. They come in different colors. The red ones are the only ones who fuck.\u201d Gerris seated himself across the table. \u201cThe septas back home should take up the custom, if you ask me. Have you noticed that old septas always look like prunes? That\u2019s what a life of chastity will do to you.\u201d\nQuentyn glanced out at the terrace, where night\u2019s shadows lay thick amongst the trees. He could hear the soft sound of falling water. \u201cIs that rain? Your whores will be gone.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of them. There are little snuggeries in the pleasure gardens, and they wait there every night until a man chooses them. Those who are not chosen must remain until the sun comes up, feeling lonely and neglected. We could console them.\u201d\n\u201cThey could console me, is what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cThat too.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the sort of consolation I require.\u201d\n\u201cI disagree. Daenerys Targaryen is not the only woman in the world. Do you want to die a man-maid?\u201d\nQuentyn did not want to die at all. I want to go back to Yronwood and kiss both of your sisters, marry Gwyneth Yronwood, watch her flower into beauty, have a child by her. I want to ride in tourneys, hawk and hunt, visit with my mother in Norvos, read some of those books my father sends me. I want Cletus and Will and Maester Kedry to be alive again. \u201cDo you think Daenerys would be pleased to hear that I had bedded some whore?\u201d\n\u201cShe might be. Men may be fond of maidens, but women like a man who knows what he\u2019s about in the bedchamber. It\u2019s another sort of swordplay. Takes training to be good at it.\u201d\nThe gibe stung. Quentyn had never felt so much a boy as when he\u2019d stood before Daenerys Targaryen, pleading for her hand. The thought of bedding her terrified him almost as much as her dragons had. What if he could not please her? \u201cDaenerys has a paramour,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cMy father did not send me here to amuse the queen in the bedchamber. You know why we have come.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot marry her. She has a husband.\u201d\n\u201cShe does not love Hizdahr zo Loraq.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has love to do with marriage? A prince should know better. Your father married for love, it\u2019s said. How much joy has he had of that?\u201d\nLittle and less. Doran Martell and his Norvoshi wife had spent half their marriage apart and the other half arguing. It was the only rash thing his father had ever done, to hear some tell it, the only time he had followed his heart instead of his head, and he had lived to rue it. \u201cNot all risks lead to ruin,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis is my duty. My destiny.\u201d You are supposed to be my friend, Gerris. Why must you mock my hopes? I have doubts enough without your throwing oil on the fire of my fear. \u201cThis will be my grand adventure.\u201d\n\u201cMen die on grand adventures.\u201d\nHe was not wrong. That was in the stories too. The hero sets out with his friends and companions, faces dangers, comes home triumphant. Only some of his companions don\u2019t return at all. The hero never dies, though. I must be the hero. \u201cAll I need is courage. Would you have Dorne remember me as a failure?\u201d\n\u201cDorne is not like to remember any of us for long.\u201d\nQuentyn sucked at the burned spot on his palm. \u201cDorne remembers Aegon and his sisters. Dragons are not so easily forgotten. They will remember Daenerys as well.\u201d\n\u201cNot if she\u2019s died.\u201d\n\u201cShe lives.\u201d She must. \u201cShe is lost, but I can find her.\u201d And when I do, she will look at me the way she looks at her sellsword. Once I have proven myself worthy of her.\n\u201cFrom dragonback?\u201d\n\u201cI have been riding horses since I was six years old.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been thrown a time or three.\u201d\n\u201cThat never stopped me from getting back into the saddle.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been thrown off a thousand feet above the ground,\u201d Gerris pointed out. \u201cAnd horses seldom turn their riders into charred bones and ashes.\u201d\nI know the dangers. \u201cI\u2019ll hear no more of this. You have my leave to go. Find a ship and run home, Gerris.\u201d The prince rose, blew the candle out, and crept back to his bed and its sweat-soaked linen sheets. I should have kissed one of the Drinkwater twins, or maybe both of them. I should have kissed them whilst I could. I should have gone to Norvos to see my mother and the place that gave her birth, so she would know that I had not forgotten her. He could hear the rain falling outside, drumming against the bricks.\nBy the time the hour of the wolf crept upon them, the rain was falling steadily, slashing down in a hard, cold torrent that would soon turn the brick streets of Meereen into rivers. The three Dornishmen broke their fast in the predawn chill\u2014a simple meal of fruit and bread and cheese, washed down with goat milk. When Gerris made to pour himself a cup of wine, Quentyn stopped him. \u201cNo wine. There will be time enough for drink afterward.\u201d\n\u201cOne hopes,\u201d said Gerris.\nThe big man looked out toward the terrace. \u201cI knew it would rain,\u201d he said in a gloomy tone. \u201cMy bones were aching last night. They always ache before it rains. The dragons won\u2019t like this. Fire and water don\u2019t mix, and that\u2019s a fact. You get a good cookfire lit, blazing away nice, then it starts to piss down rain and next thing your wood is sodden and your flames are dead.\u201d\nGerris chuckled. \u201cDragons are not made of wood, Arch.\u201d\n\u201cSome are. That old King Aegon, the randy one, he built wooden dragons to conquer us. That ended bad, though.\u201d\nSo may this, the prince thought. The follies and failures of Aegon the Unworthy did not concern him, but he was full of doubts and misgivings. The labored banter of his friends was only making his head ache. They do not understand. They may be Dornish, but I am Dorne. Years from now, when I am dead, this will be the song they sing of me. He rose abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\nHis friends got to their feet. Ser Archibald drained the last of his goat\u2019s milk and wiped the milk mustache from his upper lip with the back of a big hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get our mummer\u2019s garb.\u201d\nHe returned with the bundle that they had collected from the Tattered Prince at their second meeting. Within were three long hooded cloaks made from myriad small squares of cloth sewn together, three cudgels, three shortswords, three masks of polished brass. A bull, a lion, and an ape.\nEverything required to be a Brazen Beast.\n\u201cThey may ask for a word,\u201d the Tattered Prince had warned them when he handed over the bundle. \u201cIt\u2019s dog.\u201d\n\u201cYou are certain of that?\u201d Gerris had asked him.\n\u201cCertain enough to wager a life upon it.\u201d\nThe prince did not mistake his meaning. \u201cMy life.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be the one.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you learn their word?\u201d\n\u201cWe chanced upon some Brazen Beasts and Meris asked them prettily. But a prince should know better than to pose such questions, Dornish. In Pentos, we have a saying. Never ask the baker what went into the pie. Just eat.\u201d\nJust eat. There was wisdom in that, Quentyn supposed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the bull,\u201d Arch announced.\nQuentyn handed him the bull mask. \u201cThe lion for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhich makes a monkey out of me.\u201d Gerris pressed the ape mask to his face. \u201cHow do they breathe in these things?\u201d\n\u201cJust put it on.\u201d The prince was in no mood for japes.\nThe bundle contained a whip as well\u2014a nasty piece of old leather with a handle of brass and bone, stout enough to peel the hide off an ox. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Arch asked.\n\u201cDaenerys used a whip to cow the black beast.\u201d Quentyn coiled the whip and hung it from his belt. \u201cArch, bring your hammer as well. We may have need of it.\u201d\nIt was no easy thing to enter the Great Pyramid of Meereen by night. The doors were closed and barred each day at sunset and remained closed until first light. Guards were posted at every entrance, and more guards patrolled the lowest terrace, where they could look down on the street. Formerly those guards had been Unsullied. Now they were Brazen Beasts. And that would make all the difference, Quentyn hoped.\nThe watch changed when the sun came up, but dawn was still half an hour off as the three Dornishmen made their way down the servants\u2019 steps. The walls around them were made of bricks of half a hundred colors, but the shadows turned them all to grey until touched by the light of the torch that Gerris carried. They encountered no one on the long descent. The only sound was the scuff of their boots on the worn bricks beneath their feet.\nThe pyramid\u2019s main gates fronted on Meereen\u2019s central plaza, but the Dornishmen made their way to a side entrance opening on an alley. These were the gates that slaves had used in former days as they went about their masters\u2019 business, where smallfolk and tradesmen came and went and made their deliveries.\nThe doors were solid bronze, closed with a heavy iron bar. Before them stood two Brazen Beasts, armed with cudgels, spears, and short swords. Torchlight glimmered off the polished brass of their masks\u2014a rat and a fox. Quentyn gestured for the big man to stay back in the shadows. He and Gerris strode forward together.\n\u201cYou come early,\u201d the fox said.\nQuentyn shrugged. \u201cWe can leave again, if you like. You\u2019re welcome to stand our watch.\u201d He sounded not at all Ghiscari, he knew; but half the Brazen Beasts were freed slaves, with all manner of native tongues, so his accent went unremarked.\n\u201cBugger that,\u201d the rat remarked.\n\u201cGive us the day\u2019s word,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cDog,\u201d said the Dornishman.\nThe two Brazen Beasts exchanged a look. For three long heartbeats Quentyn was afraid that something had gone amiss, that somehow Pretty Meris and the Tattered Prince had gotten the word wrong. Then the fox grunted. \u201cDog, then,\u201d he said. \u201cThe door is yours.\u201d As they moved off, the prince began to breathe again.\nThey did not have long. The real relief would doubtless turn up shortly. \u201cArch,\u201d he called, and the big man appeared, the torchlight shining off his bull\u2019s mask. \u201cThe bar. Hurry.\u201d\nThe iron bar was thick and heavy, but well oiled. Ser Archibald had no trouble lifting it. As he was standing it on end, Quentyn pulled the doors open and Gerris stepped through, waving the torch. \u201cBring it in now. Be quick about it.\u201d\nThe butcher\u2019s wagon was outside, waiting in the alley. The driver gave the mule a lick and rumbled through, iron-rimmed wheels clacking loudly over bricks. The quartered carcass of an ox filled the wagon bed, along with two dead sheep. Half a dozen men entered afoot. Five wore the cloaks and masks of Brazen Beasts, but Pretty Meris had not troubled to disguise herself. \u201cWhere is your lord?\u201d he asked Meris.\n\u201cI have no lord,\u201d she answered. \u201cIf you mean your fellow prince, he is near, with fifty men. Bring your dragon out, and he will see you safe away, as promised. Caggo commands here.\u201d\nSer Archibald was giving the butcher\u2019s wagon the sour eye. \u201cWill that cart be big enough to hold a dragon?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cShould. It\u2019s held two oxen.\u201d The Corpsekiller was garbed as a Brazen Beast, his seamed, scarred face hidden behind a cobra mask, but the familiar black arakh slung at his hip gave him away. \u201cWe were told these beasts are smaller than the queen\u2019s monster.\u201d\n\u201cThe pit has slowed their growth.\u201d Quentyn\u2019s readings had suggested that the same thing had occurred in the Seven Kingdoms. None of the dragons bred and raised in the Dragonpit of King\u2019s Landing had ever approached the size of Vhagar or Meraxes, much less that of the Black Dread, King Aegon\u2019s monster. \u201cHave you brought sufficient chains?\u201d\n\u201cHow many dragons do you have?\u201d said Pretty Meris. \u201cWe have chains enough for ten, concealed beneath the meat.\u201d\n\u201cVery good.\u201d Quentyn felt light-headed. None of this seemed quite real. One moment it felt like a game, the next like some nightmare, like a bad dream where he found himself opening a dark door, knowing that horror and death waited on the other side, yet somehow powerless to stop himself. His palms were slick with sweat. He wiped them on his legs and said, \u201cThere will be more guards outside the pit.\u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d said Gerris.\n\u201cWe need to be ready for them.\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d said Arch.\nThere was a cramp in Quentyn\u2019s belly. He felt a sudden need to move his bowels, but knew he dare not beg off now. \u201cThis way, then.\u201d He had seldom felt more like a boy. Yet they followed; Gerris and the big man, Meris and Caggo and the other Windblown. Two of the sellswords had produced crossbows from some hiding place within the wagon.\nBeyond the stables, the ground level of the Great Pyramid became a labyrinth, but Quentyn Martell had been through here with the queen, and he remembered the way. Under three huge brick arches they went, then down a steep stone ramp into the depths, through the dungeons and torture chambers and past a pair of deep stone cisterns. Their footsteps echoed hollowly off the walls, the butcher\u2019s cart rumbling behind them. The big man snatched a torch down from a wall sconce to lead the way.\nAt last a pair of heavy iron doors rose before them, rust-eaten and forbidding, closed with a length of chain whose every link was as thick around as a man\u2019s arm. The size and thickness of those doors was enough to make Quentyn Martell question the wisdom of this course. Even worse, both doors were plainly dinted by something inside trying to get out. The thick iron was cracked and splitting in three places, and the upper corner of the left-hand door looked partly melted.\nFour Brazen Beasts stood guarding the door. Three held long spears; the fourth, the serjeant, was armed with short sword and dagger. His mask was wrought in the shape of a basilisk\u2019s head. The other three were masked as insects.\nLocusts, Quentyn realized. \u201cDog,\u201d he said.\nThe serjeant stiffened.\nThat was all it took for Quentyn Martell to realize that something had gone awry. \u201cTake them,\u201d he croaked, even as the basilisk\u2019s hand darted for his shortsword.\nHe was quick, that serjeant. The big man was quicker. He flung the torch at the nearest locust, reached back, and unslung his warhammer. The basilisk\u2019s blade had scarce slipped from its leather sheath when the hammer\u2019s spike slammed into his temple, crunching through the thin brass of his mask and the flesh and bone beneath. The serjeant staggered sideways half a step before his knees folded under him and he sank down to the floor, his whole body shaking grotesquely.\nQuentyn stared transfixed, his belly roiling. His own blade was still in its sheath. He had not so much as reached for it. His eyes were locked on the serjeant dying before him, jerking. The fallen torch was on the floor, guttering, making every shadow leap and twist in a monstrous mockery of the dead man\u2019s shaking. The prince never saw the locust\u2019s spear coming toward him until Gerris slammed into him, knocking him aside. The spearpoint grazed the cheek of the lion\u2019s head he wore. Even then the blow was so violent it almost tore the mask off. It would have gone right through my throat, the prince thought, dazed.\nGerris cursed as the locusts closed around him. Quentyn heard the sound of running feet. Then the sellswords came rushing from the shadows. One of the guards glanced at them just long enough for Gerris to get inside his spear. He drove the point of his sword under the brass mask and up through the wearer\u2019s throat, even as the second locust sprouted a crossbow bolt from his chest.\nThe last locust dropped his spear. \u201cYield. I yield.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You die.\u201d Caggo took the man\u2019s head off with one swipe of his arakh, the Valyrian steel shearing through flesh and bone and gristle as if they were so much suet. \u201cToo much noise,\u201d he complained. \u201cAny man with ears will have heard.\u201d\n\u201cDog,\u201d Quentyn said. \u201cThe day\u2019s word was supposed to be dog. Why wouldn\u2019t they let us pass? We were told\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were told your scheme was madness, have you forgotten?\u201d said Pretty Meris. \u201cDo what you came to do.\u201d\nThe dragons, Prince Quentyn thought. Yes. We came for the dragons. He felt as though he might be sick. What am I doing here? Father, why? Four men dead in as many heartbeats, and for what? \u201cFire and blood,\u201d he whispered, \u201cblood and fire.\u201d The blood was pooling at his feet, soaking into the brick floor. The fire was beyond those doors. \u201cThe chains\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we have no key\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nArch said, \u201cI have the key.\u201d He swung his warhammer hard and fast. Sparks flew when the hammmerhead struck the lock. And then again, again, again. On his fifth swing the lock shattered, and the chains fell away in a rattling clatter so loud Quentyn was certain half the pyramid must have heard them. \u201cBring the cart.\u201d The dragons would be more docile once fed. Let them gorge themselves on charred mutton.\nArchibald Yronwood grasped the iron doors and pulled them apart. Their rusted hinges let out a pair of screams, for all those who might have slept through the breaking of the lock. A wash of sudden heat assaulted them, heavy with the odors of ash, brimstone, and burnt meat.\nIt was black beyond the doors, a sullen stygian darkness that seemed alive and threatening, hungry. Quentyn could sense that there was something in that darkness, coiled and waiting. Warrior, grant me courage, he prayed. He did not want to do this, but he saw no other way. Why else would Daenerys have shown me the dragons? She wants me to prove myself to her. Gerris handed him a torch. He stepped through the doors.\nThe green one is Rhaegal, the white Viserion, he reminded himself. Use their names, command them, speak to them calmly but sternly. Master them, as Daenerys mastered Drogon in the pit. The girl had been alone, clad in wisps of silk, but fearless. I must not be afraid. She did it, so can I. The main thing was to show no fear. Animals can smell fear, and dragons\u00a0\u2026 What did he know of dragons? What does any man know of dragons? They have been gone from the world for more than a century.\nThe lip of the pit was just ahead. Quentyn edged forward slowly, moving the torch from side to side. Walls and floor and ceiling drank the light. Scorched, he realized. Bricks burned black, crumbling into ash. The air grew warmer with every step he took. He began to sweat.\nTwo eyes rose up before him.\nBronze, they were, brighter than polished shields, glowing with their own heat, burning behind a veil of smoke rising from the dragon\u2019s nostrils. The light of Quentyn\u2019s torch washed over scales of dark green, the green of moss in the deep woods at dusk, just before the last light fades. Then the dragon opened its mouth, and light and heat washed over them. Behind a fence of sharp black teeth he glimpsed the furnace glow, the shimmer of a sleeping fire a hundred times brighter than his torch. The dragon\u2019s head was larger than a horse\u2019s, and the neck stretched on and on, uncoiling like some great green serpent as the head rose, until those two glowing bronze eyes were staring down at him.\nGreen, the prince thought, his scales are green. \u201cRhaegal,\u201d he said. His voice caught in his throat, and what came out was a broken croak. Frog, he thought, I am turning into Frog again. \u201cThe food,\u201d he croaked, remembering. \u201cBring the food.\u201d\nThe big man heard him. Arch wrestled one of the sheep off the wagon by two legs, then spun and flung it into the pit.\nRhaegal took it in the air. His head snapped round, and from between his jaws a lance of flame erupted, a swirling storm of orange-and-yellow fire shot through with veins of green. The sheep was burning before it began to fall. Before the smoking carcass could strike the bricks, the dragon\u2019s teeth closed round it. A nimbus of flames still flickered about the body. The air stank of burning wool and brimstone. Dragonstink.\n\u201cI thought there were two,\u201d the big man said.\nViserion. Yes. Where is Viserion? The prince lowered his torch to throw some light into the gloom below. He could see the green dragon ripping at the smoking carcass of the sheep, his long tail lashing from side to side as he ate. A thick iron collar was visible about his neck, with three feet of broken chain dangling from it. Shattered links were strewn across the floor of the pit amongst the blackened bones\u2014twists of metal, partly melted. Rhaegal was chained to the wall and floor the last time I was here, the prince recalled, but Viserion hung from the ceiling. Quentyn stepped back, lifted the torch, craned his head back.\nFor a moment he saw only the blackened arches of the bricks above, scorched by dragonflame. A trickle of ash caught his eye, betraying movement. Something pale, half-hidden, stirring. He\u2019s made himself a cave, the prince realized. A burrow in the brick. The foundations of the Great Pyramid of Meereen were massive and thick to support the weight of the huge structure overhead; even the interior walls were three times thicker than any castle\u2019s curtain walls. But Viserion had dug himself a hole in them with flame and claw, a hole big enough to sleep in.\nAnd we\u2019ve just woken him. He could see what looked like some huge white serpent uncoiling inside the wall, up where it curved to become the ceiling. More ash went drifting downward, and a bit of crumbling brick fell away. The serpent resolved itself into a neck and tail, and then the dragon\u2019s long horned head appeared, his eyes glowing in the dark like golden coals. His wings rattled, stretching.\nAll of Quentyn\u2019s plans had fled his head. He could hear Caggo Corpsekiller shouting to his sellswords. The chains, he is sending for the chains, the Dornish prince thought. The plan had been to feed the beasts and chain them in their torpor, just as the queen had done. One dragon, or preferably both.\n\u201cMore meat,\u201d Quentyn said. Once the beasts were fed they will become sluggish. He had seen it work with snakes in Dorne, but here, with these monsters\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cBring\u00a0\u2026\u00a0bring\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nViserion launched himself from the ceiling, pale leather wings unfolding, spreading wide. The broken chain dangling from his neck swung wildly. His flame lit the pit, pale gold shot through with red and orange, and the stale air exploded in a cloud of hot ash and sulfur as the white wings beat and beat again.\nA hand seized Quentyn by the shoulder. The torch spun from his grip to bounce across the floor, then tumbled into the pit, still burning. He found himself face-to-face with a brass ape. Gerris. \u201cQuent, this will not work. They are too wild, they\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThe dragon came down between the Dornishmen and the door with a roar that would have sent a hundred lions running. His head moved side to side as he inspected the intruders\u2014Dornishmen, Windblown, Caggo. Last and longest the beast stared at Pretty Meris, sniffing. The woman, Quentyn realized. He knows that she is female. He is looking for Daenerys. He wants his mother and does not understand why she\u2019s not here.\nQuentyn wrenched free of Gerris\u2019s grip. \u201cViserion,\u201d he called. The white one is Viserion. For half a heartbeat he was afraid he\u2019d gotten it wrong. \u201cViserion,\u201d he called again, fumbling for the whip hanging from his belt. She cowed the black one with a whip. I need to do the same.\nThe dragon knew his name. His head turned, and his gaze lingered on the Dornish prince for three long heartbeats. Pale fires burned behind the shining black daggers of his teeth. His eyes were lakes of molten gold, and smoke rose from his nostrils.\n\u201cDown,\u201d Quentyn said. Then he coughed, and coughed again.\nThe air was thick with smoke and the sulfur stench was choking.\nViserion lost interest. The dragon turned back toward the Windblown and lurched toward the door. Perhaps he could smell the blood of the dead guards or the meat in the butcher\u2019s wagon. Or perhaps he had only now seen that the way was open.\nQuentyn heard the sellswords shouting. Caggo was calling for the chains, and Pretty Meris was screaming at someone to step aside. The dragon moved awkwardly on the ground, like a man scrabbling on his knees and elbows, but quicker than the Dornish prince would have believed. When the Windblown were too late to get out of his way, Viserion let loose with another roar. Quentyn heard the rattle of chains, the deep thrum of a crossbow.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he screamed, \u201cno, don\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u201d but it was too late. The fool was all that he had time to think as the quarrel caromed off Viserion\u2019s neck to vanish in the gloom. A line of fire gleamed in its wake\u2014dragon\u2019s blood, glowing gold and red.\nThe crossbowman was fumbling for another quarrel as the dragon\u2019s teeth closed around his neck. The man wore the mask of a Brazen Beast, the fearsome likeness of a tiger. As he dropped his weapon to try and pry apart Viserion\u2019s jaws, flame gouted from the tiger\u2019s mouth. The man\u2019s eyes burst with soft popping sounds, and the brass around them began to run. The dragon tore off a hunk of flesh, most of the sellsword\u2019s neck, then gulped it down as the burning corpse collapsed to the floor.\nThe other Windblown were pulling back. This was more than even Pretty Meris had the stomach for. Viserion\u2019s horned head moved back and forth between them and his prey, but after a moment he forgot the sellswords and bent his neck to tear another mouthful from the dead man. A lower leg this time.\nQuentyn let his whip uncoil. \u201cViserion,\u201d he called, louder this time. He could do this, he would do this, his father had sent him to the far ends of the earth for this, he would not fail him. \u201cVISERION!\u201d He snapped the whip in the air with a crack that echoed off the blackened walls.\nThe pale head rose. The great gold eyes narrowed. Wisps of smoke spiraled upward from the dragon\u2019s nostrils.\n\u201cDown,\u201d the prince commanded. You must not let him smell your fear. \u201cDown, down, down.\u201d He brought the whip around and laid a lash across the dragon\u2019s face. Viserion hissed.\nAnd then a hot wind buffeted him and he heard the sound of leathern wings and the air was full of ash and cinders and a monstrous roar went echoing off the scorched and blackened bricks and he could hear his friends shouting wildly. Gerris was calling out his name, over and over, and the big man was bellowing, \u201cBehind you, behind you, behind you!\u201d\nQuentyn turned and threw his left arm across his face to shield his eyes from the furnace wind. Rhaegal, he reminded himself, the green one is Rhaegal.\nWhen he raised his whip, he saw that the lash was burning. His hand as well. All of him, all of him was burning.\nOh, he thought. Then he began to scream.",

      "content": "JON\nLet them die,\u201d said Queen Selyse.\nIt was the answer that Jon Snow had expected. This queen never fails to disappoint. Somehow that did not soften the blow. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he persisted stubbornly, \u201cthey are starving at Hardhome by the thousands. Many are women\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and children, yes. Very sad.\u201d The queen pulled her daughter closer to her and kissed her cheek. The cheek unmarred by greyscale, Jon did not fail to note. \u201cWe are sorry for the little ones, of course, but we must be sensible. We have no food for them, and they are too young to help the king my husband in his wars. Better that they be reborn into the light.\u201d\nThat was just a softer way of saying let them die.\nThe chamber was crowded. Princess Shireen stood beside her mother\u2019s seat, with Patchface cross-legged at her feet. Behind the queen loomed Ser Axell Florent. Melisandre of Asshai stood closer to the fire, the ruby at her throat pulsing with every breath she took. The red woman too had her attendants\u2014the squire Devan Seaworth and two of the guardsmen the king had left her.\nQueen Selyse\u2019s protectors stood along the walls, shining knights all in a row: Ser Malegorn, Ser Benethon, Ser Narbert, Ser Patrek, Ser Dorden, Ser Brus. With so many bloodthirsty wildlings infesting Castle Black, Selyse kept her sworn shields about her night and day. Tormund Giantsbane had roared to hear it. \u201cAfraid of being carried off, is she? I hope you never said how big me member is, Jon Snow, that\u2019d frighten any woman. I always wanted me one with a mustache.\u201d Then he laughed and laughed.\nHe would not be laughing now.\nJon had wasted enough time here. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have troubled Your Grace. The Night\u2019s Watch will attend to this matter.\u201d\nThe queen\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cYou still mean to ride to Hardhome. I see it on your face. Let them die, I said, yet you will persist in this mad folly. Do not deny it.\u201d\n\u201cI must do as I think best. With respect, Your Grace, the Wall is mine, and so is this decision.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Selyse allowed, \u201cand you will answer for it when the king returns. And for other decisions you have made, I fear. But I see that you are deaf to sense. Do what you must.\u201d\nUp spoke Ser Malegorn. \u201cLord Snow, who will lead this ranging?\u201d\n\u201cAre you offering yourself, ser?\u201d\n\u201cDo I look so foolish?\u201d\nPatchface jumped up. \u201cI will lead it!\u201d His bells rang merrily. \u201cWe will march into the sea and out again. Under the waves we will ride seahorses, and mermaids will blow seashells to announce our coming, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nThey all laughed. Even Queen Selyse allowed herself a thin smile. Jon was less amused. \u201cI will not ask my men to do what I would not do myself. I mean to lead the ranging.\u201d\n\u201cHow bold of you,\u201d said the queen. \u201cWe approve. Afterward some bard will make a stirring song about you, no doubt, and we shall have a more prudent lord commander.\u201d She took a sip of wine. \u201cLet us speak of other matters. Axell, bring in the wildling king, if you would be so good.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Grace.\u201d Ser Axell went through a door and returned a moment later with Gerrick Kingsblood. \u201cGerrick of House Redbeard,\u201d he announced, \u201cKing of the Wildlings.\u201d\nGerrick Kingsblood was a tall man, long of leg and broad of shoulder. The queen had dressed him in some of the king\u2019s old clothes, it appeared. Scrubbed and groomed, clad in green velvets and an ermine half-cape, with his long red hair freshly washed and his fiery beard shaped and trimmed, the wildling looked every inch a southron lord. He could walk into the throne room at King\u2019s Landing, and no one would blink an eye, Jon thought.\n\u201cGerrick is the true and rightful king of the wildlings,\u201d the queen said, \u201cdescended in an unbroken male line from their great king Raymun Redbeard, whereas the usurper Mance Rayder was born of some common woman and fathered by one of your black brothers.\u201d\nNo, Jon might have said, Gerrick is descended from a younger brother of Raymun Redbeard. To the free folk that counted about as much as being descended from Raymun Redbeard\u2019s horse. They know nothing, Ygritte. And worse, they will not learn.\n\u201cGerrick has graciously agreed to give the hand of his eldest daughter to my beloved Axell, to be united by the Lord of Light in holy wedlock,\u201d Queen Selyse said. \u201cHis other girls shall wed at the same time\u2014the second daughter with Ser Brus Buckler and the youngest with Ser Malegorn of Redpool.\u201d\n\u201cSers.\u201d Jon inclined his head to the knights in question. \u201cMay you find happiness with your betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the sea, men marry fishes.\u201d Patchface did a little dance step, jingling his bells. \u201cThey do, they do, they do.\u201d\nQueen Selyse sniffed again. \u201cFour marriages can be made as simply as three. It is past time that this woman Val was settled, Lord Snow. I have decided that she shall wed my good and leal knight, Ser Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain.\u201d\n\u201cHas Val been told, Your Grace?\u201d asked Jon. \u201cAmongst the free folk, when a man desires a woman, he steals her, and thus proves his strength, his cunning, and his courage. The suitor risks a savage beating if he is caught by the woman\u2019s kin, and worse than that if she herself finds him unworthy.\u201d\n\u201cA savage custom,\u201d Axell Florent said.\nSer Patrek only chuckled. \u201cNo man has ever had cause to question my courage. No woman ever will.\u201d\nQueen Selyse pursed her lips. \u201cLord Snow, as Lady Val is a stranger to our ways, please send her to me, that I might instruct her in the duties of a noble lady toward her lord husband.\u201d\nThat will go splendidly, I know. Jon wondered if the queen would be so eager to see Val married to one of her own knights if she knew Val\u2019s feelings about Princess Shireen. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said, \u201cthough if I might speak freely\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think not. You may take your leave of us.\u201d\nJon Snow bent his knee, bowed his head, withdrew.\nHe took the steps two at a time, nodding to the queen\u2019s guards as he descended. Her Grace had posted men on every landing to keep her safe from murderous wildlings. Halfway down, a voice called out from above him. \u201cJon Snow.\u201d\nJon turned. \u201cLady Melisandre.\u201d\n\u201cWe must speak.\u201d\n\u201cMust we?\u201d I think not. \u201cMy lady, I have duties.\u201d\n\u201cIt is those duties I would speak of.\u201d She made her way down, the hem of her scarlet skirts swishing over the steps. It almost seemed as if she floated. \u201cWhere is your direwolf?\u201d\n\u201cAsleep in my chambers. Her Grace does not allow Ghost in her presence. She claims he scares the princess. And so long as Borroq and his boar are about, I dare not let him loose.\u201d The skinchanger was to accompany Soren Shieldbreaker to Stonedoor once the wayns carrying the Sealskinner\u2019s clan to Greenguard returned. Until such time, Borroq had taken up residence in one of the ancient tombs beside the castle lichyard. The company of men long dead seemed to suit him better than that of the living, and his boar seemed happy rooting amongst the graves, well away from other animals. \u201cThat thing is the size of a bull, with tusks as long as swords. Ghost would go after him if he were loose, and one or both of them would not survive the meeting.\u201d\n\u201cBorroq is the least of your concerns. This ranging\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA word from you might have swayed the queen.\u201d\n\u201cSelyse has the right of this, Lord Snow. Let them die. You cannot save them. Your ships are lost\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSix remain. More than half the fleet.\u201d\n\u201cYour ships are lost. All of them. Not a man shall return. I have seen that in my fires.\u201d\n\u201cYour fires have been known to lie.\u201d\n\u201cI have made mistakes, I have admitted as much, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA grey girl on a dying horse. Daggers in the dark. A promised prince, born in smoke and salt. It seems to me that you make nothing but mistakes, my lady. Where is Stannis? What of Rattleshirt and his spearwives? Where is my sister?\u201d\n\u201cAll your questions shall be answered. Look to the skies, Lord Snow. And when you have your answers, send to me. Winter is almost upon us now. I am your only hope.\u201d\n\u201cA fool\u2019s hope.\u201d Jon turned and left her.\nLeathers was prowling the yard outside. \u201cToregg has returned,\u201d he reported when Jon emerged. \u201cHis father\u2019s settled his people at Oakenshield and will be back this afternoon with eighty fighting men. What did the bearded queen have to say?\u201d\n\u201cHer Grace can provide no help.\u201d\n\u201cToo busy plucking out her chin hairs, is she?\u201d Leathers spat. \u201cMakes no matter. Tormund\u2019s men and ours will be enough.\u201d\nEnough to get us there, perhaps. It was the journey back that concerned Jon Snow. Coming home, they would be slowed by thousands of free folk, many sick and starved. A river of humanity moving slower than a river of ice. That would leave them vulnerable. Dead things in the woods. Dead things in the water. \u201cHow many men are enough?\u201d he asked Leathers. \u201cA hundred? Two hundred? Five hundred? A thousand?\u201d Should I take more men, or fewer? A smaller ranging would reach Hardhome sooner\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but what good were swords without food? Mother Mole and her people were already at the point of eating their own dead. To feed them, he would need to bring carts and wagons, and draft animals to haul them\u2014horses, oxen, dogs. Instead of flying through the wood, they would be condemned to crawl. \u201cThere is still much to decide. Spread the word. I want all the leading men in the Shieldhall when the evening watch begins. Tormund should be back by then. Where can I find Toregg?\u201d\n\u201cWith the little monster, like as not. He\u2019s taken a liking to one o\u2019 them milkmaids, I hear.\u201d\nHe has taken a liking to Val. Her sister was a queen, why not her? Tormund had once thought to make himself the King-Beyond-the-Wall, before Mance had bested him. Toregg the Tall might well be dreaming the same dream. Better him than Gerrick Kingsblood. \u201cLet them be,\u201d said Jon. \u201cI can speak with Toregg later.\u201d He glanced up past the King\u2019s Tower. The Wall was a dull white, the sky above it whiter. A snow sky. \u201cJust pray we do not get another storm.\u201d\nOutside the armory, Mully and the Flea stood shivering at guard. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be inside, out of this wind?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019d be sweet, m\u2019lord,\u201d said Fulk the Flea, \u201cbut your wolf\u2019s in no mood for company today.\u201d\nMully agreed. \u201cHe tried to take a bite o\u2019 me, he did.\u201d\n\u201cGhost?\u201d Jon was shocked.\n\u201cUnless your lordship has some other white wolf, aye. I never seen him like this, m\u2019lord. All wild-like, I mean.\u201d\nHe was not wrong, as Jon discovered for himself when he slipped inside the doors. The big white direwolf would not lie still. He paced from one end of the armory to the other, past the cold forge and back again. \u201cEasy, Ghost,\u201d Jon called. \u201cDown. Sit, Ghost. Down.\u201d Yet when he made to touch him, the wolf bristled and bared his teeth. It\u2019s that bloody boar. Even in here, Ghost can smell his stink.\nMormont\u2019s raven seemed agitated too. \u201cSnow,\u201d the bird kept screaming. \u201cSnow, snow, snow.\u201d Jon shooed him off, had Satin start a fire, then sent him out after Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck. \u201cBring a flagon of mulled wine as well.\u201d\n\u201cThree cups, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cSix. Mully and the Flea look in need of something warm. So will you.\u201d\nWhen Satin left, Jon seated himself and had another look at the maps of the lands north of the Wall. The fastest way to Hardhome was along the coast\u00a0\u2026\u00a0from Eastwatch. The woods were thinner near the sea, the terrain mostly flatlands, rolling hills, and salt marshes. And when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow. The giants are at Eastwatch, and Leathers says that some will help. From Castle Black the way was more difficult, right through the heart of the haunted forest. If the snow is this deep at the Wall, how much worse up there?\nMarsh entered snuffling, Yarwyck dour. \u201cAnother storm,\u201d the First Builder announced. \u201cHow are we to work in this? I need more builders.\u201d\n\u201cUse the free folk,\u201d Jon said.\nYarwyck shook his head. \u201cMore trouble than they\u2019re worth, that lot. Sloppy, careless, lazy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0some good woodworkers here and there, I\u2019ll not deny it, but hardly a mason amongst them, and nary a smith. Strong backs, might be, but they won\u2019t do as they are told. And us with all these ruins to turn back into forts. Can\u2019t be done, my lord. I tell you true. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be done,\u201d said Jon, \u201cor they will live in ruins.\u201d\nA lord needed men about him he could rely upon for honest counsel. Marsh and Yarwyck were no lickspittles, and that was to the good\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but they were seldom any help either. More and more, he found he knew what they would say before he asked them.\nEspecially when it concerned the free folk, where their disapproval went bone deep. When Jon settled Stonedoor on Soren Shieldbreaker, Yarwyck complained that it was too isolated. How could they know what mischief Soren might get up to, off in those hills? When he conferred Oakenshield on Tormund Giantsbane and Queensgate on Morna White Mask, Marsh pointed out that Castle Black would now have foes on either side who could easily cut them off from the rest of the Wall. As for Borroq, Othell Yarwyck claimed the woods north of Stonedoor were full of wild boars. Who was to say the skinchanger would not make his own pig army?\nHoarfrost Hill and Rimegate still lacked garrisons, so Jon had asked their views on which of the remaining wildling chiefs and war lords might be best suited to hold them. \u201cWe have Brogg, Gavin the Trader, the Great Walrus\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Howd Wanderer walks alone, Tormund says, but there\u2019s still Harle the Huntsman, Harle the Handsome, Blind Doss\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Ygon Oldfather commands a following, but most are his owns sons and grandsons. He has eighteen wives, half of them stolen on raids. Which of these\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d Bowen Marsh had said. \u201cI know all these men by their deeds. We should be fitting them for nooses, not giving them our castles.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d Othell Yarwyck had agreed. \u201cBad and worse and worst makes a beggar\u2019s choice. My lord had as well present us with a pack of wolves and ask which we\u2019d like to tear our throats out.\u201d\nIt was the same again with Hardhome. Satin poured whilst Jon told them of his audience with the queen. Marsh listened attentively, ignoring the mulled wine, whilst Yarwyck drank one cup and then another. But no sooner had Jon finished than the Lord Steward said, \u201cHer Grace is wise. Let them die.\u201d\nJon sat back. \u201cIs that the only counsel you can offer, my lord? Tormund is bringing eighty men. How many should we send? Shall we call upon the giants? The spearwives at Long Barrow? If we have women with us, it may put Mother Mole\u2019s people at ease.\u201d\n\u201cSend women, then. Send giants. Send suckling babes. Is that what my lord wishes to hear?\u201d Bowen Marsh rubbed at the scar he had won at the Bridge of Skulls. \u201cSend them all. The more we lose, the fewer mouths we\u2019ll have to feed.\u201d\nYarwyck was no more helpful. \u201cIf the wildlings at Hardhome need saving, let the wildlings here go save them. Tormund knows the way to Hardhome. To hear him talk, he can save them all himself with his huge member.\u201d\nThis was pointless, Jon thought. Pointless, fruitless, hopeless. \u201cThank you for your counsel, my lords.\u201d\nSatin helped them back into their cloaks. As they walked through the armory, Ghost sniffed at them, his tail upraised and bristling. My brothers. The Night\u2019s Watch needed leaders with the wisdom of Maester Aemon, the learning of Samwell Tarly, the courage of Qhorin Halfhand, the stubborn strength of the Old Bear, the compassion of Donal Noye. What it had instead was them.\nThe snow was falling heavily outside. \u201cWind\u2019s from the south,\u201d Yarwyck observed. \u201cIt\u2019s blowing the snow right up against the Wall. See?\u201d\nHe was right. The switchback stair was buried almost to the first landing, Jon saw, and the wooden doors of the ice cells and storerooms had vanished behind a wall of white. \u201cHow many men do we have in ice cells?\u201d he asked Bowen Marsh.\n\u201cFour living men. Two dead ones.\u201d\nThe corpses. Jon had almost forgotten them. He had hoped to learn something from the bodies they\u2019d brought back from the weirwood grove, but the dead men had stubbornly remained dead. \u201cWe need to dig those cells out.\u201d\n\u201cTen stewards and ten spades should do it,\u201d said Marsh.\n\u201cUse Wun Wun too.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d\nTen stewards and one giant made short work of the drifts, but even when the doors were clear again, Jon was not satisfied. \u201cThose cells will be buried again by morning. We\u2019d best move the prisoners before they smother.\u201d\n\u201cKarstark too, m\u2019lord?\u201d asked Fulk the Flea. \u201cCan\u2019t we just leave that one shivering till spring?\u201d\n\u201cWould that we could.\u201d Cregan Karstark had taken to howling in the night of late, and throwing frozen feces at whoever came to feed him. That had not made him beloved of his guards. \u201cTake him to the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower. The undervault should hold him.\u201d Though partly collapsed, the Old Bear\u2019s former seat would be warmer than the ice cells. Its subcellars were largely intact.\nCregan kicked at the guards when they came through the door, twisted and shoved when they grabbed him, even tried to bite them. But the cold had weakened him, and Jon\u2019s men were bigger, younger, and stronger. They hauled him out, still struggling, and dragged him through thigh-high snow to his new home.\n\u201cWhat would the lord commander like us to do with his corpses?\u201d asked Marsh when the living men had been moved.\n\u201cLeave them.\u201d If the storm entombed them, well and good. He would need to burn them eventually, no doubt, but for the nonce they were bound with iron chains inside their cells. That, and being dead, should suffice to hold them harmless.\nTormund Giantsbane timed his arrival perfectly, thundering up with his warriors when all the shoveling was done. Only fifty seemed to have turned up, not the eighty Toregg promised Leathers, but Tormund was not called Tall-Talker for naught. The wildling arrived red-faced, shouting for a horn of ale and something hot to eat. He had ice in his beard and more crusting his mustache.\nSomeone had already told the Thunderfist about Gerrick Kingsblood and his new style. \u201cKing o\u2019 the Wildlings?\u201d Tormund roared. \u201cHar! King o\u2019 My Hairy Butt Crack, more like.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a regal look to him,\u201d Jon said.\n\u201cHe has a little red cock to go with all that red hair, that\u2019s what he has. Raymund Redbeard and his sons died at Long Lake, thanks to your bloody Starks and the Drunken Giant. Not the little brother. Ever wonder why they called him the Red Raven?\u201d Tormund\u2019s mouth split in a gap-toothed grin. \u201cFirst to fly the battle, he was. \u2019Twas a song about it, after. The singer had to find a rhyme for craven, so\u00a0\u2026\u201d He wiped his nose. \u201cIf your queen\u2019s knights want those girls o\u2019 his, they\u2019re welcome to them.\u201d\n\u201cGirls,\u201d squawked Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cGirls, girls.\u201d\nThat set Tormund to laughing all over again. \u201cNow there\u2019s a bird with sense. How much do you want for him, Snow? I gave you a son, the least you could do is give me the bloody bird.\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut like as not you\u2019d eat him.\u201d\nTormund roared at that as well. \u201cEat,\u201d the raven said darkly, flapping its black wings. \u201cCorn? Corn? Corn?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to talk about the ranging,\u201d said Jon. \u201cI want us to be of one mind at the Shieldhall, we must\u2014\u201d He broke off when Mully poked his nose inside the door, grim-faced, to announce that Clydas had brought a letter.\n\u201cTell him to leave it with you. I will read it later.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, m\u2019lord, only\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Clydas don\u2019t look his proper self\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019s more white than pink, if you get my meaning\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and he\u2019s shaking.\u201d\n\u201cDark wings, dark words,\u201d muttered Tormund. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you kneelers say?\u201d\n\u201cWe say, Bleed a cold but feast a fever too,\u201d Jon told him. \u201cWe say, Never drink with Dornishmen when the moon is full. We say a lot of things.\u201d\nMully added his two groats. \u201cMy old grandmother always used to say, Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s sufficient wisdom for the moment,\u201d said Jon Snow. \u201cShow Clydas in if you would be so good.\u201d\nMully had not been wrong; the old steward was trembling, his face as pale as the snows outside. \u201cI am being foolish, Lord Commander, but\u00a0\u2026\u00a0this letter frightens me. See here?\u201d\nBastard, was the only word written outside the scroll. No Lord Snow or Jon Snow or Lord Commander. Simply Bastard. And the letter was sealed with a smear of hard pink wax. \u201cYou were right to come at once,\u201d Jon said. You were right to be afraid. He cracked the seal, flattened the parchment, and read.",

The night is dark, and the paths will be slippery with snow. Satin, go with them.\u201d He handed Tormund Giantsbane the letter. \u201cHere, see for yourself.\u201d\nThe wildling gave the letter a dubious look and handed it right back. \u201cFeels nasty\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Tormund Thunderfist had better things to do than learn to make papers talk at him. They never have any good to say, now do they?\u201d\n\u201cNot often,\u201d Jon Snow admitted. Dark wings, dark words. Perhaps there was more truth to those wise old sayings than he\u2019d known. \u201cIt was sent by Ramsay Snow. I\u2019ll read you what he wrote.\u201d\nWhen he was done, Tormund whistled. \u201cHar. That\u2019s buggered, and no mistake. What was that about Mance? Has him in a cage, does he? How, when hundreds saw your red witch burn the man?\u201d\nThat was Rattleshirt, Jon almost said. That was sorcery. A glamor, she called it. \u201cMelisandre\u00a0\u2026\u00a0look to the skies, she said.\u201d He set the letter down. \u201cA raven in a storm. She saw this coming.\u201d When you have your answers, send to me.\n\u201cMight be all a skin o\u2019 lies.\u201d Tormund scratched under his beard. \u201cIf I had me a nice goose quill and a pot o\u2019 maester\u2019s ink, I could write down that me member was long and thick as me arm, wouldn\u2019t make it so.\u201d\n\u201cHe has Lightbringer. He talks of heads upon the walls of Winterfell. He knows about the spearwives and their number.\u201d He knows about Mance Rayder. \u201cNo. There is truth in there.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong. What do you mean to do, crow?\u201d\nJon flexed the fingers of his sword hand. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part. He closed his fist and opened it again. What you propose is nothing less than treason. He thought of Robb, with snowflakes melting in his hair. Kill the boy and let the man be born. He thought of Bran, clambering up a tower wall, agile as a monkey. Of Rickon\u2019s breathless laughter. Of Sansa, brushing out Lady\u2019s coat and singing to herself. You know nothing, Jon Snow. He thought of Arya, her hair as tangled as a bird\u2019s nest. I made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to Winterfell\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want my bride back\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want my bride back\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I want my bride back\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cI think we had best change the plan,\u201d Jon Snow said.\nThey talked for the best part of two hours.\nHorse and Rory had replaced Fulk and Mully at the armory door with the change of watch. \u201cWith me,\u201d Jon told them, when the time came. Ghost would have followed as well, but as the wolf came padding after them, Jon grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and wrestled him back inside. Borroq might be amongst those gathering at the Shieldhall. The last thing he needed just now was his wolf savaging the skinchanger\u2019s boar.\nThe Shieldhall was one of the older parts of Castle Black, a long drafty feast hall of dark stone, its oaken rafters black with the smoke of centuries. Back when the Night\u2019s Watch had been much larger, its walls had been hung with rows of brightly colored wooden shields. Then as now, when a knight took the black, tradition decreed that he set aside his former arms and take up the plain black shield of the brotherhood. The shields thus discarded would hang in the Shieldhall.\nHundreds of knights meant hundreds of shields. Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, bulls, trees and flowers, harps, spears, crabs and krakens, red lions and golden lions and chequy lions, owls, lambs, maids and mermen, stallions, stars, buckets and buckles, flayed men and hanged men and burning men, axes, longswords, turtles, unicorns, bears, quills, spiders and snakes and scorpions, and a hundred other heraldic charges had adorned the Shieldhall walls, blazoned in more colors than any rainbow ever dreamed of.\nBut when a knight died, his shield was taken down, that it might go with him to his pyre or his tomb, and over the years and centuries fewer and fewer knights had taken the black. A day came when it no longer made sense for the knights of Castle Black to dine apart. The Shieldhall was abandoned. In the last hundred years, it had been used only infrequently. As a dining hall, it left much to be desired\u2014it was dark, dirty, drafty, and hard to heat in winter, its cellars infested with rats, its massive wooden rafters worm-eaten and festooned with cobwebs.\nBut it was large and long enough to seat two hundred, and half again that many if they crowded close. When Jon and Tormund entered, a sound went through the hall, like wasps stirring in a nest. The wildlings outnumbered the crows by five to one, judging by how little black he saw. Fewer than a dozen shields remained, sad grey things with faded paint and long cracks in the wood. But fresh torches burned in the iron sconces along the walls, and Jon had ordered benches and tables brought in. Men with comfortable seats were more inclined to listen, Maester Aemon had once told him; standing men were more inclined to shout.\nAt the top of the hall a sagging platform stood. Jon mounted it, with Tormund Giantsbane at his side, and raised his hands for quiet. The wasps only buzzed the louder. Then Tormund put his warhorn to his lips and blew a blast. The sound filled the hall, echoing off the rafters overhead. Silence fell.\n\u201cI summoned you to make plans for the relief of Hardhome,\u201d Jon Snow began. \u201cThousands of the free folk are gathered there, trapped and starving, and we have had reports of dead things in the wood.\u201d To his left he saw Marsh and Yarwyck. Othell was surrounded by his builders, whilst Bowen had Wick Whittlestick, Left Hand Lew, and Alf of Runnymudd beside him. To his right, Soren Shieldbreaker sat with his arms crossed against his chest. Farther back, Jon saw Gavin the Trader and Harle the Handsome whispering together. Ygon Oldfather sat amongst his wives, Howd Wanderer alone. Borroq leaned against a wall in a dark corner. Mercifully, his boar was nowhere in evidence. \u201cThe ships I sent to take off Mother Mole and her people have been wracked by storms. We must send what help we can by land or let them die.\u201d Two of Queen Selyse\u2019s knights had come as well, Jon saw. Ser Narbert and Ser Benethon stood near the door at the foot of the hall. But the rest of the queen\u2019s men were conspicuous in their absence. \u201cI had hoped to lead the ranging myself and bring back as many of the free folk as could survive the journey.\u201d A flash of red in the back of the hall caught Jon\u2019s eye. Lady Melisandre had arrived. \u201cBut now I find I cannot go to Hardhome. The ranging will be led by Tormund Giantsbane, known to you all. I have promised him as many men as he requires.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where will you be, crow?\u201d Borroq thundered. \u201cHiding here in Castle Black with your white dog?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I ride south.\u201d Then Jon read them the letter Ramsay Snow had written.\nThe Shieldhall went mad.\nEvery man began to shout at once. They leapt to their feet, shaking fists. So much for the calming power of comfortable benches. Swords were brandished, axes smashed against shields. Jon Snow looked to Tormund. The Giantsbane sounded his horn once more, twice as long and twice as loud as the first time.\n\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Jon reminded them when some semblance of quiet had returned. \u201cIt is not for us to oppose the Bastard of Bolton, to avenge Stannis Baratheon, to defend his widow and his daughter. This creature who makes cloaks from the skins of women has sworn to cut my heart out, and I mean to make him answer for those words\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but I will not ask my brothers to forswear their vows.\n\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch will make for Hardhome. I ride to Winterfell alone, unless\u00a0\u2026\u201d Jon paused. \u201c\u2026\u00a0is there any man here who will come stand with me?\u201d\nThe roar was all he could have hoped for, the tumult so loud that the two old shields tumbled from the walls. Soren Shieldbreaker was on his feet, the Wanderer as well. Toregg the Tall, Brogg, Harle the Huntsman and Harle the Handsome both, Ygon Oldfather, Blind Doss, even the Great Walrus. I have my swords, thought Jon Snow, and we are coming for you, Bastard.\nYarwyck and Marsh were slipping out, he saw, and all their men behind them. It made no matter. He did not need them now. He did not want them. No man can ever say I made my brothers break their vows. If this is oathbreaking, the crime is mine and mine alone. Then Tormund was pounding him on the back, all gap-toothed grin from ear to ear. \u201cWell spoken, crow. Now bring out the mead! Make them yours and get them drunk, that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. We\u2019ll make a wildling o\u2019 you yet, boy. Har!\u201d\n\u201cI will send for ale,\u201d Jon said, distracted. Melisandre was gone, he realized, and so were the queen\u2019s knights. I should have gone to Selyse first. She has the right to know her lord is dead. \u201cYou must excuse me. I\u2019ll leave you to get them drunk.\u201d\n\u201cHar! A task I\u2019m well suited for, crow. On your way!\u201d\nHorse and Rory fell in beside Jon as he left the Shieldhall. I should talk with Melisandre after I see the queen, he thought. If she could see a raven in a storm, she can find Ramsay Snow for me. Then he heard the shouting\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and a roar so loud it seemed to shake the Wall. \u201cThat come from Hardin\u2019s Tower, m\u2019lord,\u201d Horse reported. He might have said more, but the scream cut him off.\nVal, was Jon\u2019s first thought. But that was no woman\u2019s scream. That is a man in mortal agony. He broke into a run. Horse and Rory raced after him. \u201cIs it wights?\u201d asked Rory. Jon wondered. Could his corpses have escaped their chains?\nThe screaming had stopped by the time they came to Hardin\u2019s Tower, but Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun was still roaring. The giant was dangling a bloody corpse by one leg, the same way Arya used to dangle her doll when she was small, swinging it like a morningstar when menaced by vegetables. Arya never tore her dolls to pieces, though. The dead man\u2019s sword arm was yards away, the snow beneath it turning red.\n\u201cLet him go,\u201d Jon shouted. \u201cWun Wun, let him go.\u201d\nWun Wun did not hear or did not understand. The giant was bleeding himself, with sword cuts on his belly and his arm. He swung the dead knight against the grey stone of the tower, again and again and again, until the man\u2019s head was red and pulpy as a summer melon. The knight\u2019s cloak flapped in the cold air. Of white wool it had been, bordered in cloth-of-silver and patterned with blue stars. Blood and bone were flying everywhere.\nMen poured from the surrounding keeps and towers. Northmen, free folk, queen\u2019s men\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u201cForm a line,\u201d Jon Snow commanded them. \u201cKeep them back. Everyone, but especially the queen\u2019s men.\u201d The dead man was Ser Patrek of King\u2019s Mountain; his head was largely gone, but his heraldry was as distinctive as his face. Jon did not want to risk Ser Malegorn or Ser Brus or any of the queen\u2019s other knights trying to avenge him.\nWun Weg Wun Dar Wun howled again and gave Ser Patrek\u2019s other arm a twist and pull. It tore loose from his shoulder with a spray of bright red blood. Like a child pulling petals off a daisy, thought Jon. \u201cLeathers, talk to him, calm him. The Old Tongue, he understands the Old Tongue. Keep back, the rest of you. Put away your steel, we\u2019re scaring him.\u201d Couldn\u2019t they see the giant had been cut? Jon had to put an end to this or more men would die. They had no idea of Wun Wun\u2019s strength. A horn, I need a horn. He saw the glint of steel, turned toward it. \u201cNo blades!\u201d he screamed. \u201cWick, put that knife\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u2026\u00a0away, he meant to say. When Wick Whittlestick slashed at his throat, the word turned into a grunt. Jon twisted from the knife, just enough so it barely grazed his skin. He cut me. When he put his hand to the side of his neck, blood welled between his fingers. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cFor the Watch.\u201d Wick slashed at him again. This time Jon caught his wrist and bent his arm back until he dropped the dagger. The gangling steward backed away, his hands upraised as if to say, Not me, it was not me. Men were screaming. Jon reached for Longclaw, but his fingers had grown stiff and clumsy. Somehow he could not seem to get the sword free of its scabbard.\nThen Bowen Marsh stood there before him, tears running down his cheeks. \u201cFor the Watch.\u201d He punched Jon in the belly. When he pulled his hand away, the dagger stayed where he had buried it.\nJon fell to his knees. He found the dagger\u2019s hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. \u201cGhost,\u201d he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold\u00a0\u2026",

      "content": "THE QUEEN\u2019S HAND\nThe Dornish prince was three days dying.\nHe took his last shuddering breath in the bleak black dawn, as cold rain hissed from a dark sky to turn the brick streets of the old city into rivers. The rain had drowned the worst of the fires, but wisps of smoke still rose from the smoldering ruin that had been the pyramid of Hazkar, and the great black pyramid of Yherizan where Rhaegal had made his lair hulked in the gloom like a fat woman bedecked with glowing orange jewels.\nPerhaps the gods are not deaf after all, Ser Barristan Selmy reflected as he watched those distant embers. If not for the rain, the fires might have consumed all of Meereen by now.\nHe saw no sign of dragons, but he had not expected to. The dragons did not like the rain. A thin red slash marked the eastern horizon where the sun might soon appear. It reminded Selmy of the first blood welling from a wound. Often, even with a deep cut, the blood came before the pain.\nHe stood beside the parapets of the highest step of the Great Pyramid, searching the sky as he did every morning, knowing that the dawn must come and hoping that his queen would come with it. She will not have abandoned us, she would never leave her people, he was telling himself, when he heard the prince\u2019s death rattle coming from the queen\u2019s apartments.\nSer Barristan went inside. Rainwater ran down the back of his white cloak, and his boots left wet tracks on the floors and carpets. At his command, Quentyn Martell had been laid out in the queen\u2019s own bed. He had been a knight, and a prince of Dorne besides. It seemed only kind to let him die in the bed he had crossed half a world to reach. The bedding was ruined\u2014sheets, covers, pillows, mattress, all reeked of blood and smoke, but Ser Barristan thought Daenerys would forgive him.\nMissandei sat at the bedside. She had been with the prince night and day, tending to such needs as he could express, giving him water and milk of the poppy when he was strong enough to drink, listening to the few tortured words he gasped out from time to time, reading to him when he fell quiet, sleeping in her chair beside him. Ser Barristan had asked some of the queen\u2019s cupbearers to help, but the sight of the burned man was too much for even the boldest of them. And the Blue Graces had never come, though he\u2019d sent for them four times. Perhaps the last of them had been carried off by the pale mare by now.\nThe tiny Naathi scribe looked up at his approach. \u201cHonored ser. The prince is beyond pain now. His Dornish gods have taken him home. See? He smiles.\u201d\nHow can you tell? He has no lips. It would have been kinder if the dragons had devoured him. That at least would have been quick. This\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Fire is a hideous way to die. Small wonder half the hells are made of flame. \u201cCover him.\u201d\nMissandei pulled the coverlet over the prince\u2019s face. \u201cWhat will be done with him, ser? He is so very far from home.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that he\u2019s returned to Dorne.\u201d But how? As ashes? That would require more fire, and Ser Barristan could not stomach that. We\u2019ll need to strip the flesh from his bones. Beetles, not boiling. The silent sisters would have seen to it at home, but this was Slaver\u2019s Bay. The nearest silent sister was ten thousand leagues away. \u201cYou should go sleep now, child. In your own bed.\u201d\n\u201cIf this one may be so bold, ser, you should do the same. You do not sleep the whole night through.\u201d\nNot for many years, child. Not since the Trident. Grand Maester Pycelle had once told him that old men do not need as much sleep as the young, but it was more than that. He had reached that age when he was loath to close his eyes, for fear that he might never open them again. Other men might wish to die in bed asleep, but that was no death for a knight of the Kingsguard.\n\u201cThe nights are too long,\u201d he told Missandei, \u201cand there is much and more to do, always. Here, as in the Seven Kingdoms. But you have done enough for now, child. Go and rest.\u201d And if the gods are good, you will not dream of dragons.\nAfter the girl was gone, the old knight peeled back the coverlet for one last look at Quentyn Martell\u2019s face, or what remained of it. So much of the prince\u2019s flesh had sloughed away that he could see the skull beneath. His eyes were pools of pus. He should have stayed in Dorne. He should have stayed a frog. Not all men are meant to dance with dragons. As he covered the boy once more, he found himself wondering whether there would be anyone to cover his queen, or whether her own corpse would lie unmourned amongst the tall grasses of the Dothraki sea, staring blindly at the sky until her flesh fell from her bones.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cDaenerys is not dead. She was riding that dragon. I saw it with mine own two eyes.\u201d He had said the same a hundred times before\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but every day that passed made it harder to believe. Her hair was afire. I saw that too. She was burning\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and if I did not see her fall, hundreds swear they did.\nDay had crept upon the city. Though the rain still fell, a vague light suffused the eastern sky. And with the sun arrived the Shavepate. Skahaz was clad in his familiar garb of pleated black skirt, greaves, and muscled breastplate. The brazen mask beneath his arm was new\u2014a wolf\u2019s head with lolling tongue. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, by way of greeting, \u201cthe fool is dead, is he?\u201d\n\u201cPrince Quentyn died just before first light.\u201d Selmy was not surprised that Skahaz knew. Word traveled quickly within the pyramid. \u201cIs the council assembled?\u201d\n\u201cThey await the Hand\u2019s pleasure below.\u201d\nI am no Hand, a part of him wanted to cry out. I am only a simple knight, the queen\u2019s protector. I never wanted this. But with the queen gone and the king in chains, someone had to rule, and Ser Barristan did not trust the Shavepate. \u201cHas there been any word from the Green Grace?\u201d\n\u201cShe is not yet returned to the city.\u201d Skahaz had opposed sending the priestess. Nor had Galazza Galare herself embraced the task. She would go, she allowed, for the sake of peace, but Hizdahr zo Loraq was better suited to treat with the Wise Masters. But Ser Barristan did not yield easily, and finally the Green Grace had bowed her head and sworn to do her best.\n\u201cHow stands the city?\u201d Selmy asked the Shavepate now.\n\u201cAll the gates are closed and barred, as you commanded. We are hunting down any sellswords or Yunkai\u2019i left inside the city and expelling or arresting those we catch. Most seem to have gone to ground. Inside the pyramids, beyond a doubt. The Unsullied man the walls and towers, ready for any assault. There are two hundred highborn gathered in the square, standing in the rain in their tokars and howling for audience. They want Hizdahr free and me dead, and they want you to slay these dragons. Someone told them knights were good at that. Men are still pulling corpses from the pyramid of Hazkar. The Great Masters of Yherizan and Uhlez have abandoned their own pyramids to the dragons.\u201d\nSer Barristan had known all that. \u201cAnd the butcher\u2019s tally?\u201d he asked, dreading the answer.\n\u201cNine-and-twenty.\u201d\n\u201cNine-and-twenty?\u201d That was far worse than he could ever have imagined. The Sons of the Harpy had resumed their shadow war two days ago. Three murders the first night, nine the second. But to go from nine to nine-and-twenty in a single night\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cThe count will pass thirty before midday. Why do you look so grey, old man? What did you expect? The Harpy wants Hizdahr free, so he has sent his sons back into the streets with knives in hand. The dead are all freedmen and shavepates, as before. One was mine, a Brazen Beast. The sign of the Harpy was left beside the bodies, chalked on the pavement or scratched into a wall. There were messages as well. \u2018Dragons must die,\u2019 they wrote, and \u2018Harghaz the Hero.\u2019 \u2018Death to Daenerys\u2019 was seen as well, before the rain washed out the words.\u201d\n\u201cThe blood tax\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-nine hundred pieces of gold from each pyramid, aye,\u201d Skahaz grumbled. \u201cIt will be collected\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the loss of a few coins will never stay the Harpy\u2019s hand. Only blood can do that.\u201d\n\u201cSo you say.\u201d The hostages again. He would kill them every one if I allowed it. \u201cI heard you the first hundred times. No.\u201d\n\u201cQueen\u2019s Hand,\u201d Skahaz grumbled with disgust. \u201cAn old woman\u2019s hand, I am thinking, wrinkled and feeble. I pray Daenerys returns to us soon.\u201d He pulled his brazen wolf\u2019s mask down over his face. \u201cYour council will be growing restless.\u201d\n\u201cThey are the queen\u2019s council, not mine.\u201d Selmy exchanged his damp cloak for a dry one and buckled on his sword belt, then accompanied the Shavepate down the steps.\nThe pillared hall was empty of petitioners this morning. Though he had assumed the title of Hand, Ser Barristan would not presume to hold court in the queen\u2019s absence, nor would he permit Skahaz mo Kandaq to do such. Hizdahr\u2019s grotesque dragon thrones had been removed at Ser Barristan\u2019s command, but he had not brought back the simple pillowed bench the queen had favored. Instead a large round table had been set up in the center of the hall, with tall chairs all around it where men might sit and talk as peers.\nThey rose when Ser Barristan came down the marble steps, Skahaz Shavepate at his side. Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men was present, with Symon Stripeback, commander of the Free Brothers. The Stalwart Shields had chosen a new commander, a black-skinned Summer Islander called Tal Toraq, their old captain, Mollono Yos Dob, having been carried off by the pale mare. Grey Worm was there for the Unsullied, attended by three eunuch serjeants in spiked bronze caps. The Stormcrows were represented by two seasoned sellswords, an archer named Jokin and the scarred and sour axeman known simply as the Widower. The two of them had assumed joint command of the company in the absence of Daario Naharis. Most of the queen\u2019s khalasar had gone with Aggo and Rakharo to search for her on the Dothraki sea, but the squinty, bowlegged jaqqa rhan Rommo was there to speak for the riders who remained.\nAnd across the table from Ser Barristan sat four of King Hizdahr\u2019s erstwhile guardsmen, the pit fighters Goghor the Giant, Belaquo Bonebreaker, Camarron of the Count, and the Spotted Cat. Selmy had insisted on their presence, over the objections of Skahaz Shavepate. They had helped Daenerys Targaryen take this city once, and that should not be forgotten. Blood-soaked brutes and killers they might be, but in their own way they had been loyal\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to King Hizdahr, yes, but to the queen as well.\nLast to come, Strong Belwas lumbered into the hall.\nThe eunuch had looked death in the face, so near he might have kissed her on the lips. It had marked him. He looked to have lost two stone of weight, and the dark brown skin that had once stretched tight across a massive chest and belly, crossed by a hundred faded scars, now hung on him in loose folds, sagging and wobbling, like a robe cut three sizes too large. His step had slowed as well, and seemed a bit uncertain.\nEven so, the sight of him gladdened the old knight\u2019s heart. He had once crossed the world with Strong Belwas, and he knew he could rely on him, should all this come to swords. \u201cBelwas. We are pleased that you could join us.\u201d\n\u201cWhitebeard.\u201d Belwas smiled. \u201cWhere is liver and onions? Strong Belwas is not so strong as before, he must eat, get big again. They made Strong Belwas sick. Someone must die.\u201d\nSomeone will. Many someones, like as not. \u201cSit, my friend.\u201d When Belwas sat and crossed his arms, Ser Barristan went on. \u201cQuentyn Martell died this morning, just before the dawn.\u201d\nThe Widower laughed. \u201cThe dragonrider.\u201d\n\u201cFool, I call him,\u201d said Symon Stripeback.\nNo, just a boy. Ser Barristan had not forgotten the follies of his own youth. \u201cSpeak no ill of the dead. The prince paid a ghastly price for what he did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other Dornish?\u201d asked Tal Taraq.\n\u201cPrisoners, for the nonce.\u201d Neither of the Dornishmen had offered any resistance. Archibald Yronwood had been cradling his prince\u2019s scorched and smoking body when the Brazen Beasts had found him, as his burned hands could testify. He had used them to beat out the flames that had engulfed Quentyn Martell. Gerris Drinkwater was standing over them with sword in hand, but he had dropped the blade the moment the locusts had appeared. \u201cThey share a cell.\u201d\n\u201cLet them share a gibbet,\u201d said Symon Stripeback. \u201cThey unleashed two dragons on the city.\u201d\n\u201cOpen the pits and give them swords,\u201d urged the Spotted Cat. \u201cI will kill them both as all Meereen shouts out my name.\u201d\n\u201cThe fighting pits will remain closed,\u201d said Selmy. \u201cBlood and noise would only serve to call the dragons.\u201d\n\u201cAll three, perhaps,\u201d suggested Marselen. \u201cThe black beast came once, why not again? This time with our queen.\u201d\nOr without her. Should Drogon return to Meereen without Daenerys mounted on his back, the city would erupt in blood and flame, of that Ser Barristan had no doubt. The very men sitting at this table would soon be at dagger points with one another. A young girl she might be, but Daenerys Targaryen was the only thing that held them all together.\n\u201cHer Grace will return when she returns,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cWe have herded a thousand sheep into the Daznak\u2019s Pit, filled the Pit of Ghrazz with bullocks, and the Golden Pit with beasts that Hizdahr zo Loraq had gathered for his games.\u201d Thus far both dragons seemed to have a taste for mutton, returning to Daznak\u2019s whenever they grew hungry. If either one was hunting man, inside or outside the city, Ser Barristan had yet to hear of it. The only Meereenese the dragons had slain since Harghaz the Hero had been the slavers foolish enough to object when Rhaegal attempted to make his lair atop the pyramid of Hazkar. \u201cWe have more pressing matters to discuss. I have sent the Green Grace to the Yunkishmen to make arrangements for the release of our hostages. I expect her back by midday with their answer.\u201d\n\u201cWith words,\u201d said the Widower. \u201cThe Stormcrows know the Yunkai\u2019i. Their tongues are worms that wriggle this way or that. The Green Grace will come back with worm words, not the captain.\u201d\n\u201cIf it pleases the Queen\u2019s Hand to recall, the Wise Masters hold our Hero too,\u201d said Grey Worm. \u201cAlso the horselord Jhogo, the queen\u2019s own blood rider.\u201d\n\u201cBlood of her blood,\u201d agreed the Dothraki Rommo. \u201cHe must be freed. The honor of the khalasar demands it.\u201d\n\u201cHe shall be freed,\u201d said Ser Barristan, \u201cbut first we must needs wait and see if the Green Grace can accomplish\u2014\u201d\nSkahaz Shavepate slammed his fist upon the table. \u201cThe Green Grace will accomplish nothing. She may be conspiring with the Yunkai\u2019i even as we sit here. Arrangements, did you say? Make arrangements? What sort of arrangements?\u201d\n\u201cRansom,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cEach man\u2019s weight in gold.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wise Masters do not need our gold, ser,\u201d said Marselen. \u201cThey are richer than your Westerosi lords, every one.\u201d\n\u201cTheir sellswords will want the gold, though. What are the hostages to them? If the Yunkishmen refuse, it will drive a blade between them and their hirelings.\u201d Or so I hope. It had been Missandei who suggested the ploy to him. He would never have thought of such a thing himself. In King\u2019s Landing, bribes had been Littlefinger\u2019s domain, whilst Lord Varys had the task of fostering division amongst the crown\u2019s enemies. His own duties had been more straightforward. Eleven years of age, yet Missandei is as clever as half the men at this table and wiser than all of them. \u201cI have instructed the Green Grace to present the offer only when all of the Yunkish commanders have assembled to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cThey will refuse, even so,\u201d insisted Symon Stripeback. \u201cThey will say they want the dragons dead, the king restored.\u201d\n\u201cI pray that you are wrong.\u201d And fear that you are right.\n\u201cYour gods are far away, Ser Grandfather,\u201d said the Widower. \u201cI do not think they hear your prayers. And when the Yunkai\u2019i send back the old woman to spit in your eye, what then?\u201d\n\u201cFire and blood,\u201d said Barristan Selmy, softly, softly.\nFor a long moment no one spoke. Then Strong Belwas slapped his belly and said, \u201cBetter than liver and onions,\u201d and Skahaz Shavepate stared through the eyes of his wolf\u2019s head mask and said, \u201cYou would break King Hizdahr\u2019s peace, old man?\u201d\n\u201cI would shatter it.\u201d Once, long ago, a prince had named him Barristan the Bold. A part of that boy was in him still. \u201cWe have built a beacon atop the pyramid where once the Harpy stood. Dry wood soaked with oil, covered to keep the rain off. Should the hour come, and I pray that it does not, we will light that beacon. The flames will be your signal to pour out of our gates and attack. Every man of you will have a part to play, so every man must be in readiness at all times, day or night. We will destroy our foes or be destroyed ourselves.\u201d He raised a hand to signal to his waiting squires. \u201cI have had some maps prepared to show the dispositions of our foes, their camps and siege lines and trebuchets. If we can break the slavers, their sellswords will abandon them. I know you will have concerns and questions. Voice them here. By the time we leave this table, all of us must be of a single mind, with a single purpose.\u201d\n\u201cBest send down for some food and drink, then,\u201d suggested Symon Stripeback. \u201cThis will take a while.\u201d\nIt took the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon. The captains and commanders argued over the maps like fishwives over a bucket of crabs. Weak points and strong points, how to best employ their small company of archers, whether the elephants should be used to break the Yunkish lines or held in reserve, who should have the honor of leading the first advance, whether their horse cavalry was best deployed on the flanks or in the vanguard.\nSer Barristan let each man speak his mind. Tal Toraq thought that they should march on Yunkai once they had broken through the lines; the Yellow City would be almost undefended, so the Yunkai\u2019i would have no choice but to lift the siege and follow. The Spotted Cat proposed to challenge the enemy to send forth a champion to face him in single combat. Strong Belwas liked that notion but insisted he should fight, not the Cat. Camarron of the Count put forth a scheme to seize the ships tied up along the riverfront and use the Skahazadhan to bring three hundred pit fighters around the Yunkish rear. Every man there agreed that the Unsullied were their best troops, but none agreed on how they should be deployed. The Widower wanted to use the eunuchs as an iron fist to smash through the heart of the Yunkish defenses. Marselen felt they would be better placed at either end of the main battle line, where they could beat back any attempt by the foe to turn their flanks. Symon Stripeback wanted them split into three and divided amongst the three companies of freedmen. His Free Brothers were brave and eager for the fight, he claimed, but without the Unsullied to stiffen them he feared his unblooded troops might not have the discipline to face battle-seasoned sellswords by themselves. Grey Worm said only that the Unsullied would obey, whatever might be asked of them.\nAnd when all that had been discussed, debated, and decided, Symon Stripeback raised one final point. \u201cAs a slave in Yunkai I helped my master bargain with the free companies and saw to the payment of their wages. I know sellswords, and I know that the Yunkai\u2019i cannot pay them near enough to face dragonflame. So I ask you\u00a0\u2026\u00a0if the peace should fail and this battle should be joined, will the dragons come? Will they join the fight?\u201d\nThey will come, Ser Barristan might have said. The noise will bring them, the shouts and screams, the scent of blood. That will draw them to the battlefield, just as the roar from Daznak\u2019s Pit drew Drogon to the scarlet sands. But when they come, will they know one side from the other? Somehow he did not think so. So he said only, \u201cThe dragons will do what the dragons will do. If they do come, it may be that just the shadow of their wings will be enough to dishearten the slavers and send them fleeing.\u201d Then he thanked them and dismissed them all.\nGrey Worm lingered after the others had left. \u201cThese ones will be ready when the beacon fire is lit. But the Hand must surely know that when we attack, the Yunkai\u2019i will kill the hostages.\u201d\n\u201cI will do all I can to prevent that, my friend. I have a\u00a0\u2026\u00a0notion. But pray excuse me. It is past time the Dornishmen heard that their prince is dead.\u201d\nGrey Worm inclined his head. \u201cThis one obeys.\u201d\nSer Barristan took two of his new-made knights with him down into the dungeons. Grief and guilt had been known to drive good men into madness, and Archibald Yronwood and Gerris Drinkwater had both played roles in their friend\u2019s demise. But when they reached the cell, he told Tum and the Red Lamb to wait outside whilst he went in to tell the Dornish that the prince\u2019s agony was over.\nSer Archibald, the big bald one, had nothing to say. He sat on the edge of his pallet, staring down at his bandaged hands in their linen wrappings. Ser Gerris punched a wall. \u201cI told him it was folly. I begged him to go home. Your bitch of a queen had no use for him, any man could see that. He crossed the world to offer her his love and fealty, and she laughed in his face.\u201d\n\u201cShe never laughed,\u201d said Selmy. \u201cIf you knew her, you would know that.\u201d\n\u201cShe spurned him. He offered her his heart, and she threw it back at him and went off to fuck her sellsword.\u201d\n\u201cYou had best guard that tongue, ser.\u201d Ser Barristan did not like this Gerris Drinkwater, nor would he allow him to vilify Daenerys. \u201cPrince Quentyn\u2019s death was his own doing, and yours.\u201d\n\u201cOurs? How are we at fault, ser? Quentyn was our friend, yes. A bit of a fool, you might say, but all dreamers are fools. But first and last he was our prince. We owed him our obedience.\u201d\nBarristan Selmy could not dispute the truth of that. He had spent the best part of his own life obeying the commands of drunkards and madmen. \u201cHe came too late.\u201d\n\u201cHe offered her his heart,\u201d Ser Gerris said again.\n\u201cShe needed swords, not hearts.\u201d\n\u201cHe would have given her the spears of Dorne as well.\u201d\n\u201cWould that he had.\u201d No one had wanted Daenerys to look with favor on the Dornish prince more than Barristan Selmy. \u201cHe came too late, though, and this folly\u00a0\u2026\u00a0buying sellswords, loosing two dragons on the city\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that was madness and worse than madness. That was treason.\u201d\n\u201cWhat he did he did for love of Queen Daenerys,\u201d Gerris Drinkwater insisted. \u201cTo prove himself worthy of her hand.\u201d\nThe old knight had heard enough. \u201cWhat Prince Quentyn did he did for Dorne. Do you take me for some doting grandfather? I have spent my life around kings and queens and princes. Sunspear means to take up arms against the Iron Throne. No, do not trouble to deny it. Doran Martell is not a man to call his spears without hope of victory. Duty brought Prince Quentyn here. Duty, honor, thirst for glory\u00a0\u2026\u00a0never love. Quentyn was here for dragons, not Daenerys.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not know him, ser. He\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, Drink.\u201d Yronwood rose to his feet. \u201cWords won\u2019t fetch him back. Cletus and Will are dead too. So shut your bloody mouth before I stick my fist in it.\u201d The big knight turned to Selmy. \u201cWhat do you mean to do with us?\u201d\n\u201cSkahaz Shavepate wants you hanged. You slew four of his men. Four of the queen\u2019s men. Two were freedmen who had followed Her Grace since Astapor.\u201d\nYronwood did not seem surprised. \u201cThe beast men, aye. I only killed the one, the basilisk head. The sellswords did the others. Don\u2019t matter, though, I know that.\u201d\n\u201cWe were protecting Quentyn,\u201d said Drinkwater. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, Drink. He knows.\u201d To Ser Barristan the big knight said, \u201cNo need to come and talk if you meant to hang us. So it\u2019s not that, is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d This one may not be as slow-witted as he seems. \u201cI have more use for you alive than dead. Serve me, and afterward I will arrange a ship to take you back to Dorne and give you Prince Quentyn\u2019s bones to return to his lord father.\u201d\nSer Archibald grimaced. \u201cWhy is it always ships? Someone needs to take Quent home, though. What do you ask of us, ser?\u201d\n\u201cYour swords.\u201d\n\u201cYou have thousands of swords.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen\u2019s freedmen are as yet unblooded. The sellswords I do not trust. Unsullied are brave soldiers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but not warriors. Not knights.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat happened when you tried to take the dragons? Tell me.\u201d\nThe Dornishmen exchanged a look. Then Drinkwater said, \u201cQuentyn told the Tattered Prince he could control them. It was in his blood, he said. He had Targaryen blood.\u201d\n\u201cBlood of the dragon.\u201d\n\u201cYes. The sellswords were supposed to help us get the dragons chained up so we could get them to the docks.\u201d\n\u201cRags arranged for a ship,\u201d said Yronwood. \u201cA big one, in case we got both dragons. And Quent was going to ride one.\u201d He looked at his bandaged hands. \u201cThe moment we got in, though, you could see none of it was going to work. The dragons were too wild. The chains\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there were bits of broken chain everywhere, big chains, links the size of your head mixed in with all these cracked and splintered bones. And Quent, Seven save him, he looked like he was going to shit his smallclothes. Caggo and Meris weren\u2019t blind, they saw it too. Then one of the crossbowmen let fly. Maybe they meant to kill the dragons all along and were only using us to get to them. You never know with Tatters. Any way you hack it off, it weren\u2019t clever. The quarrel just made the dragons angry, and they hadn\u2019t been in such a good mood to start with. Then\u00a0\u2026\u00a0then things got bad.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Windblown blew away,\u201d said Ser Gerris. \u201cQuent was screaming, covered in flames, and they were gone. Caggo, Pretty Meris, all but the dead one.\u201d\n\u201cAh, what did you expect, Drink? A cat will kill a mouse, a pig will wallow in shit, and a sellsword will run off when he\u2019s needed most. Can\u2019t be blamed. Just the nature of the beast.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Ser Barristan said. \u201cWhat did Prince Quentyn promise the Tattered Prince in return for all this help?\u201d\nHe got no answer. Ser Gerris looked at Ser Archibald. Ser Archibald looked at his hands, the floor, the door.\n\u201cPentos,\u201d said Ser Barristan. \u201cHe promised him Pentos. Say it. No words of yours can help or harm Prince Quentyn now.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Ser Archibald unhappily. \u201cIt was Pentos. They made marks on a paper, the two of them.\u201d\nThere is a chance here. \u201cWe still have Windblown in the dungeons. Those feigned deserters.\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d said Yronwood. \u201cHungerford, Straw, that lot. Some of them weren\u2019t so bad for sellswords. Others, well, might be they could stand a bit of dying. What of them?\u201d\n\u201cI mean to send them back to the Tattered Prince. And you with them. You will be two amongst thousands. Your presence in the Yunkish camps should pass unnoticed. I want you to deliver a message to the Tattered Prince. Tell him that I sent you, that I speak with the queen\u2019s voice. Tell him that we\u2019ll pay his price if he delivers us our hostages, unharmed and whole.\u201d\nSer Archibald grimaced. \u201cRags and Tatters is more like to give the two of us to Pretty Meris. He won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? The task is simple enough.\u201d Compared to stealing dragons. \u201cI once brought the queen\u2019s father out of Duskendale.\u201d\n\u201cThat was Westeros,\u201d said Gerris Drinkwater.\n\u201cThis is Meereen.\u201d\n\u201cArch cannot even hold a sword with those hands.\u201d\n\u201cHe ought not need to. You will have the sellswords with you, unless I mistake my man.\u201d\nGerris Drinkwater pushed back his mop of sun-streaked hair. \u201cMight we have some time to discuss this amongst ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Selmy.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d offered Ser Archibald, \u201cjust so long as there\u2019s no bloody boats involved. Drink will do it too.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHe don\u2019t know it yet, but he will.\u201d\nAnd that was done.\nThe simple part, at least, thought Barristan Selmy, as he made the long climb back to the summit of the pyramid. The hard part he\u2019d left in Dornish hands. His grandfather would have been aghast. The Dornishmen were knights, at least in name, though only Yronwood impressed him as having the true steel. Drinkwater had a pretty face, a glib tongue, and a fine head of hair.\nBy the time the old knight returned to the queen\u2019s rooms atop the pyramid, Prince Quentyn\u2019s corpse had been removed. Six of the young cupbearers were playing some child\u2019s game as he entered, sitting in a circle on the floor as they took turns spinning a dagger. When it wobbled to a stop they cut a lock of hair off whichever of them the blade was pointing at. Ser Barristan had played a similar game with his cousins when he was just a boy at Harvest Hall\u00a0\u2026\u00a0though in Westeros, as he recalled, kissing had been involved as well. \u201cBhakaz,\u201d he called. \u201cA cup of wine, if you would be so good. Grazhar, Azzak, the door is yours. I am expecting the Green Grace. Show her in at once when she arrives. Elsewise, I do not wish to be disturbed.\u201d\nAzzak scrambled to his feet. \u201cAs you command, Lord Hand.\u201d\nSer Barristan went out onto the terrace. The rain had stopped, though a wall of slate-grey clouds hid the setting sun as it made its descent into Slaver\u2019s Bay. A few wisps of smoke still rose from the blackened stones of Hazdar, twisted like ribbons by the wind. Far off to the east, beyond the city walls, he saw pale wings moving above a distant line of hills. Viserion. Hunting, mayhaps, or flying just to fly. He wondered where Rhaegal was. Thus far the green dragon had shown himself to be more dangerous than the white.\nWhen Bhakaz brought his wine, the old knight took one long swallow and sent the boy for water. A few cups of wine might be just the thing to help him sleep, but he would need his wits about him when Galazza Galare returned from treating with the foe. So he drank his wine well watered, as the world grew dark around him. He was very tired, and full of doubts. The Dornishmen, Hizdahr, Reznak, the attack\u00a0\u2026\u00a0was he doing the right things? Was he doing what Daenerys would have wanted? I was not made for this. Other Kingsguard had served as Hand before him. Not many, but a few. He had read of them in the White Book. Now he found himself wondering whether they had felt as lost and confused as he did.\n\u201cLord Hand.\u201d Grazhar stood in the door, a taper in his hand. \u201cThe Green Grace has come. You asked to be told.\u201d\n\u201cShow her in. And light some candles.\u201d\nGalazza Galare was attended by four Pink Graces. An aura of wisdom and dignity seemed to surround her that Ser Barristan could not help but admire. This is a strong woman, and she has been a faithful friend to Daenerys. \u201cLord Hand,\u201d she said, her face hidden behind shimmering green veils. \u201cMay I sit? These bones are old and weary.\u201d\n\u201cGrazhar, a chair for the Green Grace.\u201d The Pink Graces arrayed themselves behind her, with eyes lowered and hands clasped before them. \u201cMay I offer you refreshment?\u201d asked Ser Barristan.\n\u201cThat would be most welcome, Ser Barristan. My throat is dry from talking. A juice, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He beckoned to Kezmya and had her fetch the priestess a goblet of lemon juice, sweetened with honey. To drink it, the priestess had to remove her veil, and Selmy was reminded of just how old she was. Twenty years my elder, or more. \u201cIf the queen were here, I know she would join me in thanking you for all that you have done for us.\u201d\n\u201cHer Magnificence has always been most gracious.\u201d Galazza Galare finished her drink and fastened up her veil again. \u201cHave there been any further tidings of our sweet queen?\u201d\n\u201cNone as yet.\u201d\n\u201cI shall pray for her. And what of King Hizdahr, if I may be so bold? Might I be permitted to see His Radiance?\u201d\n\u201cSoon, I hope. He is unharmed, I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cI am pleased to hear that. The Wise Masters of Yunkai asked after him. You will not be surprised to hear that they wish the noble Hizdahr to be restored at once to his rightful place.\u201d\n\u201cHe shall be, if it can be proved that he did not try to kill our queen. Until such time, Meereen will be ruled by a council of the loyal and just. There is a place for you on that council. I know that you have much to teach us all, Your Benevolence. We need your wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cI fear you flatter me with empty courtesies, Lord Hand,\u201d the Green Grace said. \u201cIf you truly think me wise, heed me now. Release the noble Hizdahr and restore him to his throne.\u201d\n\u201cOnly the queen can do that.\u201d\nBeneath her veils, the Green Grace sighed. \u201cThe peace that we worked so hard to forge flutters like a leaf in an autumn wind. These are dire days. Death stalks our streets, riding the pale mare from thrice-cursed Astapor. Dragons haunt the skies, feasting on the flesh of children. Hundreds are taking ship, sailing for Yunkai, for Tolos, for Qarth, for any refuge that will have them. The pyramid of Hazkar has collapsed into a smoking ruin, and many of that ancient line lie dead beneath its blackened stones. The pyramids of Uhlez and Yherizan have become the lairs of monsters, their masters homeless beggars. My people have lost all hope and turned against the gods themselves, giving over their nights to drunkenness and fornication.\u201d\n\u201cAnd murder. The Sons of the Harpy slew thirty in the night.\u201d\n\u201cI grieve to hear this. All the more reason to free the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq, who stopped such killings once.\u201d\nAnd how did he accomplish that, unless he is himself the Harpy? \u201cHer Grace gave her hand to Hizdahr zo Loraq, made him her king and consort, restored the mortal art as he beseeched her. In return he gave her poisoned locusts.\u201d\n\u201cIn return he gave her peace. Do not cast it away, ser, I beg you. Peace is the pearl beyond price. Hizdahr is of Loraq. Never would he soil his hands with poison. He is innocent.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d Unless you know the poisoner.\n\u201cThe gods of Ghis have told me.\u201d\n\u201cMy gods are the Seven, and the Seven have been silent on this matter. Your Wisdom, did you present my offer?\u201d\n\u201cTo all the lords and captains of Yunkai, as you commanded me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet I fear you will not like their answer.\u201d\n\u201cThey refused?\u201d\n\u201cThey did. No amount of gold will buy your people back, I was told. Only the blood of dragons may set them free again.\u201d\nIt was the answer Ser Barristan had expected, if not the one that he had hoped for. His mouth tightened.\n\u201cI know these were not the words you wished to hear,\u201d said Galazza Galare. \u201cYet for myself, I understand. These dragons are fell beasts. Yunkai fears them\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and with good cause, you cannot deny. Our histories speak of the dragonlords of dread Valyria and the devastation that they wrought upon the peoples of Old Ghis. Even your own young queen, fair Daenerys who called herself the Mother of Dragons\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we saw her burning, that day in the pit\u00a0\u2026\u00a0even she was not safe from the dragon\u2019s wroth.\u201d\n\u201cHer Grace is not\u00a0\u2026\u00a0she\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0is dead. May the gods grant her sweet sleep.\u201d Tears glistened behind her veils. \u201cLet her dragons die as well.\u201d\nSelmy was groping for an answer when he heard the sound of heavy footsteps. The door burst inward, and Skahaz mo Kandaq stormed in with four Brazen Beasts behind him. When Grazhar tried to block his path, he slammed the boy aside.\nSer Barristan was on his feet at once. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe trebuchets,\u201d the Shavepate growled. \u201cAll six.\u201d\nGalazza Galare rose. \u201cThus does Yunkai make reply to your offers, ser. I warned you that you would not like their answer.\u201d\nThey choose war, then. So be it. Ser Barristan felt oddly relieved. War he understood. \u201cIf they think they will break Meereen by throwing stones\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot stones.\u201d The old woman\u2019s voice was full of grief, of fear. \u201cCorpses.\u201d",

      "content": "DAENERYS\nThe hill was a stony island in a sea of green.\nIt took Dany half the morning to climb down. By the time she reached the bottom she was winded. Her muscles ached, and she felt as if she had the beginnings of a fever. The rocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she decided as she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a pale milky fluid was leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.\nThe hill loomed larger down here. Dany had taken to calling it Dragonstone, after the ancient citadel where she\u2019d been born. She had no memories of that Dragonstone, but she would not soon forget this one. Scrub grass and thorny bushes covered its lower slopes; higher up a jagged tangle of bare rock thrust steep and sudden into the sky. There, amidst broken boulders, razor-sharp ridges, and needle spires, Drogon made his lair inside a shallow cave. He had dwelt there for some time, Dany had realized when she first saw the hill. The air smelled of ash, every rock and tree in sight was scorched and blackened, the ground strewn with burned and broken bones, yet it had been home to him.\nDany knew the lure of home.\nTwo days ago, climbing on a spire of rock, she had spied water to the south, a slender thread that glittered briefly as the sun was going down. A stream, Dany decided. Small, but it would lead her to a larger stream, and that stream would flow into some little river, and all the rivers in this part of the world were vassals of the Skahazadhan. Once she found the Skahazadhan she need only follow it downstream to Slaver\u2019s Bay.\nShe would sooner have returned to Meereen on dragon\u2019s wings, to be sure. But that was a desire Drogon did not seem to share.\nThe dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon\u2019s back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse\u2019s first instinct is to flee from danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon\u2019s right side he veered right, for a dragon\u2019s first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.\nAnd no matter how far the dragon flew each day, come nightfall some instinct drew him home to Dragonstone. His home, not mine. Her home was back in Meereen, with her husband and her lover. That was where she belonged, surely.\nKeep walking. If I look back I am lost.\nMemories walked with her. Clouds seen from above. Horses small as ants thundering through the grass. A silver moon, almost close enough to touch. Rivers running bright and blue below, glimmering in the sun. Will I ever see such sights again? On Drogon\u2019s back she felt whole. Up in the sky the woes of this world could not touch her. How could she abandon that?\nIt was time, though. A girl might spend her life at play, but she was a woman grown, a queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon bench and the arms of her noble husband.\nHizdahr, of the tepid kisses.\nThe sun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany\u2019s clothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth. One of her sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she had left the other up by Drogon\u2019s cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than half-shod. Her tokar and veils she had abandoned in the pit, and her linen undertunic had never been made to withstand the hot days and cold nights of the Dothraki sea. Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off the hem to make a bandage for her shin. I must look a ragged thing, and starved, she thought, but if the days stay warm, I will not freeze.\nHers had been a lonely sojourn, and for most of it she had been hurt and hungry\u00a0\u2026\u00a0yet despite it all she had been strangely happy here. A few aches, an empty belly, chills by night\u00a0\u2026\u00a0what does it matter when you can fly? I would do it all again.\nJhiqui and Irri would be waiting atop her pyramid back in Meereen, she told herself. Her sweet scribe Missandei as well, and all her little pages. They would bring her food, and she could bathe in the pool beneath the persimmon tree. It would be good to feel clean again. Dany did not need a glass to know that she was filthy.\nShe was hungry too. One morning she had found some wild onions growing halfway down the south slope, and later that same day a leafy reddish vegetable that might have been some queer sort of cabbage. Whatever it was, it had not made her sick. Aside from that, and one fish that she had caught in the spring-fed pool outside of Drogon\u2019s cave, she had survived as best she could on the dragon\u2019s leavings, on burned bones and chunks of smoking meat, half-charred and half-raw. She needed more, she knew. One day she kicked at a cracked sheep\u2019s skull with the side of a bare foot and sent it bouncing over the edge of the hill. And as she watched it tumble down the steep slope toward the sea of grass, she realized she must follow.\nDany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt warm between her toes. The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she tapped her thigh with the pitmaster\u2019s whip. That, and the rags on her back, were all she had taken from Meereen.\nThough she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter would not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would come brown. The grass was dying.\nDaenerys Targaryen was no stranger to the Dothraki sea, the great ocean of grass that stretched from the forest of Qohor to the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World. She had seen it first when she was still a girl, newly wed to Khal Drogo and on her way to Vaes Dothrak to be presented to the crones of the dosh khaleen. The sight of all that grass stretching out before her had taken her breath away. The sky was blue, the grass was green, and I was full of hope. Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear. She\u2019d had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those half-remembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been as happy.\nBut in the Red Waste, all her joy had turned to ashes. Her sun-and-stars had fallen from his horse, the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had murdered Rhaego in her womb, and Dany had smothered the empty shell of Khal Drogo with her own two hands. Afterward Drogo\u2019s great khalasar had shattered. Ko Pono named himself Khal Pono and took many riders with him, and many slaves as well. Ko Jhaqo named himself Khal Jhaqo and rode off with even more. Mago, his bloodrider, raped and murdered Eroeh, a girl Daenerys had once saved from him. Only the birth of her dragons amidst the fire and smoke of Khal Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre had spared Dany herself from being dragged back to Vaes Dothrak to live out the remainder of her days amongst the crones of the dosh khaleen.\nThe fire burned away my hair, but elsewise it did not touch me. It had been the same in Daznak\u2019s Pit. That much she could recall, though much of what followed was a haze. So many people, screaming and shoving. She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon\u2019s scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman\u2019s face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.\nThen all of that had faded, the sounds dwindling, the people shrinking, the spears and arrows falling back beneath them as Drogon clawed his way into the sky. Up and up and up he\u2019d borne her, high above the pyramids and pits, his wings outstretched to catch the warm air rising from the city\u2019s sun baked bricks. If I fall and die, it will still have been worth it, she had thought.\nNorth they flew, beyond the river, Drogon gliding on torn and tattered wings through clouds that whipped by like the banners of some ghostly army. Dany glimpsed the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay and the old Valyrian road that ran beside it through sand and desolation until it vanished in the west. The road home. Then there was nothing beneath them but grass rippling in the wind.\nWas that first flight a thousand years ago? Sometimes it seemed as if it must be.\nThe sun grew hotter as it rose, and before long her head was pounding. Dany\u2019s hair was growing out again, but slowly. \u201cI need a hat,\u201d she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for herself, weaving stalks of grass together as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but either she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary skill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. Try again, she told herself. You will do better the next time. You are the blood of the dragon, you can make a hat. She tried and tried, but her last attempt had been no more successful than her first.\nIt was afternoon by the time Dany found the stream she had glimpsed atop the hill. It was a rill, a rivulet, a trickle, no wider than her arm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and her arm had grown thinner every day she spent on Dragonstone. Dany scooped up a handful of water and splashed it on her face. When she cupped her hands, her knuckles squished in the mud at the bottom of the stream. She might have wished for colder, clearer water\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but no, if she were going to pin her hopes on wishes, she would wish for rescue.\nShe still clung to the hope that someone would come after her. Ser Barristan might come seeking her; he was the first of her Queensguard, sworn to defend her life with his own. And her bloodriders were no strangers to the Dothraki sea, and their lives were bound to her own. Her husband, the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq, might dispatch searchers. And Daario\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Dany pictured him riding toward her through the tall grass, smiling, his golden tooth gleaming with the last light of the setting sun.\nOnly Daario had been given to the Yunkai\u2019i, a hostage to ensure no harm came to the Yunkish captains. Daario and Hero, Jhogo and Groleo, and three of Hizdahr\u2019s kin. By now, surely, all of her hostages would have been released. But\u00a0\u2026\nShe wondered if her captain\u2019s blades still hung upon the wall beside her bed, waiting for Daario to return and claim them. \u201cI will leave my girls with you,\u201d he had said. \u201cKeep them safe for me, beloved.\u201d And she wondered how much the Yunkai\u2019i knew about what her captain meant to her. She had asked Ser Barristan that question the afternoon the hostages went forth. \u201cThey will have heard the talk,\u201d he had replied. \u201cNaharis may even have boasted of Your Grace\u2019s\u00a0\u2026\u00a0of your great\u00a0\u2026\u00a0regard\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for him. If you will forgive my saying so, modesty is not one of the captain\u2019s virtues. He takes great pride in his\u00a0\u2026\u00a0his swordsmanship.\u201d\nHe boasts of bedding me, you mean. But Daario would not have been so foolish as to make such a boast amongst her enemies. It makes no matter. By now the Yunkai\u2019i will be marching home. That was why she had done all that she had done. For peace.\nShe turned back the way she\u2019d come, to where Dragonstone rose above the grasslands like a clenched fist. It looks so close. I\u2019ve been walking for hours, yet it still looks as if I could reach out and touch it. It was not too late to go back. There were fish in the spring-fed pool by Drogon\u2019s cave. She had caught one her first day there, she might catch more. And there would be scraps, charred bones with bits of flesh still on them, the remnants of Drogon\u2019s kills.\nNo, Dany told herself. If I look back I am lost. She might live for years amongst the sunbaked rocks of Dragonstone, riding Drogon by day and gnawing at his leavings every evenfall as the great grass sea turned from gold to orange, but that was not the life she had been born to. So once again she turned her back upon the distant hill and closed her ears to the song of flight and freedom that the wind sang as it played amongst the hill\u2019s stony ridges. The stream was trickling south by southeast, as near as she could tell. She followed it. Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.\nThe hours passed slowly. The stream bent this way and that, and Dany followed, beating time upon her leg with the whip, trying not to think about how far she had to go, or the pounding in her head, or her empty belly. Take one step. Take the next. Another step. Another. What else could she do?\nIt was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished between her toes. Insects buzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging midges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed on her arms. Once she came upon a rat drinking from the stream, but it fled when she appeared, scurrying between the stalks to vanish in the high grass. Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I\u2019ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. \u201cMen are mad and gods are madder,\u201d she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.\nThrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have been an eagle, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by now, even when he was no more than a speck. The second time he passed before the sun, his black wings spread, and the world darkened. The last time he flew right above her, so close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in the east. Just as well, she thought.\nEvening took her almost unawares. As the sun was gilding the distant spires of Dragonstone, Dany stumbled onto a low stone wall, overgrown and broken. Perhaps it had been part of a temple, or the hall of the village lord. More ruins lay beyond it\u2014an old well, and some circles in the grass that marked the sites where hovels had once stood. They had been built of mud and straw, she judged, but long years of wind and rain had worn them away to nothing. Dany found eight before the sun went down, but there might have been more farther out, hidden in the grass.\nThe stone wall had endured better than the rest. Though it was nowhere more than three feet high, the angle where it met another, lower wall still offered some shelter from the elements, and night was coming on fast. Dany wedged herself into that corner, making a nest of sorts by tearing up handfuls of the grass that grew around the ruins. She was very tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a matched set upon her pinky toes. It must be from the way I walk, she thought, giggling.\nAs the world darkened, Dany settled in and closed her eyes, but sleep refused to come. The night was cold, the ground hard, her belly empty. She found herself thinking of Meereen, of Daario, her love, and Hizdahr, her husband, of Irri and Jhiqui and sweet Missandei, Ser Barristan and Reznak and Skahaz Shavepate. Do they fear me dead? I flew off on a dragon\u2019s back. Will they think he ate me? She wondered if Hizdahr was still king. His crown had come from her, could he hold it in her absence? He wanted Drogon dead. I heard him. \u201cKill it,\u201d he screamed, \u201ckill the beast,\u201d and the look upon his face was lustful. And Strong Belwas had been on his knees, heaving and shuddering. Poison. It had to be poison. The honeyed locusts. Hizdahr urged them on me, but Belwas ate them all. She had made Hizdahr her king, taken him into her bed, opened the fighting pits for him, he had no reason to want her dead. Yet who else could it have been? Reznak, her perfumed seneschal? The Yunkai\u2019i? The Sons of the Harpy?\nOff in the distance, a wolf howled. The sound made her feel sad and lonely, but no less hungry. As the moon rose above the grasslands, Dany slipped at last into a restless sleep.\nShe dreamed. All her cares fell away from her, and all her pains as well, and she seemed to float upward into the sky. She was flying once again, spinning, laughing, dancing, as the stars wheeled around her and whispered secrets in her ear. \u201cTo go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d\n\u201cQuaithe?\u201d Dany called. \u201cWhere are you, Quaithe?\u201d\nThen she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.\n\u201cRemember who you are, Daenerys,\u201d the stars whispered in a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cThe dragons know. Do you?\u201d\nThe next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants crawling on her arms and legs and face. When she realized what they were, she kicked aside the stalks of dry brown grass that had served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet. She had bites all over her, little red bumps, itchy and inflamed. Where did all the ants come from? Dany brushed them from her arms and legs and belly. She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp where her hair had burned away, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down the back of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare feet. There were so many\u00a0\u2026\nIt turned out that their anthill was on the other side of her wall. She wondered how the ants had managed to climb over it and find her. To them these tumbledown stones must loom as huge as the Wall of Westeros. The biggest wall in all the world, her brother Viserys used to say, as proud as if he\u2019d built it himself.\nViserys told her tales of knights so poor that they had to sleep beneath the ancient hedges that grew along the byways of the Seven Kingdoms. Dany would have given much and more for a nice thick hedge. Preferably one without an anthill.\nThe sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. Perhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down on me. Dragonstone was still visible above the grasslands. It looks so close. I must be leagues away by now, but it looks as if I could be back in an hour. She wanted to lie back down, close her eyes, and give herself up to sleep. No. I must keep going. The stream. Just follow the stream.\nDany took a moment to make certain of her directions. It would not do to walk the wrong way and lose her stream. \u201cMy friend,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cIf I stay close to my friend I won\u2019t get lost.\u201d She would have slept beside the water if she dared, but there were animals who came down to the stream to drink at night. She had seen their tracks. Dany would make a poor meal for a wolf or lion, but even a poor meal was better than none.\nOnce she was certain which way was south, she counted off her paces. The stream appeared at eight. Dany cupped her hands to drink. The water made her belly cramp, but cramps were easier to bear than thirst. She had no other drink but the morning dew that glistened on the tall grass, and no food at all unless she cared to eat the grass. I could try eating ants. The little yellow ones were too small to provide much in the way of nourishment, but there were red ants in the grass, and those were bigger. \u201cI am lost at sea,\u201d she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, \u201cso perhaps I\u2019ll find some crabs, or a nice fat fish.\u201d Her whip slapped softly against her thigh, wap wap wap. One step at a time, and the stream would see her home.\nJust past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its twisted limbs covered with hard green berries. Dany squinted at them suspiciously, then plucked one from a branch and nibbled at it. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that seemed familiar to her. \u201cIn the khalasar, they used berries like these to flavor roasts,\u201d she decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain of it. Her belly rumbled, and Dany found herself picking berries with both hands and tossing them into her mouth.\nAn hour later, her stomach began to cramp so badly that she could not go on. She spent the rest of that day retching up green slime. If I stay here, I will die. I may be dying now. Would the horse god of the Dothraki part the grass and claim her for his starry khalasar, so she might ride the nightlands with Khal Drogo? In Westeros the dead of House Targaryen were given to the flames, but who would light her pyre here? My flesh will feed the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my womb. Her eyes went back to Dragonstone. It looked smaller. She could see smoke rising from its wind-carved summit, miles away. Drogon has returned from hunting.\nSunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water. The more she drank, the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew, and her thirst sent her crawling to the stream to suck up more water. When she closed her eyes at last, Dany did not know whether she would be strong enough to open them again.\nShe dreamt of her dead brother.\nViserys looked just as he had the last time she\u2019d seen him. His mouth was twisted in anguish, his hair was burnt, and his face was black and smoking where the molten gold had run down across his brow and cheeks and into his eyes.\n\u201cYou are dead,\u201d Dany said.\nMurdered. Though his lips never moved, somehow she could hear his voice, whispering in her ear. You never mourned me, sister. It is hard to die unmourned.\n\u201cI loved you once.\u201d\nOnce, he said, so bitterly it made her shudder. You were supposed to be my wife, to bear me children with silver hair and purple eyes, to keep the blood of the dragon pure. I took care of you. I taught you who you were. I fed you. I sold our mother\u2019s crown to keep you fed.\n\u201cYou hurt me. You frightened me.\u201d\nOnly when you woke the dragon. I loved you.\n\u201cYou sold me. You betrayed me.\u201d\nNo. You were the betrayer. You turned against me, against your own blood. They cheated me. Your horsey husband and his stinking savages. They were cheats and liars. They promised me a golden crown and gave me this. He touched the molten gold that was creeping down his face, and smoke rose from his finger.\n\u201cYou could have had your crown,\u201d Dany told him. \u201cMy sun-and-stars would have won it for you if only you had waited.\u201d\nI waited long enough. I waited my whole life. I was their king, their rightful king. They laughed at me.\n\u201cYou should have stayed in Pentos with Magister Illyrio. Khal Drogo had to present me to the dosh khaleen, but you did not have to ride with us. That was your choice. Your mistake.\u201d\nDo you want to wake the dragon, you stupid little whore? Drogo\u2019s khalasar was mine. I bought them from him, a hundred thousand screamers. I paid for them with your maidenhead.\n\u201cYou never understood. Dothraki do not buy and sell. They give gifts and receive them. If you had waited\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nI did wait. For my crown, for my throne, for you. All those years, and all I ever got was a pot of molten gold. Why did they give the dragon\u2019s eggs to you? They should have been mine. If I\u2019d had a dragon, I would have taught the world the meaning of our words. Viserys began to laugh, until his jaw fell away from his face, smoking, and blood and molten gold ran from his mouth.\nWhen she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood.\nFor a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I\u2019m so tired. She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep. Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass, and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.\nIf she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was only woman\u2019s blood. The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. \u201cI am the blood of the dragon,\u201d she told the grass, aloud.\nOnce, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.\n\u201cDrogon killed a little girl. Her name was\u00a0\u2026\u00a0her name\u00a0\u2026\u201d Dany could not recall the child\u2019s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. \u201cI will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.\u201d\nAye, the grass said, but you turned against your children.\nHer belly was empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping had grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels. She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of dawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her face, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic was stained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it\u2019s only my moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. Could it be the water? If it was the water, she was doomed. She had to drink or die of thirst.\n\u201cWalk,\u201d Dany commanded herself. \u201cFollow the stream and it will take you to the Skahazadhan. That\u2019s where Daario will find you.\u201d But it took all her strength just to get back to her feet, and when she did all she could do was stand there, fevered and bleeding. She raised her eyes to the empty blue sky, squinting at the sun. Half the morning gone already, she realized, dismayed. She made herself take a step, and then another, and then she was walking once again, following the little stream.\nThe day grew warmer, and the sun beat down upon her head and the burnt remnants of her hair. Water splashed against the soles of her feet. She was walking in the stream. How long had she been doing that? The soft brown mud felt good between her toes and helped to soothe her blisters. In the stream or out of it, I must keep walking. Water flows downhill. The stream will take me to the river, and the river will take me home.\nExcept it wouldn\u2019t, not truly.\nMeereen was not her home, and never would be. It was a city of strange men with strange gods and stranger hair, of slavers wrapped in fringed tokars, where grace was earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always be the Harpy\u2019s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.\nNever, said the grass, in the gruff tones of Jorah Mormont. You were warned, Your Grace. Let this city be, I said. Your war is in Westeros, I told you.\nThe voice was no more than a whisper, yet somehow Dany felt that he was walking just behind her. My bear, she thought, my old sweet bear, who loved me and betrayed me. She had missed him so. She wanted to see his ugly face, to wrap her arms around him and press herself against his chest, but she knew that if she turned around Ser Jorah would be gone. \u201cI am dreaming,\u201d she said. \u201cA waking dream, a walking dream. I am alone and lost.\u201d\nLost, because you lingered, in a place that you were never meant to be, murmured Ser Jorah, as softly as the wind. Alone, because you sent me from your side.\n\u201cYou betrayed me. You informed on me, for gold.\u201d\nFor home. Home was all I ever wanted.\n\u201cAnd me. You wanted me.\u201d Dany had seen it in his eyes.\nI did, the grass whispered, sadly.\n\u201cYou kissed me. I never said you could, but you did. You sold me to my enemies, but you meant it when you kissed me.\u201d\nI gave you good counsel. Save your spears and swords for the Seven Kingdoms, I told you. Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and go west, I said. You would not listen.\n\u201cI had to take Meereen or see my children starve along the march.\u201d Dany could still see the trail of corpses she had left behind her crossing the Red Waste. It was not a sight she wished to see again. \u201cI had to take Meereen to feed my people.\u201d\nYou took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered.\n\u201cTo be a queen.\u201d\nYou are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros.\n\u201cIt is such a long way,\u201d she complained. \u201cI was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.\u201d\nNo. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.\n\u201cFire and Blood,\u201d Daenerys told the swaying grass.\nA stone turned under her foot. She stumbled to one knee and cried out in pain, hoping against hope that her bear would gather her up and help her to her feet. When she turned her head to look for him, all she saw was trickling brown water\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and the grass, still moving slightly. The wind, she told herself, the wind shakes the stalks and makes them sway. Only no wind was blowing. The sun was overhead, the world still and hot. Midges swarmed in the air, and a dragonfly floated over the stream, darting here and there. And the grass was moving when it had no cause to move.\nShe fumbled in the water, found a stone the size of her fist, pulled it from the mud. It was a poor weapon but better than an empty hand. From the corner of her eye Dany saw the grass move again, off to her right. The grass swayed and bowed low, as if before a king, but no king appeared to her. The world was green and empty. The world was green and silent. The world was yellow, dying. I should get up, she told herself. I have to walk. I have to follow the stream.\nThrough the grass came a soft silvery tinkling.\nBells, Dany thought, smiling, remembering Khal Drogo, her sun-and-stars, and the bells he braided into his hair. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when my womb quickens again and I bear a living child, Khal Drogo will return to me.\nBut none of those things had happened. Bells, Dany thought again. Her bloodriders had found her. \u201cAggo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJhogo. Rakharo.\u201d Might Daario have come with them?\nThe green sea opened. A rider appeared. His braid was black and shiny, his skin as dark as burnished copper, his eyes the shape of bitter almonds. Bells sang in his hair. He wore a medallion belt and painted vest, with an arakh on one hip and a whip on the other. A hunting bow and a quiver of arrows were slung from his saddle.\nOne rider, and alone. A scout. He was one who rode before the khalasar to find the game and the good green grass, and sniff out foes wherever they might hide. If he found her there, he would kill her, rape her, or enslave her. At best, he would send her back to the crones of the dosh khaleen, where good khaleesi were supposed to go when their khals had died.\nHe did not see her, though. The grass concealed her, and he was looking elsewhere. Dany followed his eyes, and there the shadow flew, with wings spread wide. The dragon was a mile off, and yet the scout stood frozen until his stallion began to whicker in fear. Then he woke as if from a dream, wheeled his mount about, and raced off through the tall grass at a gallop.\nDany watched him go. When the sound of his hooves had faded away to silence, she began to shout. She called until her voice was hoarse\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and Drogon came, snorting plumes of smoke. The grass bowed down before him. Dany leapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. \u201cTo go forward I must go back,\u201d she said. Her bare legs tightened around the dragon\u2019s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he smelled the rider\u2019s fear.\nIn a dozen heartbeats they were past the Dothraki, as he galloped far below. To the right and left, Dany glimpsed places where the grass was burned and ashen. Drogon has come this way before, she realized. Like a chain of grey islands, the marks of his hunting dotted the green grass sea.\nA vast herd of horses appeared below them. There were riders too, a score or more, but they turned and fled at the first sight of the dragon. The horses broke and ran when the shadow fell upon them, racing through the grass until their sides were white with foam, tearing the ground with their hooves\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but as swift as they were, they could not fly. Soon one horse began to lag behind the others. The dragon descended on him, roaring, and all at once the poor beast was aflame, yet somehow he kept on running, screaming with every step, until Drogon landed on him and broke his back. Dany clutched the dragon\u2019s neck with all her strength to keep from sliding off.\nThe carcass was too heavy for him to bear back to his lair, so Drogon consumed his kill there, tearing at the charred flesh as the grasses burned around them, the air thick with drifting smoke and the smell of burnt horsehair. Dany, starved, slid off his back and ate with him, ripping chunks of smoking meat from the dead horse with bare, burned hands. In Meereen I was a queen in silk, nibbling on stuffed dates and honeyed lamb, she remembered. What would my noble husband think if he could see me now? Hizdahr would be horrified, no doubt. But Daario\u00a0\u2026\nDaario would laugh, carve off a hunk of horsemeat with his arakh, and squat down to eat beside her.\nAs the western sky turned the color of a blood bruise, she heard the sound of approaching horses. Dany rose, wiped her hands on her ragged undertunic, and went to stand beside her dragon.\nThat was how Khal Jhaqo found her, when half a hundred mounted warriors emerged from the drifting smoke.",

      "content": "EPILOGUE\nI am no traitor,\u201d the Knight of Griffin\u2019s Roost declared. \u201cI am King Tommen\u2019s man, and yours.\u201d\nA steady drip-drip-drip punctuated his words, as snowmelt ran off his cloak to puddle on the floor. The snow had been falling on King\u2019s Landing most of the night; outside the drifts were ankle deep. Ser Kevan Lannister pulled his cloak about himself more closely. \u201cSo you say, ser. Words are wind.\u201d\n\u201cThen let me prove the truth of them with my sword.\u201d The light of the torches made a fiery blaze of Ronnet Connington\u2019s long red hair and beard. \u201cSend me against my uncle, and I will bring you back his head, and the head of this false dragon too.\u201d\nLannister spearmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms stood along the west wall of the throne room. Tyrell guards in green cloaks faced them from the opposite wall. The chill in the throne room was palpable. Though neither Queen Cersei nor Queen Margaery was amongst them, their presence could be felt poisoning the air, like ghosts at a feast.\nBehind the table where the five members of the king\u2019s small council were seated, the Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades half-shrouded in shadow. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the shoulder blades. It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there, bleeding from some fresh cut, glowering down. But today the throne was empty. He had seen no reason for Tommen to join them. Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother. The Seven only knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei\u2019s trial\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and possibly her execution.\nMace Tyrell was speaking. \u201cWe shall deal with your uncle and his feigned boy in due time.\u201d The new King\u2019s Hand was seated on an oaken throne carved in the shape of a hand, an absurd vanity his lordship had produced the day Ser Kevan agreed to grant him the office he coveted. \u201cYou will bide here until we are ready to march. Then you shall have the chance to prove your loyalty.\u201d\nSer Kevan took no issue with that. \u201cEscort Ser Ronnet back to his chambers,\u201d he said. And see that he remains there went unspoken. However loud his protestations, the Knight of Griffin\u2019s Roost remained suspect. Supposedly the sellswords who had landed in the south were being led by one of his own blood.\nAs the echoes of Connington\u2019s footsteps faded away, Grand Maester Pycelle gave a ponderous shake of his head. \u201cHis uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon.\u201d\nThat is how it is when a man grows as old as Pycelle. Everything you see or hear reminds you of something you saw or heard when you were young. \u201cHow many men-at-arms accompanied Ser Ronnet to the city?\u201d Ser Kevan asked.\n\u201cTwenty,\u201d said Lord Randyll Tarly, \u201cand most of them Gregor Clegane\u2019s old lot. Your nephew Jaime gave them to Connington. To rid himself of them, I\u2019d wager. They had not been in Maidenpool a day before one killed a man and another was accused of rape. I had to hang the one and geld the other. If it were up to me, I would send them all to the Night\u2019s Watch, and Connington with them. The Wall is where such scum belong.\u201d\n\u201cA dog takes after its master,\u201d declared Mace Tyrell. \u201cBlack cloaks would suit them, I agree. I will not suffer such men in the city watch.\u201d A hundred of his own Highgarden men had been added to the gold cloaks, yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any balancing infusion of westermen.\nThe more I give him, the more he wants. Kevan Lannister was beginning to understand why Cersei had grown so resentful of the Tyrells. But this was not the moment to provoke an open quarrel. Randyll Tarly and Mace Tyrell had both brought armies to King\u2019s Landing, whilst the best part of the strength of House Lannister remained in the riverlands, fast melting away. \u201cThe Mountain\u2019s men were always fighters,\u201d he said in a conciliatory tone, \u201cand we may have need of every sword against these sellswords. If this truly is the Golden Company, as Qyburn\u2019s whisperers insist\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCall them what you will,\u201d said Randyll Tarly. \u201cThey are still no more than adventurers.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Ser Kevan said. \u201cBut the longer we ignore these adventurers, the stronger they grow. We have had a map prepared, a map of the incursions. Grand Maester?\u201d\nThe map was beautiful, painted by a master\u2019s hand on a sheet of the finest vellum, so large it covered the table. \u201cHere.\u201d Pycelle pointed with a spotted hand. Where the sleeve of his robe rode up, a flap of pale flesh could be seen dangling beneath his forearm. \u201cHere and here. All along the coast, and on the islands. Tarth, the Stepstones, even Estermont. And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm\u2019s End.\u201d\n\u201cIf it is Jon Connington,\u201d said Randyll Tarly.\n\u201cStorm\u2019s End.\u201d Lord Mace Tyrell grunted the words. \u201cHe cannot take Storm\u2019s End. Not if he were Aegon the Conqueror. And if he does, what of it? Stannis holds it now. Let the castle pass from one pretender to another, why should that trouble us? I shall recapture it after my daughter\u2019s innocence is proved.\u201d\nHow can you recapture it when you have never captured it to begin with? \u201cI understand, my lord, but\u2014\u201d\nTyrell did not let him finish. \u201cThese charges against my daughter are filthy lies. I ask again, why must we play out this mummer\u2019s farce? Have King Tommen declare my daughter innocent, ser, and put an end to the foolishness here and now.\u201d\nDo that, and the whispers will follow Margaery the rest of her life. \u201cNo man doubts your daughter\u2019s innocence, my lord,\u201d Ser Kevan lied, \u201cbut His High Holiness insists upon a trial.\u201d\nLord Randyll snorted. \u201cWhat have we become, when kings and high lords must dance to the twittering of sparrows?\u201d\n\u201cWe have foes on every hand, Lord Tarly,\u201d Ser Kevan reminded him. \u201cStannis in the north, ironmen in the west, sellswords in the south. Defy the High Septon, and we will have blood running in the gutters of King\u2019s Landing as well. If we are seen to be going against the gods, it will only drive the pious into the arms of one or the other of these would-be usurpers.\u201d\nMace Tyrell remained unmoved. \u201cOnce Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the seas, my sons will retake the Shields. The snows will do for Stannis, or Bolton will. As for Connington\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf it is him,\u201d Lord Randyll said.\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0as for Connington,\u201d Tyrell repeated, \u201cwhat victories has he ever won that we should fear him? He could have ended Robert\u2019s Rebellion at Stoney Sept. He failed. Just as the Golden Company has always failed. Some may rush to join them, aye. The realm is well rid of such fools.\u201d\nSer Kevan wished that he could share his certainty. He had known Jon Connington, slightly\u2014a proud youth, the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, competing for his royal favor. Arrogant, but able and energetic. That, and his skill at arms, was why Mad King Aerys had named him Hand. Old Lord Merryweather\u2019s inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and spread, and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert\u2019s own youth and vigor. \u201cToo soon,\u201d Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king\u2019s choice had reached Casterly Rock. \u201cConnington is too young, too bold, too eager for glory.\u201d\nThe Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that. Ser Kevan had expected that afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the Mad King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead, and paid for it with life and crown. That was all so long ago, though. If this is indeed Jon Connington, he will be a different man. Older, harder, more seasoned\u00a0\u2026\u00a0more dangerous. \u201cConnington may have more than the Golden Company. It is said he has a Targaryen pretender.\u201d\n\u201cA feigned boy is what he has,\u201d said Randyll Tarly.\n\u201cThat may be. Or not.\u201d Kevan Lannister had been here, in this very hall when Tywin had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar\u2019s children at the foot of the Iron Throne, wrapped up in crimson cloaks. The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys, but the boy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a faceless horror of bone and brain and gore, a few hanks of fair hair. None of us looked long. Tywin said that it was Prince Aegon, and we took him at his word. \u201cWe have these tales coming from the east as well. A second Targaryen, and one whose blood no man can question. Daenerys Stormborn.\u201d\n\u201cAs mad as her father,\u201d declared Lord Mace Tyrell.\nThat would be the same father that Highgarden and House Tyrell supported to the bitter end and well beyond. \u201cMad she may be,\u201d Ser Kevan said, \u201cbut with so much smoke drifting west, surely there must be some fire burning in the east.\u201d\nGrand Maester Pycelle bobbed his head. \u201cDragons. These same stories have reached Oldtown. Too many to discount. A silver-haired queen with three dragons.\u201d\n\u201cAt the far end of the world,\u201d said Mace Tyrell. \u201cQueen of Slaver\u2019s Bay, aye. She is welcome to it.\u201d\n\u201cOn that we can agree,\u201d Ser Kevan said, \u201cbut the girl is of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his, feigned or no\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys Stormborn can come west.\u201d\nMace Tyrell crossed his arms. \u201cI mean to do just that, ser. After the trials.\u201d\n\u201cSellswords fight for coin,\u201d declared Grand Maester Pycelle. \u201cWith enough gold, we might persuade the Golden Company to hand over Lord Connington and the pretender.\u201d\n\u201cAye, if we had gold,\u201d Ser Harys Swyft said. \u201cAlas, my lords, our vaults contain only rats and roaches. I have written again to the Myrish bankers. If they will agree to make good the crown\u2019s debt to the Braavosi and extend us a new loan, mayhaps we will not have to raise the taxes. Elsewise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,\u201d said Ser Kevan. \u201cTry them.\u201d The Pentoshi were even less like to be of help than the Myrish money changers, but the effort must be made. Unless a new source of coin could be found, or the Iron Bank persuaded to relent, he would have no choice but to pay the crown\u2019s debts with Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling with rebellion. Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny, and would bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper. \u201cIf that fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the Iron Bank yourself.\u201d\nSer Harys quailed. \u201cMust I?\u201d\n\u201cYou are the master of coin,\u201d Lord Randyll said sharply.\n\u201cI am.\u201d The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft\u2019s chin quivered in outrage. \u201cMust I remind my lord, this trouble is not of my doing? And not all of us have had the opportunity to refill our coffers with the plunder of Maidenpool and Dragonstone.\u201d\n\u201cI resent your implication, Swyft,\u201d Mace Tyrell said, bristling. \u201cNo wealth was found on Dragonstone, I promise you. My son\u2019s men have searched every inch of that damp and dreary island and turned up not so much as a single gemstone or speck of gold. Nor any sign of this fabled hoard of dragon eggs.\u201d\nKevan Lannister had seen Dragonstone with his own eyes. He doubted very much that Loras Tyrell had searched every inch of that ancient stronghold. The Valyrians had raised it, after all, and all their works stank of sorcery. And Ser Loras was young, prone to all the rash judgments of youth, and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides. But it would not do to remind Tyrell that his favorite son was fallible. \u201cIf there was wealth on Dragonstone, Stannis would have found it,\u201d he declared. \u201cLet us move along, my lords. We have two queens to try for high treason, you may recall. My niece has elected trial by battle, she informs me. Ser Robert Strong will champion her.\u201d\n\u201cThe silent giant.\u201d Lord Randyll grimaced.\n\u201cTell me, ser, where did this man come from?\u201d demanded Mace Tyrell. \u201cWhy have we never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not show his face, he is never seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?\u201d\nWe do not even know if he\u2019s alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food nor drink, and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy. Why should he? Dead men do not shit. Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever the face hidden behind Strong\u2019s helm, it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his niece\u2019s only hope. And pray that he is as formidable as he appears.\nBut Mace Tyrell could not seem to see beyond the threat to his own daughter. \u201cHis Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard,\u201d Ser Kevan reminded him, \u201cand Qyburn vouches for the man as well. Be that as it may, we need Ser Robert to prevail, my lords. If my niece is proved guilty of these treasons, the legitimacy of her children will be called into question. If Tommen ceases to be a king, Margaery will cease to be a queen.\u201d He let Tyrell chew on that a moment. \u201cWhatever Cersei may have done, she is still a daughter of the Rock, of mine own blood. I will not let her die a traitor\u2019s death, but I have made sure to draw her fangs. All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men. In place of her former ladies-in-waiting, she will henceforth be attended by a septa and three novices selected by the High Septon. She is to have no further voice in the governance of the realm, nor in Tommen\u2019s education. I mean to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial and see that she remains there. Let that suffice.\u201d\nThe rest he left unsaid. Cersei was soiled goods now, her power at an end. Every baker\u2019s boy and beggar in the city had seen her in her shame and every tart and tanner from Flea Bottom to Pisswater Bend had gazed upon her nakedness, their eager eyes crawling over her breasts and belly and woman\u2019s parts. No queen could expect to rule again after that. In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen, the next thing to a goddess; naked, she was only human, an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and teats that had begun to sag\u00a0\u2026\u00a0as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to their husbands and lovers. Better to live shamed than die proud, Ser Kevan told himself. \u201cMy niece will make no further mischief,\u201d he promised Mace Tyrell. \u201cYou have my word on that, my lord.\u201d\nTyrell gave a grudging nod. \u201cAs you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith, so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.\u201d\nIf your daughter is as innocent as you\u2019d have us believe, why must you have your army present when she faces her accusers? Ser Kevan might have asked. \u201cSoon, I hope,\u201d he said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. \u201cIs there aught else?\u201d\nThe Grand Maester consulted his papers. \u201cWe should address the Rosby inheritance. Six claims have been put forth\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can settle Rosby at some later date. What else?\u201d\n\u201cPreparations should be made for Princess Myrcella.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what comes of dealing with the Dornish,\u201d Mace Tyrell said. \u201cSurely a better match can be found for the girl?\u201d\nSuch as your own son Willas, perhaps? Her disfigured by one Dornishman, him crippled by another? \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Ser Kevan said, \u201cbut we have enemies enough without offending Dorne. If Doran Martell were to join his strength to Connington\u2019s in support of this feigned dragon, things could go very ill for all of us.\u201d\n\u201cMayhaps we can persuade our Dornish friends to deal with Lord Connington,\u201d Ser Harys Swyft said with an irritating titter. \u201cThat would save a deal of blood and trouble.\u201d\n\u201cIt would,\u201d Ser Kevan said wearily. Time to put an end to this. \u201cThank you, my lords. Let us convene again five days hence. After Cersei\u2019s trial.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. May the Warrior lend strength to Ser Robert\u2019s arms.\u201d The words were grudging, the dip of the chin Mace Tyrell gave the Lord Regent the most cursory of bows. But it was something, and for that much Ser Kevan Lannister was grateful.\nRandyll Tarly left the hall with his liege lord, their green-cloaked spearmen right behind them. Tarly is the real danger, Ser Kevan reflected as he watched their departure. A narrow man, but iron-willed and shrewd, and as good a soldier as the Reach could boast. But how do I win him to our side?\n\u201cLord Tyrell loves me not,\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle said in gloomy tones when the Hand had departed. \u201cThis matter of the moon tea\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I would never have spoken of such, but the Queen Dowager commanded me! If it please the Lord Regent, I would sleep more soundly if you could lend me some of your guards.\u201d\n\u201cLord Tyrell might take that amiss.\u201d\nSer Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. \u201cI am in need of guards myself. These are perilous times.\u201d\nAye, thought Kevan Lannister, and Pycelle is not the only council member our Hand would like to replace. Mace Tyrell had his own candidate for lord treasurer: his uncle, Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, whom men called Garth the Gross. The last thing I need is another Tyrell on the small council. He was already outnumbered. Ser Harys was his wife\u2019s father, and Pycelle could be counted upon as well. But Tarly was sworn to Highgarden, as was Paxter Redwyne, lord admiral and master of ships, presently sailing his fleet around Dorne to deal with Euron Greyjoy\u2019s ironmen. Once Redwyne returned to King\u2019s Landing, the council would stand at three and three, Lannister and Tyrell.\nThe seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting Myrcella home. The Lady Nym. But no lady, if even half of what Qyburn reports is true. A bastard daughter of the Red Viper, near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly. Ser Kevan had not yet seen fit to inform Mace Tyrell of her coming. The Hand, he knew, would not be pleased. The man we need is Littlefinger. Petyr Baelish had a gift for conjuring dragons from the air.\n\u201cHire the Mountain\u2019s men,\u201d Ser Kevan suggested. \u201cRed Ronnet will have no further use for them.\u201d He did not think that Mace Tyrell would be so clumsy as to try to murder either Pycelle or Swyft, but if guards made them feel safer, let them have guards.\nThe three men walked together from the throne room. Outside the snow was swirling round the outer ward, a caged beast howling to be free. \u201cHave you ever felt such cold?\u201d asked Ser Harys.\n\u201cThe time to speak of the cold,\u201d said Grand Maester Pycelle, \u201cis not when we are standing out in it.\u201d He made his slow way across the outer ward, back to his chambers.\nThe others lingered for a moment on the throne room steps. \u201cI put no faith in these Myrish bankers,\u201d Ser Kevan told his good-father. \u201cYou had best prepare to go to Braavos.\u201d\nSer Harys did not look happy at the prospect. \u201cIf I must. But I say again, this trouble is not of my doing.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It was Cersei who decided that the Iron Bank would wait for their due. Should I send her to Braavos?\u201d\nSer Harys blinked. \u201cHer Grace\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nSer Kevan rescued him. \u201cThat was a jape. A bad one. Go and find a warm fire. I mean to do the same.\u201d He yanked his gloves on and set off across the yard, leaning hard into the wind as his cloak snapped and swirled behind him.\nThe dry moat surrounding Maegor\u2019s Holdfast was three feet deep in snow, the iron spikes that lined it glistening with frost. The only way in or out of Maegor\u2019s was across the drawbridge that spanned that moat. A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted at its far end. Tonight the duty had fallen to Ser Meryn Trant. With Balon Swann hunting the rogue knight Darkstar down in Dorne, Loras Tyrell gravely wounded on Dragonstone, and Jaime vanished in the riverlands, only four of the White Swords remained in King\u2019s Landing, and Ser Kevan had thrown Osmund Kettleblack (and his brother Osfryd) into the dungeon within hours of Cersei\u2019s confessing that she had taken both men as lovers. That left only Trant, the feeble Boros Blount, and Qyburn\u2019s mute monster Robert Strong to protect the young king and royal family.\nI will need to find some new swords for the Kingsguard. Tommen should have seven good knights about him. In the past the Kingsguard had served for life, but that had not stopped Joffrey from dismissing Ser Barristan Selmy to make a place for his dog, Sandor Clegane. Kevan could make use of that precedent. I could put Lancel in a white cloak, he reflected. There is more honor in that than he will ever find in the Warrior\u2019s Sons.\nKevan Lannister hung his snow-sodden cloak inside his solar, pulled off his boots, and commanded his serving man to fetch some fresh wood for his fire. \u201cA cup of mulled wine would go down well,\u201d he said as he settled by the hearth. \u201cSee to it.\u201d\nThe fire soon thawed him, and the wine warmed his insides nicely. It also made him sleepy, so he dare not drink another cup. His day was far from done. He had reports to read, letters to write. And supper with Cersei and the king. His niece had been subdued and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods. The novices who attended her reported that she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in prayer, and the rest in her tub. She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.\nShe will never wash the stain away, no matter how hard she scrubs. Ser Kevan remembered the girl she once had been, so full of life and mischief. And when she\u2019d flowered, ahhhh\u00a0\u2026\u00a0had there ever been a maid so sweet to look upon? If Aerys had agreed to marry her to Rhaegar, how many deaths might have been avoided? Cersei could have given the prince the sons he wanted, lions with purple eyes and silver manes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and with such a wife, Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark. The northern girl had a wild beauty, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never match the rising sun.\nBut it did no good to brood on lost battles and roads not taken. That was a vice of old done men. Rhaegar had wed Elia of Dorne, Lyanna Stark had died, Robert Baratheon had taken Cersei to bride, and here they were. And tonight his own road would take him to his niece\u2019s chambers and face-to-face with Cersei.\nI have no reason to feel guilty, Ser Kevan told himself. Tywin would understand that, surely. It was his daughter who brought shame down on our name, not I. What I did I did for the good of House Lannister.\nIt was not as if his brother had never done the same. In their father\u2019s final years, after their mother\u2019s passing, their sire had taken the comely daughter of a candlemaker as mistress. It was not unknown for a widowed lord to keep a common girl as bedwarmer\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but Lord Tytos soon began seating the woman beside him in the hall, showering her with gifts and honors, even asking her views on matters of state. Within a year she was dismissing servants, ordering about his household knights, even speaking for his lordship when he was indisposed. She grew so influential that it was said about Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her and speak loudly to her lap\u00a0\u2026\u00a0for Tytos Lannister\u2019s ear was between his lady\u2019s legs. She had even taken to wearing their mother\u2019s jewels.\nUntil the day their lord father\u2019s heart had burst in his chest as he was ascending a steep flight of steps to her bed, that is. All the self-seekers who had named themselves her friends and cultivated her favor had abandoned her quickly enough when Tywin had her stripped naked and paraded through Lannisport to the docks, like a common whore. Though no man laid a hand on her, that walk spelled the end of her power. Surely Tywin would never have dreamed that same fate awaited his own golden daughter.\n\u201cIt had to be,\u201d Ser Kevan muttered over the last of his wine. His High Holiness had to be appeased. Tommen needed the Faith behind him in the battles to come. And Cersei\u00a0\u2026\u00a0the golden child had grown into a vain, foolish, greedy woman. Left to rule, she would have ruined Tommen as she had Joffrey.\nOutside the wind was rising, clawing at the shutters of his chamber. Ser Kevan pushed himself to his feet. Time to face the lioness in her den. We have pulled her claws. Jaime, though\u00a0\u2026 But no, he would not brood on that.\nHe donned an old, well-worn doublet, in case his niece had a mind to throw another cup of wine in his face, but he left his sword belt hanging on the back of his chair. Only the knights of the Kingsguard were permitted swords in Tommen\u2019s presence.\nSer Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had become too great an effort for him.\nThe meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the ages of twelve and sixteen. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and unworldly than the last, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than seven days in the queen\u2019s service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen\u2019s wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One shared the queen\u2019s bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them.\nA tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face escorted him into the royal presence. Cersei rose when he entered and kissed him lightly on the cheek. \u201cDear uncle. It is so good of you to sup with us.\u201d The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her shaved head. Before her walk she would have flaunted her baldness beneath a golden crown. \u201cCome, sit,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you have wine?\u201d\n\u201cA cup.\u201d He sat, still wary.\nA freckled novice filled their cups with hot spiced wine. \u201cTommen tells me that Lord Tyrell intends to rebuild the Tower of the Hand,\u201d Cersei said.\nSer Kevan nodded. \u201cThe new tower will be twice as tall as the one you burned, he says.\u201d\nCersei gave a throaty laugh. \u201cLong lances, tall towers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0is Lord Tyrell hinting at something?\u201d\nThat made him smile. It is good that she still remembers how to laugh. When he asked if she had all that she required, the queen said, \u201cI am well served. The girls are sweet, and the good septas make certain that I say my prayers. But once my innocence is proved, it would please me if Taena Merryweather might attend me once again. She could bring her son to court. Tommen needs other boys about him, friends of noble birth.\u201d\nIt was a modest request. Ser Kevan saw no reason why it should not be granted. He could foster the Merryweather boy himself, whilst Lady Taena accompanied Cersei back to Casterly Rock. \u201cI will send for her after the trial,\u201d he promised.\nSupper began with beef-and-barley soup, followed by a brace of quail and a roast pike near three feet long, with turnips, mushrooms, and plenty of hot bread and butter. Ser Boros tasted every dish that was set before the king. A humiliating duty for a knight of the Kingsguard, but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and wise, after the way Tommen\u2019s brother had died.\nThe king seemed happier than Kevan Lannister had seen him in a long time. From soup to sweet Tommen burbled about the exploits of his kittens, whilst feeding them morsels of pike off his own royal plate. \u201cThe bad cat was outside my window last night,\u201d he informed Kevan at one point, \u201cbut Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.\u201d\n\u201cThe bad cat?\u201d Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy.\n\u201cAn old black tomcat with a torn ear,\u201d Cersei told him. \u201cA filthy thing, and foul-tempered. He clawed Joff\u2019s hand once.\u201d She made a face. \u201cThe cats keep the rats down, I know, but that one\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he\u2019s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.\u201d\n\u201cI will ask the ratters to set a trap for him.\u201d Ser Kevan could not remember ever seeing his niece so quiet, so subdued, so demure. All for the good, he supposed. But it made him sad as well. Her fire is quenched, she who used to burn so bright. \u201cYou have not asked about your brother,\u201d he said, as they were waiting for the cream cakes. Cream cakes were the king\u2019s favorite.\nCersei lifted her chin, her green eyes shining in the candlelight. \u201cJaime? Have you had word?\u201d\n\u201cNone. Cersei, you may need to prepare yourself for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf he were dead, I would know it. We came into this world together, Uncle. He would not go without me.\u201d She took a drink of wine. \u201cTyrion can leave whenever he wishes. You have had no word of him either, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNo one has tried to sell us a dwarf\u2019s head of late, no.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cUncle, may I ask you a question?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cYour wife\u00a0\u2026\u00a0do you mean to bring her to court?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Dorna was a gentle soul, never comfortable but at home with friends and kin around her. She had done well by their children, dreamed of having grandchildren, prayed seven times a day, loved needlework and flowers. In King\u2019s Landing she would be as happy as one of Tommen\u2019s kittens in a pit of vipers. \u201cMy lady wife mislikes travel. Lannisport is her place.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a wise woman who knows her place.\u201d\nHe did not like the sound of that. \u201cSay what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I did.\u201d Cersei held out her cup. The freckled girl filled it once again. The cream cakes appeared then, and the conversation took a lighter turn. Only after Tommen and his kittens were escorted off to the royal bedchamber by Ser Boros did their talk turn to the queen\u2019s trial.\n\u201cOsney\u2019s brothers will not stand by idly and watch him die,\u201d Cersei warned him.\n\u201cI did not expect that they would. I\u2019ve had the both of them arrested.\u201d\nThat seemed to take her aback. \u201cFor what crime?\u201d\n\u201cFornication with a queen. His High Holiness says that you confessed to bedding both of them\u2014had you forgotten?\u201d\nHer face reddened. \u201cNo. What will you do with them?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall, if they admit their guilt. If they deny it, they can face Ser Robert. Such men should never have been raised so high.\u201d\nCersei lowered her head. \u201cI\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I misjudged them.\u201d\n\u201cYou misjudged a good many men, it seems.\u201d\nHe might have said more, but the dark-haired novice with the round cheeks returned to say, \u201cMy lord, my lady, I am sorry to intrude, but there is a boy below. Grand Maester Pycelle begs the favor of the Lord Regent\u2019s presence at once.\u201d\nDark wings, dark words, Ser Kevan thought. Could Storm\u2019s End have fallen? Or might this be word from Bolton in the north?\n\u201cIt might be news of Jaime,\u201d the queen said.\nThere was only one way to know. Ser Kevan rose. \u201cPray excuse me.\u201d Before he took his leave, he dropped to one knee and kissed his niece upon the hand. If her silent giant failed her, it might be the last kiss she would ever know.\nThe messenger was a boy of eight or nine, so bundled up in fur he seemed a bear cub. Trant had kept him waiting out on the drawbridge rather than admit him into Maegor\u2019s. \u201cGo find a fire, lad,\u201d Ser Kevan told him, pressing a penny into his hand. \u201cI know the way to the rookery well enough.\u201d\nThe snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As Ser Kevan made his way across the inner ward, the castle seemed an alien place, where every keep and tower had grown icy teeth, and all familiar paths had vanished beneath a white blanket. Once an icicle long as a spear fell to shatter by his feet. Autumn in King\u2019s Landing, he brooded. What must it be like up on the Wall?\nThe door was opened by a serving girl, a skinny thing in a fur-lined robe much too big for her. Ser Kevan stamped the snow off his boots, removed his cloak, tossed it to her. \u201cThe Grand Maester is expecting me,\u201d he announced. The girl nodded, solemn and silent, and pointed to the steps.\nPycelle\u2019s chambers were beneath the rookery, a spacious suite of rooms cluttered with racks of herbs and salves and potions and shelves jammed full of books and scrolls. Ser Kevan had always found them uncomfortably hot. Not tonight. Once past the chamber door, the chill was palpable. Black ash and dying embers were all that remained of the hearthfire. A few flickering candles cast pools of dim light here and there.\nThe rest was shrouded in shadow\u00a0\u2026\u00a0except beneath the open window, where a spray of ice crystals glittered in the moonlight, swirling in the wind. On the window seat a raven loitered, pale, huge, its feathers ruffled. It was the largest raven that Kevan Lannister had ever seen. Larger than any hunting hawk at Casterly Rock, larger than the largest owl. Blowing snow danced around it, and the moon painted it silver.\nNot silver. White. The bird is white.\nThe white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.\n\u201cWinter,\u201d said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from the window.\nThen something slammed him in the chest between the ribs, hard as a giant\u2019s fist. It drove the breath from him and sent him lurching backwards. The white raven took to the air, its pale wings slapping him about the head. Ser Kevan half-sat and half-fell onto the window seat. What\u00a0\u2026\u00a0who\u00a0\u2026 A quarrel was sunk almost to the fletching in his chest. No. No, that was how my brother died. Blood was seeping out around the shaft. \u201cPycelle,\u201d he muttered, confused. \u201cHelp me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nThen he saw. Grand Maester Pycelle was seated at his table, his head pillowed on the great leather-bound tome before him. Sleeping, Kevan thought\u00a0\u2026\u00a0until he blinked and saw the deep red gash in the old man\u2019s spotted skull and the blood pooled beneath his head, staining the pages of his book. All around his candle were bits of bone and brain, islands in a lake of melted wax.\nHe wanted guards, Ser Kevan thought. I should have sent him guards. Could Cersei have been right all along? Was this his nephew\u2019s work? \u201cTyrion?\u201d he called. \u201cWhere \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cFar away,\u201d a half-familiar voice replied.\nHe stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered, clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.\n\u201cVarys?\u201d\nThe eunuch set the crossbow down. \u201cSer Kevan. Forgive me if you can. I bear you no ill will. This was not done from malice. It was for the realm. For the children.\u201d\nI have children. I have a wife. Oh, Dorna. Pain washed over him. He closed his eyes, opened them again. \u201cThere are\u00a0\u2026\u00a0there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this castle.\u201d\n\u201cBut none in this room, thankfully. This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but you were threatening to undo all the queen\u2019s good work, to reconcile Highgarden and Casterly Rock, bind the Faith to your little king, unite the Seven Kingdoms under Tommen\u2019s rule. So\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nA gust of wind blew up. Ser Kevan shivered violently.\n\u201cAre you cold, my lord?\u201d asked Varys. \u201cDo forgive me. The Grand Maester befouled himself in dying, and the stink was so abominable that I thought I might choke.\u201d\nSer Kevan tried to rise, but the strength had left him. He could not feel his legs.\n\u201cI thought the crossbow fitting. You shared so much with Lord Tywin, why not that? Your niece will think the Tyrells had you murdered, mayhaps with the connivance of the Imp. The Tyrells will suspect her. Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the Dornishmen. Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king, whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm\u2019s End and the lords of the realm gather round him.\u201d\n\u201cAegon?\u201d For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains. \u201cDead. He\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The eunuch\u2019s voice seemed deeper. \u201cHe is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.\u201d\nKevan Lannister tried to cry out\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to his guards, his wife, his brother\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but the words would not come. Blood dribbled from his mouth. He shuddered violently.\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d Varys wrung his hands. \u201cYou are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going on like some silly old woman. Time to make an end to it.\u201d The eunuch pursed his lips and gave a little whistle.\nSer Kevan was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through him. He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester\u2019s chair. The girl who had opened the door for him was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced children with dark eyes, boys and girls together.\nAnd in their hands, the daggers.",

When the last king of House Gardener was slain on the Field of Fire, his steward, Harlen Tyrell, surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the Conqueror. Aegon granted him the castle and dominion over the Reach. Mace Tyrell declared his support for Renly Baratheon at the onset of the War of the Five Kings, and gave him the hand of his daughter Margaery. Upon Renly\u2019s death, Highgarden made alliance with House Lannister, and Margaery was betrothed to King Joffrey.",

Once again, my thanks to my long-suffering editors and publishers: to Jane Johnson and Joy Chamberlain at Voyager, and Scott Shannon, Nita Taublib, and Anne Groell from Bantam. Their understanding, good humor, and sage advice helped through the tough bits, and I will never cease to be grateful for their patience.\nThanks as well to my equally patient and endlessly supportive agents, Chris Lotts, Vince Gerardis, the fabulous Kay McCauley, and the late Ralph Vicinanza. Ralph, I wish you were here to share this day.\nAnd thanks to Stephen Boucher, the wandering Aussie who helps keep my computer greased and humming whenever he drops by Santa Fe for a breakfast burrito (Xmas) and a side of jalape\u00f1o bacon.\nBack here on the home front, thanks are also due to my dear friends Melinda Snodgrass and Daniel Abraham for their encouragement and support, to my webmaster Pati Nagle for maintaining my corner of the Internet, and to the amazing Raya Golden for the meals, the art, the unfailing good cheer that helped to brighten even the darkest days around Terrapin Station. Even if she did try to steal my cat.\nAs long as it has taken me to dance this dance, it would surely have taken twice as long without the assistance of my faithful (and acerbic) minion and sometime traveling companion Ty Franck, who tends to my computer when Stephen\u2019s not around, keeps the ravening virtual mobs from my virtual doorstep, runs my errands, does my filing, makes the coffee, walks the walk, and charges ten thousand dollars to change a light bulb\u2014all while writing his own kick-ass books on Wednesdays.\nLast, but far from my least, all my love and gratitude to my wife, Parris, who has danced every step of this beside me. Love ya, Phipps.\nGeorge R. R. Martin\r\n May 13, 2011",

He has written fantasy, horror, and science fiction, and for his sins spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer/producer, working on The Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid \u201990s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he\u2019s allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with his wife Parris and their four cats.\nwww.georgerrmartin.com",
