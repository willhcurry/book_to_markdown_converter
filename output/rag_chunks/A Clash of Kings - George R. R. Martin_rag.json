      "content": "Prologue\nThe comet\u2019s tail spread across the dawn, a red slash that bled above the crags of Dragonstone like a wound in the pink and purple sky.\nThe maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers. It was here the ravens came, after long flight. Their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on either side of him, a hellhound and a wyvern, two of the thousand that brooded over the walls of the ancient fortress. When first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had made him uneasy, but as the years passed he had grown used to them. Now he thought of them as old friends. The three of them watched the sky together with foreboding.\nThe maester did not believe in omens. And yet\u2026 old as he was, Cressen had never seen a comet half so bright, nor yet that color, that terrible color, the color of blood and flame and sunsets. He wondered if his gargoyles had ever seen its like. They had been here so much longer than he had, and would still be here long after he was gone. If stone tongues could speak\u2026\nSuch folly. He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath him, the black stone rough beneath his fingers. Talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky. I am an old done man, grown giddy as a child again. Had a lifetime\u2019s hard-won wisdom fled him along with his health and strength? He was a maester, trained and chained in the great Citadel of Oldtown. What had he come to, when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand?\nAnd yet\u2026 and yet\u2026 the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose from the hot vents of Dragonmont behind the castle, and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the Citadel itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word of summer\u2019s end. Omens, all. Too many to deny. What does it all mean? he wanted to cry.\n\u201cMaester Cressen, we have visitors.\u201d Pylos spoke softly, as if loath to disturb Cressen\u2019s solemn meditations. Had he known what drivel filled his head, he would have shouted. \u201cThe princess would see the white raven.\u201d Ever correct, Pylos called her princess now, as her lord father was a king. King of a smoking rock in the great salt sea, yet a king nonetheless. \u201cHer fool is with her.\u201d\nThe old man turned away from the dawn, keeping a hand on his wyvern to steady himself. \u201cHelp me to my chair and show them in.\u201d\nTaking his arm, Pylos led him inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but he was not far from his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years past, he had fallen and shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly. Last year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle\u2026 to help him in his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had come to replace him when he died. He did not mind. Someone must take his place, and sooner than he would like\u2026\nHe let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers. \u201cGo bring her. It is ill to keep a lady waiting.\u201d He waved a hand, a feeble gesture of haste from a man no longer capable of hastening. His flesh was wrinkled and spotted, the skin so papery thin that he could see the web of veins and the shape of bones beneath. And how they trembled, these hands of his that had once been so sure and deft\u2026\nWhen Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool. On his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket, with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells. With his every lurching step, the bells rang, each with a different voice, clang-a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong.\n\u201cWho comes to see us so early, Pylos?\u201d Cressen said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s me and Patches, Maester.\u201d Guileless blue eyes blinked at him. Hers was not a pretty face, alas. The child had her lord father\u2019s square jut of jaw and her mother\u2019s unfortunate ears, along with a disfigurement all her own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed her in the crib. Across half one cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was stiff and dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch. \u201cPylos said we might see the white raven.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed you may,\u201d Cressen answered. As if he would ever deny her. She had been denied too often in her time. Her name was Shireen. She would be ten on her next name day, and she was the saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known. Her sadness is my shame, the old man thought, another mark of my failure. \u201cMaester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the Lady Shireen.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d Pylos was a polite youth, no more than five-and-twenty, yet solemn as a man of sixty. If only he had more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here. Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back. A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served well. Yet he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here. Of late, when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he was.\nThe fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery. His bells rang with the motion. \u201cUnder the sea, the birds have scales for feathers,\u201d he said, clang-a-langing. \u201cI know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nEven for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory. He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not. The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died.\nAn ugly little girl and a sad fool, and maester makes three\u2026 now there is a tale to make men weep. \u201cSit with me, child.\u201d Cressen beckoned her closer. \u201cThis is early to come calling, scarce past dawn. You should be snug in your bed.\u201d\n\u201cI had bad dreams,\u201d Shireen told him. \u201cAbout the dragons. They were coming to eat me.\u201d\nThe child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. \u201cWe have talked of this before,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThe dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child. In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of Valyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations.\u201d He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze. \u201cSo you see, there is nothing to fear. \u201c\nShireen was unconvinced. \u201cWhat about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were talking by the well, and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonsbreath. If the dragons are breathing, doesn\u2019t that mean they are coming to life?\u201d\nThe red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly. Ill enough that she\u2019s filled the head of the mother with her madness, must she poison the daughter\u2019s dreams as well? He would have a stern word with Dalla, warn her not to spread such tales. \u201cThe thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child. A star with a tail, lost in the heavens. It will be gone soon enough, never to be seen again in our lifetimes. Watch and see.\u201d\nShireen gave a brave little nod. \u201cMother said the white raven means it\u2019s not summer anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel.\u201d Cressen\u2019s fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester\u2019s collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. \u201cThey are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory.\u201d\n\u201cWill it get cold now?\u201d Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold.\n\u201cIn time,\u201d Cressen replied. \u201cIf the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come.\u201d The smallfolk said that a long summer meant an even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales.\nPatchface rang his bells. \u201cIt is always summer under the sea,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThe merwives wear nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nShireen giggled. \u201cI should like a gown of silver seaweed.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the sea, it snows up,\u201d said the fool, \u201cand the rain is dry as bone. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\n\u201cWill it truly snow?\u201d the child asked.\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Cressen said. But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for long. \u201cAh, here is Pylos with the bird.\u201d\nShireen gave a cry of delight. Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel. \u201cHere,\u201d he called. The raven spread its wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see to your breakfast now,\u201d Pylos announced. Cressen nodded. \u201cThis is the Lady Shireen,\u201d he told the raven. The bird bobbed its pale head up and down, as if it were bowing. \u201cLady,\u201d it croaked. \u201cLady.\u201d\nThe child\u2019s mouth gaped open. \u201cIt talks!\u201d\n\u201cA few words. As I said, they are clever, these birds.\u201d\n\u201cClever bird, clever man, clever clever fool,\u201d said Patchface, jangling. \u201cOh, clever clever clever fool.\u201d He began to sing. \u201cThe shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,\u201d he sang, hopping from one foot to the other and back again. \u201cThe shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.\u201d He jerked his head with each word, the bells in his antlers sending up a clangor.\nThe white raven screamed and went flapping away to perch on the iron railing of the rookery stairs. Shireen seemed to grow smaller. \u201cHe sings that all the time. I told him to stop but he won\u2019t. It makes me scared. Make him stop.\u201d\nAnd how do I do that? the old man wondered. Once I might have silenced him forever, but now\u2026\nPatchface had come to them as a boy. Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found him in Volantis, across the narrow sea. The king\u2014the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those days\u2014had sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. \u201cWe have found the most splendid fool,\u201d he wrote Cressen, a fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission. \u201cOnly a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to laugh.\u201d\nIt saddened Cressen to remember that letter. No one had ever taught Stannis how to laugh, least of all the boy Patchface. The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its name. The lord\u2019s two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father\u2019s ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm\u2019s End.\nThe boy washed up on the third day. Maester Cressen had come down with the rest, to help put names to the dead. When they found the fool he was naked, his skin white and wrinkled and powdered with wet sand. Cressen had thought him another corpse, but when Jommy grabbed his ankles to drag him off to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat up. To his dying day, Jommy had sworn that Patchface\u2019s flesh was clammy cold.\nNo one ever explained those two days the fool had been lost in the sea. The fisherfolk liked to say a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed. Patchface himself had said nothing. The witty, clever lad that Lord Steffon had written of never reached Storm\u2019s End; the boy they found was someone else, broken in body and mind, hardly capable of speech, much less of wit. Yet his fool\u2019s face left no doubt of who he was. It was the fashion in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants; from neck to scalp the boy\u2019s skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley.\n\u201cThe wretch is mad, and in pain, and no use to anyone, least of all himself,\u201d declared old Ser Harbert, the castellan of Storm\u2019s End in those years. \u201cThe kindest thing you could do for that one is fill his cup with the milk of the poppy. A painless sleep, and there\u2019s an end to it. He\u2019d bless you if he had the wit for it.\u201d But Cressen had refused, and in the end he had won. Whether Patchface had gotten any joy of that victory he could not say, not even today, so many years later.\n\u201cThe shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,\u201d the fool sang on, swinging his head and making his bells clang and clatter. Bong dong, ring-a-ling, bong dong.\n\u201cLord,\u201d the white raven shrieked. \u201cLord, lord, lord.\u201d\n\u201cA fool sings what he will,\u201d the maester told his anxious princess. \u201cYou must not take his words to heart. On the morrow he may remember another song, and this one will never be heard again.\u201d He can sing prettily in four tongues, Lord Steffon had written\u2026\nPylos strode through the door. \u201cMaester, pardons.\u201d\n\u201cYou have forgotten the porridge,\u201d Cressen said, amused. That was most unlike Pylos.\n\u201cMaester, Ser Davos returned last night. They were talking of it in the kitchen. I thought you would want to know at once.\u201d\n\u201cDavos\u2026 last night, you say? Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cWith the king. They have been together most of the night.\u201d\nThere was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken him, no matter the hour, to have him there to give his counsel. \u201cI should have been told,\u201d Cressen complained. \u201cI should have been woken.\u201d He disentangled his fingers from Shireen\u2019s. \u201cPardons, my lady, but I must speak with your lord father. Pylos, give me your arm. There are too many steps in this castle, and it seems to me they add a few every night, just to vex me.\u201d\nShireen and Patchface followed them out, but the child soon grew restless with the old man\u2019s creeping pace and dashed ahead, the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging madly.\nCastles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table, atop the Stone Drum, Dragonstone\u2019s central keep, so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms. To reach him they must cross the gallery, pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate. Young men climbed steps two at a time; for old men with bad hips, every one was a torment. But Lord Stannis would not think to come to him, so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal. He had Pylos to help him, at the least, and for that he was grateful.\nShuffling along the gallery, they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of the outer bailey, the curtain wall, and the fishing village beyond. In the yard, archers were firing at practice butts to the call of \u201cNotch, draw, loose.\u201d Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing. Guardsmen strode the wallwalks, peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without. The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords. Past the sprawl of the camp, the anchorage was crowded with ships. No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again. Lord Stannis\u2019s Fury, a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars, looked almost small beside some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her.\nThe guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight, and passed them through. \u201cWait here,\u201d Cressen told Pylos, within. \u201cIt\u2019s best I see him alone.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a long climb, Maester.\u201d\nCressen smiled. \u201cYou think I have forgotten? I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by name.\u201d\nHalfway up, he regretted his decision. He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth, descending.\nDavos was a slight man, his low birth written plain upon a common face. A well-worn green cloak, stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun, draped his thin shoulders, over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair. About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong. His small beard was well peppered with grey, and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand. When he saw Cressen, he checked his descent.\n\u201cSer Davos,\u201d the maester said. \u201cWhen did you return?\u201d\n\u201cIn the black of morning. My favorite time.\u201d It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand. Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nThe man shook his head. \u201cIt is as you warned him. They will not rise, Maester. Not for him. They do not love him.\u201d\nNo, Cressen thought. Nor will they ever. He is strong, able, just\u2026 aye, just past the point of wisdom\u2026 yet it is not enough. It has never been enough. \u201cYou spoke to them all?\u201d\n\u201cAll? No. Only those that would see me. They do not love me either, these highborns. To them I\u2019ll always be the Onion Knight.\u201d His left hand closed, stubby fingers locking into a fist; Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint, all but the thumb. \u201cI broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose, and the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove. The others\u2014well, Beric Dondarrion is gone missing, some say dead, and Lord Caron is with Renly. Bryce the Orange, of the Rainbow Guard.\u201d\n\u201cThe Rainbow Guard?\u201d\n\u201cRenly\u2019s made his own Kingsguard,\u201d the onetime smuggler explained, \u201cbut these seven don\u2019t wear white. Each one has his own color. Loras Tyrell\u2019s their Lord Commander.\u201d\nIt was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon; a splendid new order of knighthood, with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it. Even as a boy, Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics, and he had loved his games as well. \u201cLook at me!\u201d he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm\u2019s End. \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m a dragon,\u201d or \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m a wizard,\u201d or \u201cLook at me, look at me, I\u2019m the rain god.\u201d\nThe bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-and-twenty, and still he played his games. Look at me, I\u2019m a king, Cressen thought sadly. Oh, Renly, Renly, dear sweet child, do you know what you are doing? And would you care if you did? Is there anyone who cares for him but me? \u201cWhat reasons did the lords give for their refusals?\u201d he asked Ser Davos.\n\u201cWell, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some promises, some only lied.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIn the end words are just wind.\u201d\n\u201cYou could bring him no hope?\u201d\n\u201cOnly the false sort, and I\u2019d not do that,\u201d Davos said. \u201cHe had the truth from me.\u201d\nMaester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted, after the siege of Storm\u2019s End. Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne. Even the sea was closed against them, watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor. Within Storm\u2019s End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats. Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars. Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike. His little ship had a black hull, black sails, black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish. Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm\u2019s End and break the siege.\nLord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knight\u2019s honors\u2026 but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, to pay for all his years of smuggling. Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands. The lord had used a butcher\u2019s cleaver, the better to cut clean and true. Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field\u2014with an onion on its sails. The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim.\nNo, Cressen thought, a man like that would give no false hope, nor soften a hard truth. \u201cSer Davos, truth can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis. He thinks only of returning to King\u2019s Landing in the fullness of his power, to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his. Yet now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf he takes this meager host to King\u2019s Landing, it will be only to die. He does not have the numbers. I told him as much, but you know his pride.\u201d Davos held up his gloved hand. \u201cMy fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense.\u201d\nThe old man sighed. \u201cYou have done all you could. Now I must add my voice to yours.\u201d Wearily, he resumed his climb.\nLord Stannis Baratheon\u2019s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass. In the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest. The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less than four feet across at its narrowest. Aegon\u2019s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon\u2019s day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests.\nThere was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop. Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool. When Maester Cressen entered, he glanced up. \u201cI knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no.\u201d There was no hint of warmth in his voice; there seldom was.\nStannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel. Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, the late King Robert, had grown a beard in his final years. Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild thing, thick and flerce. As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short. They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away.\n\u201cOnce you would have woken me,\u201d the old man said.\n\u201cOnce you were young. Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep.\u201d Stannis had never learned to soften his speech, to dissemble or flatter; he said what he thought, and those that did not like it could be damned. \u201cI knew you\u2019d learn what Davos had to say soon enough. You always do, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI would be of no help to you if I did not,\u201d Cressen said. \u201cI met Davos on the stair.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he told all, I suppose? I should have had the man\u2019s tongue shortened along with his fingers.\u201d\n\u201cHe would have made you a poor envoy then.\u201d\n\u201cHe made me a poor envoy in any case. The storm lords will not rise for me. It seems they do not like me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to them. The cravenly ones will sit behind their walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph. The bold ones have already declared for Renly. For Renly!\u201d He spat out the name like poison on his tongue.\n\u201cYour brother has been the Lord of Storm\u2019s End these past thirteen years. These lords are his sworn bannermen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHis,\u201d Stannis broke in, \u201cwhen by rights they should be mine. I never asked for Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert\u2019s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me. And what was Robert\u2019s thanks? He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm\u2019s End and its incomes to Renly. Storm\u2019s End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne.\u201d\nIt was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now. Here was the heart of his lord\u2019s weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed. Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister.\n\u201cRobert did you an injustice,\u201d Maester Cressen replied carefully, \u201cyet he had sound reasons. Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen. He needed a man\u2019s strength to rule here, and Renly was but a child.\u201d\n\u201cHe is a child still,\u201d Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, \u201ca thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow. What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man. That is the sum of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king. I ask you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot answer for the gods.\u201d\n\u201cYou seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me. Who maesters for Renly? Perchance I should send for him, I might like his counsel better. What do you think this maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown? What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?\u201d\n\u201cIt would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace.\u201d The youngest of Lord Steffon\u2019s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather than calculation. In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Stannis repeated bitterly. \u201cYou mock me with a king\u2019s style, yet what am I king of? Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom.\u201d He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King\u2019s Landing now stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. \u201cTonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor crop, if truth be told, but they are what my brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven. Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining us. Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once. What am I to tell them? What must I do now?\u201d\n\u201cYour true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,\u201d Maester Cressen answered. \u201cIf you and your brother were to make common cause against them\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will not treat with Renly,\u201d Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument. \u201cNot while he calls himself a king.\u201d\n\u201cNot Renly, then,\u201d the maester yielded. His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, there was no changing it. \u201cOthers might serve your needs as well. Eddard Stark\u2019s son has been proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him.\u201d\n\u201cA green boy,\u201d said Stannis, \u201cand another false king. Am I to accept a broken realm?\u201d\n\u201cSurely half a kingdom is better than none,\u201d Cressen said, \u201cand if you help the boy avenge his father\u2019s murder\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure. Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he treated me. I held Storm\u2019s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert\u2019s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them. \u201c\n\u201cBe that as it may, my lord,\u201d Maester Cressen said gently. \u201cGreat wrongs have been done you, but the past is dust. The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks. There are others you might sound out as well. What of Lady Arryn? If the queen murdered her husband, surely she will want justice for him. She has a young son, Jon Arryn\u2019s heir. If you were to betroth Shireen to him\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe boy is weak and sickly,\u201d Lord Stannis objected. \u201cEven his father saw how it was, when he asked me to foster him on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie. She\u2019ll never part with the boy, I promise you that. \u201c\n\u201cThen you must send Shireen to the Eyrie,\u201d the maester urged. \u201cDragonstone is a grim home for a child. Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her.\u201d\n\u201cFamiliar and hideous.\u201d Stannis furrowed his brow in thought. \u201cStill\u2026 perhaps it is worth the trying\u2026\n\u201cMust the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice asked sharply.\nMaester Cressen turned sand bowed his head. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said, chagrined that he had not heard her enter.\nLord Stannis scowled. \u201cI do not beg. Of anyone. Mind you remember that, woman.\u201d\n\u201cI am pleased to hear it, my lord.\u201d Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband, thin of body and thin of face, with prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip. She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes were pale, her mouth stern, her voice a whip. She cracked it now. \u201cLady Arryn owes you her allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, and all the rest. You are their one true king. It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god.\u201d\nGod, she said, not gods. The red woman had won her, heart and soul, turning her from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms, both old and new, to worship the one they called the Lord of Light.\n\u201cYour god can keep his grace,\u201d said Lord Stannis, who did not share his wife\u2019s fervent new faith. \u201cIt\u2019s swords I need, not blessings. Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you\u2019ve not told me of?\u201d There was no affection in his tone. Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women, even his own wife. When he had gone to King\u2019s Landing to sit on Robert\u2019s council, he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had been few, his visits fewer; he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took no joy in it, and the sons he had once hoped for had never come.\n\u201cMy brothers and uncles and cousins have armies,\u201d she told him. \u201cHouse Florent will rally to your banner.\u201d\n\u201cHouse Florent can field two thousand swords at best.\u201d It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms. \u201cAnd you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I do, my lady. The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell\u2019s wrath.\u201d\n\u201cThere is another way.\u201d Lady Selyse moved closer. \u201cLook out your windows, my lord. There is the sign you have waited for, blazoned on the sky. Red, it is, the red of flame, red for the fiery heart of the true god. it is his banner\u2014and yours! See how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragon\u2019s hot breath, and you the Lord of Dragonstone. It means your time has come, Your Grace. Nothing is more certain. You are meant to sail from this desolate rock as Aegon the Conqueror once sailed, to sweep all before you as he did. Only say the word, and embrace the power of the Lord of Light.\u201d\n\u201cHow many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand?\u201d Stannis demanded again.\n\u201cAll you need,\u201d his wife promised, \u201cThe swords of Storm\u2019s End and Highgarden for a start, and all their lords bannermen.\u201d\n\u201cDavos would tell you different,\u201d Stannis said. \u201cThose swords are sworn to Renly. They love my charming young brother, as they once loved Robert\u2026 and as they have never loved me.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut if Renly should die\u2026\u201d\nStannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes, until Cressen could not hold his tongue. \u201cIt is not to be thought. Your Grace, whatever follies Renly has committed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFollies? I call them treasons.\u201d Stannis turned back to his wife. \u201cMy brother is young and strong, and he has a vast host around him, and these rainbow knights of his.\u201d\n\u201cMelisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen him dead.\u201d\nCressen was horrorstruck. \u201cFratricide\u2026 my lord, this is evil, unthinkable\u2026 please, listen to me.\u201d\nLady Selyse gave him a measured look. \u201cAnd what will you tell him, Maester? How he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn?\u201d\n\u201cI have heard your counsel, Cressen,\u201d Lord Stannis said. \u201cNow I will hear hers. You are dismissed.\u201d\nMaester Cressen bent a stiff knee. He could feel Lady Selyse\u2019s eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly across the room. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he said to Pylos.\nWhen he was safe back in his own rooms, Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his balcony once more, to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea. One of Salladhor Saan\u2019s warships was sweeping past the castle, her gaily striped hull slicing through the grey-green waters as her oars rose and fell. He watched until she vanished behind a headland. Would that my fears could vanish so easily. Had he lived so long for this?\nWhen a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly\u2026 three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon. Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other? He could not allow it, would not allow it.\nThe woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the other one. The red woman, the servants had named her, afraid to speak her name. \u201cI will speak her name,\u201d Cressen told his stone hellhound. \u201cMelisandre. Her.\u201d Melisandre of Asshai, sorceress, shadowbinder, and priestess to R\u2019hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Melisandre, whose madness must not be allowed to spread beyond Dragonstone.\nHis chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning. With fumbling hands, the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair, where his ointments, potions, and medicines stood neatly on their shelves. On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial\u2019s contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he\u2019d been reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before.\nThe chain around his throat felt very heavy. He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger. Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death. It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be discarded, but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow and difficult, the necessaries costly and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, though, and the Faceless Men of Braavos\u2026 and the maesters of his order as well, though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the Citadel. All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of healing\u2014but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill.\nCressen no longer recalled the name the Asshai\u2019i gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners the crystal. In the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man\u2019s throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said a victim\u2019s face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food.\nAnd this very night Lord Stannis would feast his bannermen, his lady wife\u2026 and the red woman, Melisandre of Asshai.\nI must rest, Maester Cressen told himself. I must have all my strength come dark. My hands must not shake, nor my courage flag. It is a dreadful thing I do, yet it must be done. If there are gods, surely they will forgive me. He had slept so poorly of late. A nap would refresh him for the ordeal ahead. Wearily, he tottered off to his bed. Yet when he closed his eyes, he could still see the light of the comet, red and flery and vividly alive amidst the darkness of his dreams. Perhaps it is my comet, he thought drowsily at the last, just before sleep took him. An omen of blood, foretelling murder\u2026 yes\u2026\nWhen he woke it was full dark, his bedchamber was black, and every joint in his body ached. Cressen pushed himself up, his head throbbing. Clutching for his cane, he rose unsteady to his feet. So late, he thought. They did not summon me. He was always summoned for feasts, seated near the salt, close to Lord Stannis. His lord\u2019s face swam up before him, not the man he was but the boy he had been, standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on his elder brother. Whatever he did, Robert had done first, and better. Poor boy\u2026 he must hurry, for his sake.\nThe maester found the crystals where he had left them, and scooped them off the parchment. Cressen owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe. He secreted the strangler seeds in one of them, threw open his door, and called, \u201cPylos? Where are you?\u201d When he heard no reply, he called again, louder. \u201cPylos, I need help.\u201d Still there came no answer. That was queer; the young maester had his cell only a half turn down the stair, within easy earshot.\nIn the end, Cressen had to shout for the servants. \u201cMake haste,\u201d he told them. \u201cI have slept too long. They will be feasting by now\u2026 drinking\u2026 I should have been woken.\u201d What had happened to Maester Pylos? Truly, he did not understand.\nAgain he had to cross the long gallery. A night wind whispered through the great windows, sharp with the smell of the sea. Torches flickered along the walls of Dragonstone, and in the camp beyond, he could see hundreds of cookfires burning, as if a field of stars had fallen to the earth. Above, the comet blazed red and malevolent. I am too old and wise to fear such things, the maester told himself.\nThe doors to the Great Hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon. He told the servants to leave him outside. It would be better to enter alone; he must not appear feeble. Leaning heavily on his cane, Cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway teeth. A pair of guardsmen opened the heavy red doors before him, unleashing a sudden blast of noise and light. Cressen stepped down into the dragon\u2019s maw.\nOver the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk, he heard Patchface singing, \u201c\u2026dance, my lord, dance my lord,\u201d to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells. The same dreadful song he\u2019d sung this morning. \u201cThe shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.\u201d The lower tables were crowded with knights, archers, and sellsword captains, tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak in their fish stew. Here there was no loud laughter, no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of other men\u2019s feasts; Lord Stannis did not permit such.\nCressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king. He had to step wide around Patchface. Dancing, his bells ringing, the fool neither saw nor heard his approach. As he hopped from one leg to the other, Patchface lurched into Cressen, knocking his cane out from under him. They went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs, while a sudden gale of laughter went up around them. No doubt it was a comical sight.\nPatchface sprawled half on top of him, motley fool\u2019s face pressed close to his own. He had lost his tin helm with its antlers and bells. \u201cUnder the sea, you fall up,\u201d he declared. \u201cI know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d Giggling, the fool rolled off, bounded to his feet, and did a little dance.\nTrying to make the best of it, the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise, but his hip was in such pain that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again. He felt strong hands grasp him under the arms and lift him back to his feet. \u201cThank you, ser,\u201d he murmured, turning to see which knight had come to his aid\u2026\n\u201cMaester,\u201d said Lady Melisandre, her deep voice flavored with the music of the Jade Sea. \u201cYou ought take more care.\u201d As ever, she wore red head to heel, a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire, with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric beneath. Around her throat was a red gold choker tighter than any maester\u2019s chain, ornamented with a single great ruby.\nHer hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men, but a deep burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches. Even her eyes were red\u2026 but her skin was smooth and white, unblemished, pale as cream. Slender she was, graceful, taller than most knights, with full breasts and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face. Men\u2019s eyes that once found her did not quickly look away, not even a maester\u2019s eyes. Many called her beautiful. She was not beautiful. She was red, and terrible, and red.\n\u201cI\u2026 thank you, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cA man your age must look to where he steps,\u201d Melisandre said courteously. \u201cThe night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d\nHe knew the phrase, some prayer of her faith. It makes no matter, I have a faith of my own. \u201cOnly children fear the dark,\u201d he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up his song again. \u201cThe shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord.\u201d\n\u201cNow here is a riddle,\u201d Melisandre said. \u201cA clever fool and a foolish wise man.\u201d Bending, she picked up Patchface\u2019s helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen\u2019s head. The cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket slid down over his ears. \u201cA crown to match your chain, Lord Maester,\u201d she announced. All around them, men were laughing.\nCressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage. She thought he was feeble and helpless, but she would learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet he was still a maester of the Citadel. \u201cI need no crown but truth,\u201d he told her, removing the fool\u2019s helm from his head.\n\u201cThere are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown.\u201d Melisandre turned from him in a swirl of red silk and made her way back to the high table, where King Stannis and his queen were seated. Cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to Patchface, and made to follow.\nMaester Pylos sat in his place.\nThe old man could only stop and stare. \u201cMaester Pylos,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou\u2026 you did not wake me.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace commanded me to let you rest.\u201d Pylos had at least the grace to blush. \u201cHe told me you were not needed here.\u201d\nCressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged and sour, wore a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur, pious Lord Sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger, and the Lysene captain Salladhor Saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in brown doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes.\n\u201cYou are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man.\u201d It sounded so like Lord Stannis\u2019s voice, but it could not be, it could not. \u201cPylos will counsel me henceforth. Already he works with the ravens, since you can no longer climb to the rookery. I will not have you kill yourself in my service.\u201d\nMaester Cressen blinked. Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don\u2019t you know how I have cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better than Robert even, or Renly, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most. Yet all he said was, \u201cAs you command, my lord, but\u2026 but I am hungry. Might not I have a place at your table?\u201d At your side, I belong at your side\u2026\nSer Davos rose from the bench. \u201cI should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated herself at his right hand, in the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on his left, flashing a smile as bright and brittle as her jewels.\nToo far, Cressen thought dully, looking at where Ser Davos was seated. Half of the lords bannermen were between the smuggler and the high table. I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her cup, yet how?\nPatchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth. \u201cHere we eat fish,\u201d the fool declared happily, waving a cod about like a scepter. \u201cUnder the sea, the fish eat us. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nSer Davos moved aside to make room on the bench. \u201cWe all should be in motley tonight,\u201d he said gloomily as Cressen seated himself, \u201cfor this is fool\u2019s business we\u2019re about. The red woman has seen victory in her flames, so Stannis means to press his claim, no matter what the numbers. Before she\u2019s done we\u2019re all like to see what Patchface saw, I fear\u2014the bottom of the sea.\u201d\nCressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth. His fingers found the hard lumps the crystals made in the wool. \u201cLord Stannis.\u201d\nStannis turned from the red woman, but it was Lady Selyse who replied. \u201cKing Stannis. You forget yourself, Maester.\u201d\n\u201cHe is old, his mind wanders,\u201d the king told her gruffly. \u201cWhat is it, Cressen? Speak your mind.\u201d\n\u201cAs you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI make common cause with no one,\u201d Stannis Baratheon said.\n\u201cNo more than light makes common cause with darkness.\u201d Lady Selyse took his hand.\nStannis nodded. \u201cThe Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have stolen my throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights. They are all usurpers, and they are all my enemies.\u201d\nI have lost him, Cressen thought, despairing. If only he could somehow approach Melisandre unseen\u2026 he needed but an instant\u2019s access to her cup. \u201cYou are the rightful heir to your brother Robert, the true Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men,\u201d he said desperately, \u201cbut even so, you cannot hope to triumph without allies.\u201d\n\u201cHe has an ally,\u201d Lady Selyse said. \u201cR\u2019hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow.\u201d\n\u201cGods make uncertain allies at best,\u201d the old man insisted, \u201cand that one has no power here.\u201d\n\u201cYou think not?\u201d The ruby at Melisandre\u2019s throat caught the light as she turned her head, and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet. \u201cIf you will speak such folly, Maester, you ought to wear your crown again.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Selyse agreed. \u201cPatches\u2019s helm. It suits you well, old man. Put it on again, I command you.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the sea, no one wears hats,\u201d Patchface said. \u201cI know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nLord Stannis\u2019s eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow, his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently. He always ground his teeth when he was angry. \u201cFool,\u201d he growled at last, \u201cmy lady wife commands. Give Cressen your helm.\u201d\nNo, the old maester thought, this is not you, not your way, you were always just, always hard yet never cruel, never, you did not understand mockery, no more than you understood laughter.\nPatchface danced closer, his cowbells ringing, clang-a-lang, ding-ding, clink-clank-clink-clank. The maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow. Cressen bowed his head beneath the weight. His bells clanged. \u201cPerhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth,\u201d Lady Selyse said.\n\u201cYou go too far, woman,\u201d Lord Stannis said. \u201cHe is an old man, and he\u2019s served me well.\u201d\nAnd I will serve you to the last, my sweet lord, my poor lonely son, Cressen thought, for suddenly he saw the way. Ser Davos\u2019s cup was before him, still half-full of sour red. He found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve, held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup. Smooth motions, deft, I must not fumble now, he prayed, and the gods were kind. In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady for years, nor half so fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose to his feet. \u201cMayhaps I have been a fool. Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with me? A cup in honor of your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his power? \u201c\nThe red woman studied him. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d\nHe could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, catching his sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cA thing that must be done,\u201d Maester Cressen answered, \u201cfor the sake of the realm, and the soul of my lord.\u201d He shook off Davos\u2019s hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes.\nShe met him beneath the high table with every man\u2019s eyes upon them. But Cressen saw only her. Red silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own, around the cup. Her skin felt hot, feverish. \u201cIt is not too late to spill the wine, Maester.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered hoarsely. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and deep. There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him. \u201cAnd now you.\u201d\nHis hands were shaking, but he made himself be strong. A maester of the Citadel must not be afraid. The wine was sour on his tongue. He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor. \u201cHe does have power here, my lord,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd fire cleanses.\u201d At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly.\nCressen tried to reply, but his words caught in his throat. His cough became a terrible thin whistle as he strained to suck in air. Iron fingers tightened round his neck. As he sank to his knees, still he shook his head, denying her, denying her power, denying her magic, denying her god. And the cowbells peeled in his antlers, singing fool, fool, fool while the red woman looked down on him in pity, the candle flames dancing in her red red eyes.",

      "content": "Arya\nAt Winterfell they had called her \u201cArya Horseface\u201d and she\u2019d thought nothing could be worse, but that was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her \u201cLumpyhead.\u201d\nHer head felt lumpy when she touched it. When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she\u2019d thought he meant to kill her, but the sour old man had only held her tight, sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger. She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones, toward the sept where her father had died. \u201cI\u2019m taking men and boys from the city,\u201d Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head. \u201cNow you hold still, boy.\u201d By the time he had finished, her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble.\nAfterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she\u2019d be Arry the orphan boy. \u201cGate shouldn\u2019t be hard, but the road\u2019s another matter. You got a long way to go in bad company. I got thirty this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall, and don\u2019t be thinking they\u2019re like that bastard brother o\u2019 yours.\u201d He shook her. \u201cLord Eddard gave me pick o\u2019 the dungeons, and I didn\u2019t find no little lordlings down there. This lot, half o\u2019 them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half\u2019d do the same, only they\u2019d rape you first. So you keep to yourself and make your water in the woods, alone. That\u2019ll be the hardest part, the pissing, so don\u2019t drink no more\u2019n you need.\u201d\nLeaving King\u2019s Landing was easy, just like he\u2019d said. The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through. No one spared Arya a glance. They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the King\u2019s Hand, not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Arya never looked back. She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and his mother. But she knew it wouldn\u2019t, and anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead.\nYoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn\u2019t the hardest part at all; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet. The rest he\u2019d found in chains. \u201cThe Watch needs good men,\u201d he told them as they set out, \u201cbut you lot will have to do.\u201d\nYoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. The worst were the three he\u2019d found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they\u2019d stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where it had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human.\nThey took five wagons out of King\u2019s Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides and bolts of cloth, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon.\nThe men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared, or stupid, or deaf. \u201cLook at that sword Lumpyhead\u2019s got there,\u201d Lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He\u2019d been a dyer\u2019s apprentice before he was caught stealing, and his arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding. \u201cWhere\u2019s a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?\u201d\nArya chewed her lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren\u2019s faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons, but she was determined not to go crying to him for help.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s a little squire,\u201d Hot Pie put in. His mother had been a baker before she died, and he\u2019d pushed her cart through the streets all day, shouting \u201cHot pies! Hot pies!\u201d \u201cSome lordy lord\u2019s little squire boy, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t no squire, look at him. I bet that\u2019s not even a real sword. I bet it\u2019s just some play sword made of tin.\u201d\nArya hated them making fun of Needle. \u201cIt\u2019s castle-forged steel, you stupid,\u201d she snapped, turning in the saddle to glare at them, \u201cand you better shut your mouth.\u201d\nThe orphan boys hooted. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?\u201d Hot Pie wanted to know.\n\u201cLumpyhead,\u201d corrected Lommy. \u201cHe prob\u2019ly stole it.\u201d\n\u201cI did not!\u201d she shouted. Jon Snow had given her Needle. Maybe she had to let them call her Lumpyhead, but she wasn\u2019t going to let them call Jon a thief.\n\u201cIf he stole it, we could take it off him,\u201d said Hot Pie. \u201cIt\u2019s not his anyhow. I could use me a sword like that.\u201d\nLommy egged him on. \u201cGo on, take it off him, I dare you.\u201d\nHot Pie kicked his donkey, riding closer. \u201cHey, Lumpyface, you gimme that sword.\u201d His hair was the color of straw, his fat face all sunburnt and peeling. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to use it.\u201d\nYes I do, Arya could have said. I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed him in the belly and he died, and I\u2019ll kill you too if you don\u2019t let me alone. Only she did not dare. Yoren didn\u2019t know about the stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out. Arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too, the three in the manacles for sure, but the queen wasn\u2019t looking for them, so it wasn\u2019t the same.\n\u201cLook at him,\u201d brayed Lommy Greenhands. \u201cI bet he\u2019s going to cry now. You want to cry, Lumpyhead?\u201d\nShe had cried in her sleep the night before, dreaming of her father. Come morning, she\u2019d woken red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to wet his pants,\u201d Hot Pie suggested.\n\u201cLeave him be,\u201d said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them. Lommy had named him the Bull, on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore. Lommy didn\u2019t dare mock the Bull. He was older, and big for his age, with a broad chest and strong-looking arms.\n\u201cYou better give Hot Pie the sword, Arry,\u201d Lommy said. \u201cHot Pie wants it bad. He kicked a boy to death. He\u2019ll do the same to you, I bet.\u201d\n\u201cI knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until he was dead,\u201d Hot Pie boasted. \u201cI kicked him all to pieces. His balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black. You better gimme the sword.\u201d\nArya slid her practice sword from her belt. \u201cYou can have this one,\u201d she told Hot Pie, not wanting to fight.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just some stick.\u201d He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle\u2019s hilt.\nArya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey\u2019s hindquarters. The animal hawed and bucked, dumping Hot Pie on the ground. She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt. Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking. Blood dribbled from his nostrils. When Hot Pie began to wail, Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands, who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed. \u201cYou want some sword too?\u201d she yelled, but he didn\u2019t. He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away.\nThe Bull shouted, \u201cBehind you,\u201d and Arya spun. Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist closing around a big jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking her head as it sailed past. Then she flew at him. He raised a hand and she hit it, and then his cheek, and then his knee. He grabbed for her, and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head. He fell down and got up and stumbled after her, his red face all smeared with dirt and blood. Arya slid into a water dancer\u2019s stance and waited. When he came close enough, she lunged, right between his legs, so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks.\nBy the time Yoren pulled her off him, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly, crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over. \u201cEnough,\u201d the black brother roared, prying the stick sword from her fingers, \u201cyou want to kill the fool?\u201d When Lommy and some others started to squeal, the old man turned on them too. \u201cShut your mouths, or I\u2019ll be shutting them for you. Any more o\u2019 this, I\u2019ll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall.\u201d He spat. \u201cAnd that goes twice for you, Arry. You come with me, boy. Now.\u201d\nThey were all looking at her, even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon. The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed, but Arya ignored him.\nThe old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering all the while. \u201cIf I had a thimble o\u2019 sense, I would\u2019ve left you in King\u2019s Landing. You hear me, boy?\u201d He always snarled that word, putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear. \u201cUnlace your breeches and pull \u2018em down. Go on, there\u2019s no one here to see. Do it.\u201d\nSullenly, Arya did as he said. \u201cOver there, against the oak. Yes, like that.\u201d She wrapped her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood. \u201cYou scream now. You scream loud.\u201d\nI won\u2019t, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs, the shriek burst out of her anyway. \u201cThink that hurt?\u201d he said. \u201cTry this one.\u201d The stick came whistling. Arya shrieked again, clutching the tree to keep from falling. \u201cOne more.\u201d She held on tight, chewing her lip, flinching when she heard it coming. The stroke made her jump and howl. I won\u2019t cry, she thought, I won\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a Stark of Winterfell, our sigil is the direwolf, direwolves don\u2019t cry. She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg. Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain. \u201cMight be I got your attention now,\u201d Yoren said. \u201cNext time you take that stick to one of your brothers, you\u2019ll get twice what you give, you hear me? Now cover yourself.\u201d\nThey\u2019re not my brothers, Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches, but she knew better than to say so. Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces.\nYoren was looking at her. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d\nCalm as still water, she told herself, the way Syrio Forel had taught her. \u201cSome.\u201d\nHe spat. \u201cThat pie boy\u2019s hurting worse. It wasn\u2019t him as killed your father, girl, nor that thieving Lommy neither. Hitting them won\u2019t bring him back.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Arya muttered sullenly.\n\u201cHere\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like it did. I was set to leave, wagons bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for me, and a purse of coin, and a message, never mind who it\u2019s from. Lord Eddard\u2019s to take the black, he says to me, wait, he\u2019ll be going with you. Why d\u2019you think I was there? Only something went queer.\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey,\u201d Arya breathed. \u201cSomeone should kill him!\u201d\n\u201cSomeone will, but it won\u2019t be me, nor you neither.\u201d Yoren tossed back her stick sword. \u201cGot sourleaf back at the wagons,\u201d he said as they made their way back to the road. \u201cYou\u2019ll chew some, it\u2019ll help with the sting.\u201d\nIt did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood. Even so, she walked for the rest of that day, and the day after, and the day after that, too raw to sit a donkey. Hot Pie was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley, and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn\u2019t even hurt, yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get. \u201cEvery time you look at him, he twitches,\u201d the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey. She did not answer. It seemed safer not to talk to anyone.\nThat night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. \u201cThe Red Sword,\u201d the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn\u2019t a new sword, it was Ice, her father\u2019s greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard\u2019s blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King\u2019s Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.\nWhen at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall, and Yoren had promised he\u2019d leave her there with no one any wiser about who she\u2019d been. She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon\u2026 but it was Jon Snow she thought of most. She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, so Jon might muss up her hair and call her \u201clittle sister.\u201d She\u2019d tell him, \u201cI missed you,\u201d and he\u2019d say it too at the very same moment, the way they always used to say things together. She would have liked that. She would have liked that better than anything.",

      "content": "Sansa\nThe morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cGlory to your betrothed,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201cSee how it flames across the sky today on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d\nDoubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. \u201cI\u2019ve heard servants calling it the Dragon\u2019s Tail.\u201d\n\u201cKing Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by his son,\u201d Ser Arys said. \u201cHe is the dragon\u2019s heir\u2014and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey\u2019s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies.\u201d\nIs it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey\u2019s enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king\u2019s command. Must Robb and her lady mother die next? The comet was red, but Joffrey was Baratheon as much as Lannister, and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field. Shouldn\u2019t the gods have sent Joff a golden comet?\nSansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window. \u201cYou look very lovely today, my lady,\u201d Ser Arys said.\n\u201cThank you, ser.\u201d Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor, Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms. Those were Joffrey\u2019s gifts as well. When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North, his rage had been a fearsome thing, and he had sent Ser Boros to beat her.\n\u201cShall we go?\u201d Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber. If she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging her steps, Sansa preferred that it be him. Ser Boros was short-tempered, Ser Meryn cold, and Ser Mandon\u2019s strange dead eyes made her uneasy, while Ser Preston treated her like a lackwit child. Arys Oakheart was courteous, and would talk to her cordially. Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded him to hit her. He did hit her in the end, but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have, and at least he had argued. The others obeyed without question\u2026 except for the Hound, but Joff never asked the Hound to punish her. He used the other five for that.\nSer Arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon. Today he made quite the dashing figure, with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf, and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread. \u201cWho do you think will win the day\u2019s honors?\u201d Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ser Arys answered, smiling. \u201cYet I fear the triumph will have no savor. This will be a small field, and poor. No more than two score will enter the lists, including squires and freeriders. There is small honor in unhorsing green boys.\u201d\nThe last tourney had been different, Sansa reflected. King Robert had staged it in her father\u2019s honor. High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete, and the whole city had turned out to watch. She remembered the splendor of it: the field of pavilions along the river with a knight\u2019s shield hung before each door, the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind, the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs. The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves, and the nights had been full of feasts and song. Those had been the most magical days of her life, but they seemed a memory from another age now. Robert Baratheon was dead, and her father as well, beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor. Now there were three kings in the land, and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men. Small wonder that they had to hold Joff\u2019s tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep.\n\u201cWill the queen attend, do you think?\u201d Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to restrain her son.\n\u201cI fear not, my lady. The council is meeting, some urgent business.\u201d Ser Arys dropped his voice. \u201cLord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded. Her Grace is furious.\u201d He fell silent as a column of Lannister guardsmen marched past, in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Ser Arys was fond of gossip, but only when he was certain that no one was listening.\nThe carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey. It was a poor thing indeed, and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats. Most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister; of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few, the handful that remained at court. Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk. Lady Tanda was bracketed by her daughters, placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse. Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse\u2019s lap. The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen\u2019s cousins, so the Lannisters might claim her lands.\nThe king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen sat behind him. In the back of the royal box, Sandor Clegane stood at guard, his hands resting on his swordbelt. The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. \u201cLady Sansa,\u201d the Hound announced curtly when he saw her. His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood. The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke.\nPrincess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa\u2019s name, but plump little Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly. \u201cSansa, did you hear? I\u2019m to ride in the tourney today. Mother said I could.\u201d Tommen was all of eight. He reminded her of her own little brother, Bran. They were of an age. Bran was back at Winterfell, a cripple, yet safe.\nSansa would have given anything to be with him. \u201cI fear for the life of your foeman,\u201d she told Tommen solemnly.\n\u201cHis foeman will be stuffed with straw,\u201d Joff said as he rose. The king was clad in a gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest, as if he expected the war to engulf them at any moment. He was thirteen today, and tall for his age, with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, dipping in a curtsy.\nSer Arys bowed. \u201cPray pardon me, Your Grace. I must equip myself for the lists.\u201d\nJoffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied Sansa from head to heels. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you wore my stones.\u201d\nSo the king had decided to play the gallant today. Sansa was relieved. \u201cI thank you for them\u2026 and for your tender words. I pray you a lucky name day, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cSit,\u201d Joff commanded, gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own. \u201cHave you heard? The Beggar King is dead.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb.\n\u201cViserys. The last son of Mad King Aerys. He\u2019s been going about the Free Cities since before I was born, calling himself a king. Well, Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned him. With molten gold.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, don\u2019t you think? The dragon was their sigil. It\u2019s almost as good as if some wolf killed your traitor brother. Maybe I\u2019ll feed him to wolves after I\u2019ve caught him. Did I tell you, I intend to challenge him to single combat?\u201d\n\u201cI should like to see that, Your Grace.\u201d More than you know. Sansa kept her tone cool and polite, yet even so Joffrey\u2019s eyes narrowed as he tried to decide whether she was mocking him. \u201cWill you enter the lists today?\u201d she asked quickly.\nThe king frowned. \u201cMy lady mother said it was not fitting, since the tourney is in my honor. Otherwise I would have been champion. Isn\u2019t that so, dog?\u201d\nThe Hound\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cAgainst this lot? Why not?\u201d\nHe had been the champion in her father\u2019s tourney, Sansa remembered. \u201cWill you joust today, my lord?\u201d she asked him.\nClegane\u2019s voice was thick with contempt. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be worth the bother of arming myself. This is a tournament of gnats.\u201d\nThe king laughed. \u201cMy dog has a fierce bark. Perhaps I should command him to fight the day\u2019s champion. To the death.\u201d Joffrey was fond of making men fight to the death.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be one knight the poorer.\u201d The Hound had never taken a knight\u2019s vows. His brother was a knight, and he hated his brother.\nA blare of trumpets sounded. The king settled back in his seat and took Sansa\u2019s hand. Once that would have set her heart to pounding, but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting her with her father\u2019s head. His touch filled her with revulsion now, but she knew better than to show it. She made herself sit very still.\n\u201cSer Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard,\u201d a herald called.\nSer Meryn entered from the west side of the yard, clad in gleaming white plate chased with gold and mounted on a milk-white charger with a flowing grey mane. His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow. He carried a twelve-foot lance.\n\u201cSer Hobber of House Redwyne, of the Arbor,\u201d the herald sang. Ser Hobber trotted in from the east, riding a black stallion caparisoned in burgundy and blue. His lance was striped in the same colors, and his shield bore the grape cluster sigil of his House. The Redwyne twins were the queen\u2019s unwilling guests, even as Sansa was. She wondered whose notion it had been for them to ride in Joffrey\u2019s tourney. Not their own, she thought.\nAt a signal from the master of revels, the combatants couched their lances and put their spurs to their mounts. There were shouts from the watching guardsmen and the lords and ladies in the gallery. The knights came together in the center of the yard with a great shock of wood and steel. The white lance and the striped one exploded in splinters within a second of each other. Hobber Redwyne reeled at the impact, yet somehow managed to keep his seat. Wheeling their horses about at the far end of the lists, the knights tossed down their broken lances and accepted replacements from the squires. Ser Horas Redwyne, Ser Hobber\u2019s twin, shouted encouragement to his brother.\nBut on their second pass Ser Meryn swung the point of his lance to strike Ser Hobber in the chest, driving him from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth. Ser Horas cursed and ran out to help his battered brother from the field.\n\u201cPoorly ridden,\u201d declared King Joffrey.\n\u201cSer Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch,\u201d came the herald\u2019s cry. Wide white wings ornamented Ser Balon\u2019s greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. \u201cMorros of House Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cLook at that upjumped oaf,\u201d Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, a mere squire and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. The lance was a knight\u2019s weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Harrenhal and the council.\nI hope he falls and shames himself, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills him. When Joffrey proclaimed her father\u2019s death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard\u2019s severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed.\nMorros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork. On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward, and Ser Balon\u2019s point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped his lance, fought for balance, and lost. One foot caught in a stirrup as he fell, and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists, head bouncing against the ground. Joff hooted derision. Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse, they found him bloodied but alive. \u201cTommen, we picked the wrong foe for you,\u201d the king told his brother. \u201cThe straw knight jousts better than that one.\u201d\nNext came Ser Horas Redwyne\u2019s turn. He fared better than his twin, vanquishing an elderly knight whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blue-and-white field. Splendid as he looked, the old man made a poor contest of it. Joffrey curled his lip. \u201cThis is a feeble show.\u201d\n\u201cI warned you,\u201d said the Hound. \u201cGnats.\u201d\nThe king was growing bored. It made Sansa anxious. She lowered her eyes and resolved to keep quiet, no matter what. When Joffrey Baratheon\u2019s mood darkened, any chance word might set off one of his rages.\n\u201cLothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish,\u201d cried the herald. \u201cSer Dontos the Red, of House Hollard. \u201c\nThe freerider, a small man in dented plate without device, duly appeared at the west end of the yard, but of his opponent there was no sign. Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on it. The knight appeared a moment later, cursing and staggering, clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else. His legs were pale and skinny, and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse. The watchers roared and shouted insults. Catching his horse by the bridle, Ser Dontos tried to mount, but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup.\nBy then the crowd was howling with laughter\u2026 all but the king. Joffrey had a look in his eyes that Sansa remembered well, the same look he\u2019d had at the Great Sept of Baelor the day he pronounced death on Lord Eddard Stark. Finally Ser Dontos the Red gave it up for a bad job, sat down in the dirt, and removed his plumed helm. \u201cI lose,\u201d he shouted. \u201cFetch me some wine.\u201d\nThe king stood. \u201cA cask from the cellars! I\u2019ll see him drowned in it.\u201d\nSansa heard herself gasp. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d\nJoffrey turned his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\nSansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad? To tell him no in front of half the court? She hadn\u2019t meant to say anything, only\u2026 Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.\n\u201cDid you say I can\u2019t? Did you?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cI only meant\u2026 it would be ill luck, Your Grace\u2026 to, to kill a man on your name day.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Joffrey said. \u201cI ought to drown you with him, if you care for him so much.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for him, Your Grace.\u201d The words tumbled out desperately. \u201cDrown him or have his head off, only\u2026 kill him on the morrow, if you like, but please\u2026 not today, not on your name day. I couldn\u2019t bear for you to have ill luck\u2026 terrible luck, even for kings, the singers all say so\u2026\u201d\nJoffrey scowled. He knew she was lying, she could see it. He would make her bleed for this.\n\u201cThe girl speaks truly,\u201d the Hound rasped. \u201cWhat a man sows on his name day, he reaps throughout the year.\u201d His voice was flat, as if he did not care a whit whether the king believed him or no. Could it be true? Sansa had not known. It was just something she\u2019d said, desperate to avoid punishment.\nUnhappy, Joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at Ser Dontos. \u201cTake him away. I\u2019ll have him killed on the morrow, the fool.\u201d\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cA fool. You\u2019re so clever, to see it. He\u2019s better fitted to be a fool than a knight, isn\u2019t he? You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you. He doesn\u2019t deserve the mercy of a quick death.\u201d\nThe king studied her a moment. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not so stupid as Mother says.\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cDid you hear my lady, Dontos? From this day on, you\u2019re my new fool. You can sleep with Moon Boy and dress in motley.\u201d\nSer Dontos, sobered by his near brush with death, crawled to his knees. \u201cThank you, Your Grace. And you, my lady. Thank you.\u201d\nAs a brace of Lannister guardsmen led him off, the master of revels approached the box. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cshall I summon a new challenger for Brune, or proceed with the next tilt?\u201d\n\u201cNeither. These are gnats, not knights. I\u2019d have them all put to death, only it\u2019s my name day. The tourney is done. Get them all out of my sight.\u201d\nThe master of revels bowed, but Prince Tommen was not so obedient. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to ride against the straw man.\u201d\n\u201cNot today.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want to ride!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want.\u201d\n\u201cMother said I could ride.\u201d\n\u201cShe said,\u201d Princess Myrcella agreed.\n\u201cMother said,\u201d mocked the king. \u201cDon\u2019t be childish.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re children,\u201d Myrcella declared haughtily. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be childish.\u201d\nThe Hound laughed. \u201cShe has you there.\u201d\nJoffrey was beaten. \u201cVery well. Even my brother couldn\u2019t tilt any worse than these others. Master, bring out the quintain, Tommen wants to be a gnat.\u201d\nTommen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied, his chubby little legs pumping hard. \u201cLuck,\u201d Sansa called to him.\nThey set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the prince\u2019s pony was being saddled. Tommen\u2019s opponent was a child-sized leather warrior stuffed with straw and mounted on a pivot, with a shield in one hand and a padded mace in the other. Someone had fastened a pair of antlers to the knight\u2019s head. Joffrey\u2019s father King Robert had worn antlers on his helm, Sansa remembered\u2026 but so did his uncle Lord Renly, Robert\u2019s brother, who had turned traitor and crowned himself king.\nA pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silver-and-crimson armor. A tall plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm, and the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon frolicked together on his shield. The squires helped him mount, and Ser Aron Santagar, the Red Keep\u2019s master-at-arms, stepped forward and handed Tommen a blunted silver longsword with a leaf-shaped blade, crafted to fit an eight-year-old hand.\nTommen raised the blade high. \u201cCasterly Rock!\u201d he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put his heels into his pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain. Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles started a ragged cheer, and Sansa added her voice to theirs. The king brooded in silence.\nTommen got his pony up to a brisk trot, waved his sword vigorously, and struck the knight\u2019s shield a solid blow as he went by. The quintain spun, the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of his head. Tommen spilled from the saddle, his new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as he hit the ground. His sword went flying, his pony cantered away across the bailey, and a great gale of derision went up. King Joffrey laughed longest and loudest of all.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Princess Myrcella cried. She scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother.\nSansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage. \u201cYou should go with her,\u201d she told the king. \u201cYour brother might be hurt.\u201d\nJoffrey shrugged. \u201cWhat if he is?\u201d\n\u201cYou should help him up and tell him how well he rode.\u201d Sansa could not seem to stop herself.\n\u201cHe got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt,\u201d the king pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s not riding well.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d the Hound interrupted. \u201cThe boy has courage. He\u2019s going to try again.\u201d\nThey were helping Prince Tommen mount his pony. If only Tommen were the elder instead of Joffrey, Sansa thought. I wouldn\u2019t mind marrying Tommen.\nThe sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise. Chains rattled as the portcullis was drawn upward, and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges. \u201cWho told them to open the gate?\u201d Joff demanded. With the troubles in the city, the gates of the Red Keep had been closed for days.\nA column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter of hooves. Clegane stepped close to the king, one hand on the hilt of his longsword. The visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty, yet the standard they carried was the lion of Lannister, golden on its crimson field. A few wore the red cloaks and mail of Lannister men-at-arms, but more were freeriders and sellswords, armored in oddments and bristling with sharp steel\u2026 and there were others, monstrous savages out of one of Old Nan\u2019s tales, the scary ones Bran used to love. They were clad in shabby skins and boiled leather, with long hair and fierce beards. Some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or wrapped around their hands, and others were missing eyes, ears, and fingers.\nIn their midst, riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front, was the queen\u2019s dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister, the one they called the Imp. He had let his beard grow to cover his pushed-in face, until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair, coarse as wire. Down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak, black fur striped with white. He held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling, but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he had visited Winterfell. With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes, he was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon.\nYet Tommen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard, shouting with glee. One of the savages, a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers, scooped the boy out of his saddle, armor and all, and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle. Tommen\u2019s breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion clapped him on the backplate, and Sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height. Myrcella came running after her brother, and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun her in a circle, squealing.\nWhen he lowered her back to the ground, the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came waddling across the yard toward Joffrey. Two of his men followed close behind him; a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat, and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been. Tommen and Myrcella trailed after them.\nThe dwarf went to one knee before the king. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Joffrey said.\n\u201cMe,\u201d the Imp agreed, \u201calthough a more courteous greeting might be in order, for an uncle and an elder.\u201d\n\u201cThey said you were dead,\u201d the Hound said.\nThe little man gave the big one a look. One of his eyes was green, one was black, and both were cool. \u201cI was speaking to the king, not to his cur.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead,\u201d said Princess Myrcella.\n\u201cWe share that view, sweet child.\u201d Tyrion turned to Sansa. \u201cMy lady, I am sorry for your losses. Truly, the gods are cruel.\u201d\nSansa could not think of a word to say to him. How could he be sorry for her losses? Was he mocking her? It wasn\u2019t the gods who\u2019d been cruel, it was Joffrey.\n\u201cI am sorry for your loss as well, Joffrey,\u201d the dwarf said.\n\u201cWhat loss?\u201d\n\u201cYour royal father? A large fierce man with a black beard; you\u2019ll recall him if you try. He was king before you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what \u2018they\u2019 say, Your Grace?\u201d\nJoffrey frowned. Sansa felt that she ought to say something. What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? A lady\u2019s armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry my lady mother took you captive, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cA great many people are sorry for that,\u201d Tyrion replied, \u201cand before I am done, some may be a deal sorrier\u2026 yet I thank you for the sentiment. Joffrey, where might I find your mother?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s with my council,\u201d the king answered. \u201cYour brother Jaime keeps losing battles.\u201d He gave Sansa an angry look, as if it were her fault. \u201cHe\u2019s been taken by the Starks and we\u2019ve lost Riverrun and now her stupid brother is calling himself a king.\u201d\nThe dwarf smiled crookedly. \u201cAll sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days.\u201d\nJoff did not know what to make of that, though he looked suspicious and out of sorts. \u201cYes. Well. I am pleased you\u2019re not dead, Uncle. Did you bring me a gift for my name day?\u201d\n\u201cI did. My wits.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner have Robb Stark\u2019s head,\u201d Joff said with a sly glance at Sansa. \u201cTommen, Myrcella, come.\u201d\nSandor Clegane lingered behind a moment. \u201cI\u2019d guard that tongue of yours, little man,\u201d he warned, before he strode off after his liege.\nSansa was left with the dwarf and his monsters. She tried to think of what else she might say. \u201cYou hurt your arm,\u201d she managed at last.\n\u201cOne of your northmen hit me with a morningstar during the battle on the Green Fork. I escaped him by falling off my horse.\u201d His grin turned into something softer as he studied her face. \u201cIs it grief for your lord father that makes you so sad?\u201d\n\u201cMy father was a traitor,\u201d Sansa said at once. \u201cAnd my brother and lady mother are traitors as well.\u201d That reflex she had learned quickly. \u201cI am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt. As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves.\u201d\n\u201cLions,\u201d she whispered, without thinking. She glanced about nervously, but there was no one close enough to hear.\nLannister reached out and took her hand, and gave it a squeeze. \u201cI am only a little lion, child, and I vow, I shall not savage you.\u201d Bowing, he said \u201cBut now you must excuse me. I have urgent business with queen and council.\u201d\nSansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than Joffrey, she thought, but the queen spoke to me gently too. He\u2019s still a Lannister, her brother and Joff\u2019s uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with her father\u2019s head. Sansa would never make that mistake again.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nIn the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in a shroud. \u201cHer Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed.\u201d\n\u201cI would be only a small disturbance, ser.\u201d Tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve. \u201cI bear a letter from my father, Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King. There is his seal.\u201d\n\u201cHer Grace does not wish to be disturbed,\u201d Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion were a dullard who had not heard him the first time.\nJaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard\u2014excepting himself, always\u2014because his face gave no hint as what he might do next. Tyrion would have welcomed a hint. Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords, but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of Joffrey\u2019s protectors. Yet if he let the man turn him away, where was his authority? He made himself smile. \u201cSer Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who was captain of Lord Arryn\u2019s household guard?\u201d\n\u201cI know the man.\u201d Ser Mandon\u2019s eyes were pale grey, oddly flat and lifeless.\n\u201cKnew,\u201d Bronn corrected with a thin smile.\nSer Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that.\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Tyrion said lightly, \u201cI truly must see my sister and present my letter, ser. If you would be so kind as to open the door for us?\u201d\nThe white knight did not respond. Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his way past when Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside. \u201cYou may enter. They may not.\u201d\nA small victory, he thought, but sweet. He had passed his first test. Tyrion Lannister shouldered through the door, feeling almost tall. Five members of the king\u2019s small council broke off their discussion suddenly. \u201cYou,\u201d his sister Cersei said in a tone that was equal parts disbelief and distaste.\n\u201cI can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies.\u201d Tyrion paused to admire the pair of Valyrian sphinxes that guarded the door, affecting an air of casual confidence. Cersei could smell weakness the way a dog smells fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d His sister\u2019s lovely green eyes studied him without the least hint of affection.\n\u201cDelivering a letter from our lord father.\u201d He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled parchment between them.\nThe eunuch Varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands. \u201cHow kind of Lord Tywin. And his scaling wax is such a lovely shade of gold.\u201d Varys gave the seal a close inspection. \u201cIt gives every appearance of being genuine.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s genuine.\u201d Cersei snatched it out of his hands. She broke the wax and unrolled the parchment.\nTyrion watched her read. His sister had taken the king\u2019s seat for herself\u2014he gathered Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had\u2014so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand\u2019s chair. it seemed only appropriate.\n\u201cThis is absurd,\u201d the queen said at last. \u201cMy lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this council. He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as he himself can join us.\u201d\nGrand Maester Pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously. \u201cIt would seem that a welcome is in order.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself. \u201cWe have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this grim omen in the sky, rioting in the city streets\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd whose fault is that, Lord Janos?\u201d Cersei lashed out. \u201cYour gold cloaks are charged with keeping order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m done with fields of battle, thank you. I sit a chair better than a horse, and I\u2019d sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe. All that about the thunder of the drums, sunlight flashing on armor, magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose, and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere. Not that I am complaining. Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and fly bites are my favorite things.\u201d\nLittlefinger laughed. \u201cWell said, Lannister. A man after my own heart.\u201d\nTyrion smiled at him, remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade. We must have a talk about that, and soon. He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as well. \u201cPlease,\u201d he told them, \u201cdo let me be of service, in whatever small way I can.\u201d\nCersei read the letter again. \u201cHow many men have you brought with you? \u201c\n\u201cA few hundred. My own men, chiefly. Father was loath to part with any of his. He is fighting a war, after all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city, or Stannis sails from Dragonstone? I ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf. The king names the Hand, with the consent of council. Joffrey named our lord father.\u201d\n\u201cAnd our lord father named me.\u201d\n\u201cHe cannot do that. Not without Joff\u2019s consent.\u201d\n\u201cLord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host, if you\u2019d care to take it up with him,\u201d Tyrion said politely. \u201cMy lords, perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister?\u201d\nVarys slithered to his feet, smiling in that unctuous way he had. \u201cHow you must have yearned for the sound of your sweet sister\u2019s voice. My lords, please, let us give them a few moments together. The woes of our troubled realm shall keep.\u201d\nJanos Slynt rose hesitantly and Grand Maester Pycelle ponderously, yet they rose. Littlefinger was the last. \u201cShall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegor\u2019s Holdfast?\u201d\n\u201cMy thanks, Lord Petyr, but I will be taking Lord Stark\u2019s former quarters in the Tower of the Hand.\u201d\nLittlefinger laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a braver man than me, Lannister. You do know the fate of our last two Hands?\u201d\n\u201cTwo? If you mean to frighten me, why not say four?\u201d\n\u201cFour?\u201d Littlefinger raised an eyebrow. \u201cDid the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some dire end in the Tower? I\u2019m afraid I was too young to pay them much mind.\u201d\n\u201cAerys Targaryen\u2019s last Hand was killed during the Sack of King\u2019s Landing, though I doubt he\u2019d had time to settle into the Tower. He was only Hand for a fortnight. The one before him was burned to death. And before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile, and counted themselves lucky. I believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart King\u2019s Landing with his name, properties, and parts all intact.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Littlefinger. \u201cAnd all the more reason I\u2019d sooner bed down in the dungeon.\u201d\nPerhaps you\u2019ll get that wish, Tyrion thought, but he said, \u201cCourage and folly are cousins, or so I\u2019ve heard. Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand, I pray I\u2019m small enough to escape its notice.\u201d\nJanos Slynt laughed, Littlefinger smiled, and Grand Maester Pycelle followed them both out, bowing gravely.\n\u201cI hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons,\u201d his sister said when they were alone.\n\u201cHow I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice,\u201d Tyrion sighed to her.\n\u201cHow I have yearned to have that eunuch\u2019s tongue pulled out with hot pincers,\u201d Cersei replied. \u201cHas father lost his senses? Or did you forge this letter?\u201d She read it once more, with mounting annoyance. \u201cWhy would he inflict you on me? I wanted him to come himself.\u201d She crushed Lord Tywin\u2019s letter in her fingers. \u201cI am Joffrey\u2019s regent, and I sent him a royal command!\u201d\n\u201cAnd he ignored you,\u201d Tyrion pointed out. \u201cHe has quite a large army, he can do that. Nor is he the first. Is he?\u201d\nCersei\u2019s mouth tightened. He could see her color rising. \u201cIf I name this letter a forgery and tell them to throw you in a dungeon, no one will ignore that, I promise you.\u201d\nHe was walking on rotten ice now, Tyrion knew. One false step and he would plunge through. \u201cNo one,\u201d he agreed amiably, \u201cleast of all our father. The one with the army. But why should you want to throw me into a dungeon, sweet sister, when I\u2019ve come all this long way to help you? \u201c\n\u201cI do not require your help. It was our father\u2019s presence that I commanded.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbut it\u2019s Jaime you want.\u201d\nHis sister fancied herself subtle, but he had grown up with her. He could read her face like one of his favorite books, and what he read now was rage, and fear, and despair. \u201cJaime\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is my brother no less than yours,\u201d Tyrion interrupted. \u201cGive me your support and I promise you, we will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Cersei demanded. \u201cThe Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded Lord Eddard.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Tyrion agreed, \u201cyet you still hold his daughters, don\u2019t you? I saw the older girl out in the yard with Joffrey.\u201d\n\u201cSansa,\u201d the queen said. \u201cI\u2019ve given it out that I have the younger brat as well, but it\u2019s a lie. I sent Meryn Trant to take her in hand when Robert died, but her wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled. No one has seen her since. Likely she\u2019s dead. A great many people died that day.\u201d\nTyrion had hoped for both Stark girls, but he supposed one would have to do. \u201cTell me about our friends on the council.\u201d\nHis sister glanced at the door. \u201cWhat of them?\u201d\n\u201cFather seems to have taken a dislike to them. When I left him, he was wondering how their heads might look on the wall beside Lord Stark\u2019s.\u201d He leaned forward across the table. \u201cAre you certain of their loyalty? Do you trust them?\u201d\n\u201cI trust no one,\u201d Cersei snapped. \u201cI need them. Does Father believe they are playing us false?\u201d\n\u201cSuspects, rather.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What does he know?\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cHe knows that your son\u2019s short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters. That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel.\u201d\nCersei gave him a searching look. \u201cJoff has had no lack of good counsel. He\u2019s always been strong-willed. Now that he\u2019s king, he believes he should do as he pleases, not as he\u2019s bid.\u201d\n\u201cCrowns do queer things to the heads beneath them,\u201d Tyrion agreed. \u201cThis business with Eddard Stark\u2026 Joffrey\u2019s work?\u201d\nThe queen grimaced. \u201cHe was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow him to take the black. The man would have been out of our way forever, and we might have made peace with that son of his, but Joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show. What was I to do? He called for Lord Eddard\u2019s head in front of half the city. And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me!\u201d Her hand tightened into a fist. \u201cThe High Septon claims we profaned Baelor\u2019s Sept with blood, after lying to him about our intent.\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem he has a point,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cSo this Lord Slynt, he was part of it, was he? Tell me, whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council?\u201d\n\u201cLittlefinger made the arrangements. We needed Slynt\u2019s gold cloaks. Eddard Stark was plotting with Renly and he\u2019d written to Lord Stannis, offering him the throne. We might have lost all. Even so, it was a close thing. If Sansa hadn\u2019t come to me and told me all her father\u2019s plans\u2026\u201d\nTyrion was surprised. \u201cTruly? His own daughter?\u201d Sansa had always seemed such a sweet child, tender and courteous.\n\u201cThe girl was wet with love. She would have done anything for Joffrey, until he cut off her father\u2019s head and called it mercy. That put an end to that.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects,\u201d Tyrion said with a crooked smile. \u201cWas it Joffrey\u2019s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too?\u201d\nCersei sighed. \u201cJoff wanted someone to blame for Robert\u2019s death. Varys suggested Ser Barristan. Why not? It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council, and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog. He is very fond of Sandor Clegane. We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse, more than the useless old fool deserved.\u201d\n\u201cI hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt\u2019s gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud Gate.\u201d\nHis sister looked very unhappy. \u201cJanos should have sent more men. He is not as competent as might be wished.\u201d\n\u201cSer Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon\u2019s Kingsguard,\u201d Tyrion reminded her pointedly. \u201cHe and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen\u2019s seven. The smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. What do you imagine they\u2019ll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon?\u201d\nCersei glanced away. \u201cI had not considered that.\u201d\n\u201cFather did,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThat is why he sent me. To put an end to these follies and bring your son to heel.\u201d\n\u201cJoff will be no more tractable for you than for me.\u201d\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\u201cHe knows you would never hurt him.\u201d\nCersei\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you believe I\u2019d ever allow you to harm my son, you\u2019re sick with fever.\u201d\nTyrion sighed. She\u2019d missed the point, as she did so often. \u201cJoffrey is as safe with me as he is with you,\u201d he assured her, \u201cbut so long as the boy feels threatened, he\u2019ll be more inclined to listen.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cI am your brother, you know. You need me, whether you care to admit it or no. Your son needs me, if he\u2019s to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair.\u201d\nHis sister seemed shocked that he would touch her. \u201cYou have always been cunning.\u201d\n\u201cIn my own small way.\u201d He grinned.\n\u201cIt may be worth the trying\u2026 but make no mistake, Tyrion. If I accept you, you shall be the King\u2019s Hand in name, but my Hand in truth. You will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act, and you will do nothing without my consent. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you agree?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d he lied. \u201cI am yours, sister.\u201d For as long as I need to be. \u201cSo, now that we are of one purpose, we ought have no more secrets between us. You say Joffrey had Lord Eddard killed, Varys dismissed Ser Barristan, and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt. Who murdered Jon Arryn? \u201c\nCersei yanked her hand back. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d\n\u201cThe grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me. Where did she come by that notion, I wonder?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know. That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing. He hinted that Lord Arryn suspected or\u2026 well, believed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat you were fucking our sweet Jaime?\u201d\nShe slapped him.\n\u201cDid you think I was as blind as Father?\u201d Tyrion rubbed his cheek. \u201cWho you lie with is no matter to me\u2026 although it doesn\u2019t seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other.\u201d\nShe slapped him.\n\u201cBe gentle, Cersei, I\u2019m only jesting with you. If truth be told, I\u2019d sooner have a nice whore. I never understood what Jaime saw in you, apart from his own reflection.\u201d\nShe slapped him.\nHis cheeks were red and burning, yet he smiled. \u201cIf you keep doing that, I may get angry.\u201d\nThat stayed her hand. \u201cWhy should I care if you do?\u201d\n\u201cI have some new friends,\u201d Tyrion confessed. \u201cYou won\u2019t like them at all. How did you kill Robert?\u201d\n\u201cHe did that himself. All we did was help. When Lancel saw that Robert was going after boar, he gave him strongwine. His favorite sour red, but fortified, three times as potent as he was used to. The great stinking fool loved it. He could have stopped swilling it down anytime he cared to, but no, he drained one skin and told Lancel to fetch another. The boar did the rest. You should have been at the feast, Tyrion. There has never been a boar so delicious. They cooked it with mushrooms and apples, and it tasted like triumph.\u201d\n\u201cTruly, sister, you were born to be a widow.\u201d Tyrion had rather liked Robert Baratheon, great blustering oaf that he was\u2026 doubtless in part because his sister loathed him so. \u201cNow, if you are done slapping me, I will be off.\u201d He twisted his legs around and clambered down awkwardly from the chair.\nCersei frowned. \u201cI haven\u2019t given you leave to depart. I want to know how you intend to free Jaime.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I know. Schemes are like fruit, they require a certain ripening. Right now, I have a mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city.\u201d Tyrion rested his hand on the head of the sphinx beside the door. \u201cOne parting request. Kindly make certain no harm comes to Sansa Stark. It would not do to lose both the daughters.\u201d\nOutside the council chamber, Tyrion nodded to Ser Mandon and made his way down the long vaulted hall. Bronn fell in beside him. Of Timett son of Timett there was no sign. \u201cWhere\u2019s our red hand?\u201d Tyrion asked.\n\u201cHe felt an urge to explore. His kind was not made for waiting about in halls.\u201d\n\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t kill anyone important.\u201d The clansmen Tyrion had brought down from their fastnesses in the Mountains of the Moon were loyal in their own fierce way, but they were proud and quarrelsome as well, prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel. \u201cTry to find him. And while you are at it, see that the rest have been quartered and fed. I want them in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand, but don\u2019t let the steward put the Stone Crows near the Moon Brothers, and tell him the Burned Men must have a hall all to themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m riding back to the Broken Anvil.\u201d\nBronn grinned insolently. \u201cNeed an escort? The talk is, the streets are dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll call upon the captain of my sister\u2019s household guard, and remind him that I am no less a Lannister than she is. He needs to recall that his oath is to Casterly Rock, not to Cersei or Joffrey.\u201d\nAn hour later, Tyrion rode from the Red Keep accompanied by a dozen Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms. As they passed beneath the portcullis, he noted the heads mounted atop the walls. Black with rot and old tar, they had long since become unrecognizable. \u201cCaptain Vylarr,\u201d he called, \u201cI want those taken down on the morrow. Give them to the silent sisters for cleaning.\u201d It would be hell to match them with the bodies, he supposed, yet it must be done. Even in the midst of war certain decencies needed to be observed.\nVylarr grew hesitant. \u201cHis Grace has told us he wishes the traitors\u2019 heads to remain on the walls until he fills those last three empty spikes there on the end.\u201d\n\u201cLet me hazard a wild stab. One is for Robb Stark, the others for Lords Stannis and Renly. Would that be right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cMy nephew is thirteen years old today, Vylarr. Try and recall that. I\u2019ll have the heads down on the morrow, or one of those empty spikes may have a different lodger. Do you take my meaning, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that they\u2019re taken down myself, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted away, leaving the red cloaks to follow as best they could.\nHe had told Cersei he intended to take the measure of the city. That was not entirely a lie. Tyrion Lannister was not pleased by much of what he saw. The streets of King\u2019s Landing had always been teeming and raucous and noisy, but now they reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past visits. A naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the Street of Looms, being torn at by a pack of feral dogs, yet no one seemed to care. Watchmen were much in evidence, moving in pairs through the alleys in their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail, iron cudgels never far from their hands. The markets were crowded with ragged men selling their household goods for any price they could get\u2026 and conspicuously empty of farmers selling food. What little produce he did see was three times as costly as it had been a year ago. One peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer. \u201cFresh rats,\u201d he cried loudly, \u201cfresh rats.\u201d Doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats. The frightening thing was, the rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling. On the Street of Flour, Tyrion saw guards at every other shop door. When times grew lean, even bakers found sellswords cheaper than bread, he reflected.\n\u201cThere is no food coming in, is there?\u201d he said to Vylarr.\n\u201cLittle enough,\u201d the captain admitted. \u201cWith the war in the riverlands and Lord Renly raising rebels in Highgarden, the roads are closed to south and west.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what has my good sister done about this?\u201d\n\u201cShe is taking steps to restore the king\u2019s peace,\u201d Vylarr assured him. \u201cLord Slynt has tripled the size of the City Watch, and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our defenses. The stonemasons are strengthening the walls, carpenters are building scorpions and catapults by the hundred, fletchers are making arrows, the smiths are forging blades, and the Alchemists\u2019 Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of wildfire.\u201d\nTyrion shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. He was pleased that Cersei had not been idle, but wildfire was treacherous stuff, and ten thousand jars were enough to turn all of King\u2019s Landing into cinders. \u201cWhere has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this?\u201d It was no secret that King Robert had left the crown vastly in debt, and alchemists were seldom mistaken for altruists.\n\u201cLord Littlefinger always finds a way, my lord. He has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that would work,\u201d Tyrion said, thinking, Clever. Clever and cruel. Tens of thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of King\u2019s Landing. He had seen them on the kingsroad, troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes. Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war\u2026 though they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire.\nThe inn beneath the sign of the broken anvil stood within sight of those walls, near the Gate of the Gods where they had entered that morning. As they rode into its courtyard, a boy ran out to help Tyrion down from his horse. \u201cTake your men back to the castle,\u201d he told Vylarr. \u201cI\u2019ll be spending the night here.\u201d\nThe captain looked dubious. \u201cWill you be safe, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cWell, as to that, Captain, when I left the inn this morning it was full of Black Ears. One is never quite safe when Chella daughter of Cheyk is about.\u201d Tyrion waddled toward the door, leaving Vylarr to puzzle at his meaning.\nA gust of merriment greeted him as he shoved into the inn\u2019s common room. He recognized Chella\u2019s throaty chuckle and the lighter music of Shae\u2019s laughter. The girl was seated by the hearth, sipping wine at a round wooden table with three of the Black Ears he\u2019d left to guard her and a plump man whose back was to him. The innkeeper, he assumed\u2026 until Shae called Tyrion by name and the intruder rose. \u201cMy good lord, I am so pleased to see you,\u201d he gushed, a soft eunuch\u2019s smile on his powdered face.\nTyrion stumbled. \u201cLord Varys. I had not thought to see you here.\u201d The Others take him, how did he find them so quickly?\n\u201cForgive me if I intrude,\u201d Varys said. \u201cI was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady.\u201d\n\u201cYoung lady,\u201d Shae repeated, savoring the words. \u201cYou\u2019re half right, m\u2019lord. I\u2019m young.\u201d\nEighteen, Tyrion thought. Eighteen, and a whore, but quick of wit, nimble as a cat between the sheets, with large dark eyes and fine black hair and a sweet, soft, hungry little mouth\u2026 and mine! Damn you, eunuch. \u201cI fear I\u2019m the intruder, Lord Varys,\u201d he said with forced courtesy. \u201cWhen I came in, you were in the midst of some merriment.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a fine necklace,\u201d Shae explained. It grated on him to hear her call Varys m\u2019lord in that tone; that was what she called him in their pillow play. \u201cAnd Chella told him only cowards kill the vanquished.\u201d\n\u201cBraver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse his shame by winning back his ear,\u201d explained Chella, a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less than forty-six dried, wrinkled ears. Tyrion had counted them once. \u201cOnly so can you prove you do not fear your enemies.\u201d\nShae hooted. \u201cAnd then m\u2019lord says if he was a Black Ear he\u2019d never sleep, for dreams of one-eared men.\u201d\n\u201cA problem I will never need face,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of my enemies, so I kill them all.\u201d\nVarys giggled. \u201cWill you take some wine with us, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take some wine.\u201d Tyrion seated himself beside Shae. He understood what was happening here, if Chella and the girl did not. Varys was delivering a message. When he said, I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady, what he meant was, You tried to hide her, but I knew where she was, and who she was, and here I am. He wondered who had betrayed him. The innkeeper, that boy in the stable, a guard on the gate\u2026 or one of his own?\n\u201cI always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods,\u201d Varys told Shae as he filled the wine cups. \u201cThe carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite, they make me weep each time I see them. The eyes\u2026 so expressive, don\u2019t you think? They almost seem to follow you as you ride beneath the portcullis.\u201d\n\u201cI never noticed, m\u2019lord,\u201d Shae replied. \u201cI\u2019ll look again on the morrow, if it please you.\u201d\nDon\u2019t bother, sweetling, Tyrion thought, swirling the wine in the cup. He cares not a whit about carvings. The eyes he boasts of are his own. What he means is that he was watching, that he knew we were here the moment we passed through the gates.\n\u201cDo be careful, child,\u201d Varys urged. \u201cKing\u2019s Landing is not wholly safe these days. I know these streets well, and yet I almost feared to come today, alone and unarmed as I was. Lawless men are everywhere in this dark time, oh, yes. Men with cold steel and colder hearts.\u201d Where I can come alone and unarmed, others can come with swords in their fists, he was saying.\nShae only laughed. \u201cIf they try and bother me, they\u2019ll be one ear short when Chella runs them off.\u201d\nVarys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but there was no laughter in his eyes when he turned them on Tyrion. \u201cYour young lady has an amiable way to her. I should take very good care of her if I were you.\u201d\n\u201cI intend to. Any man who tries to harm her\u2014well, I\u2019m too small to be a Black Ear, and I make no claims to courage.\u201d See? I speak the same tongue you do, eunuch. Hurt her, and I\u2019ll have your head.\n\u201cI will leave you.\u201d Varys rose. \u201cI know how weary you must be. I only wished to welcome you, my lord, and tell you how very pleased I am by your arrival. We have dire need of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m short, not blind,\u201d Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining the crescent moon.\n\u201cIn the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,\u201d Varys said. \u201cThey say it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.\u201d The eunuch rubbed his powdered hands together. \u201cMay I leave you with a bit of a riddle, Lord Tyrion?\u201d He did not wait for an answer. \u201cIn a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. \u2018Do it\u2019 says the king, \u2018for I am your lawful ruler.\u2019 \u2018Do it\u2019 says the priest, \u2018for I command you in the names of the gods.\u2019 \u2018Do it\u2019 says the rich man, \u2018and all this gold shall be yours.\u2019 So tell me\u2014who lives and who dies?\u201d Bowing deeply, the eunuch hurried from the common room on soft slippered feet.\nWhen he was gone, Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up her pretty face. \u201cThe rich man lives. Doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nTyrion sipped at his wine, thoughtful. \u201cPerhaps. Or not. That would depend on the sellsword, it seems.\u201d He set down his cup. \u201cCome, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d\nShe had to wait for him at the top of the steps, for her legs were slim and supple while his were short and stunted and full of aches. But she was smiling when he reached her. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d she teased as she took his hand.\n\u201cDesperately,\u201d Tyrion admitted. Shae only stood a shade over five feet, yet still he must look up to her\u2026 but in her case he found he did not mind. She was sweet to look up at.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss me all the time in your Red Keep,\u201d she said as she led him to her room. \u201cAll alone in your cold bed in your Tower of the Hand.\u201d\n\u201cToo true.\u201d Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him, but his lord father had forbidden it. You will not take the whore to court, Lord Tywin had commanded. Bringing her to the city was as much defiance as he dared. All his authority derived from his father, the girl had to understand that. \u201cYou won\u2019t be far,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a house, with guards and servants, and I\u2019ll visit as often as I\u2019m able.\u201d\nShae kicked shut the door. Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window, he could make out the Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya\u2019s Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a different sight. Bending, Shae took her gown by the hem, drew it over her head, and tossed it aside. She did not believe in smallclothes. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to rest,\u201d she said as she stood before him, pink and nude and lovely, one hand braced on her hip. \u201cYou\u2019ll think of me every time you go to bed. Then you\u2019ll get hard and you\u2019ll have no one to help you and you\u2019ll never be able to sleep unless you\u201d\u2014she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well\u2014\u201cis that why they call it the Tower of the Hand, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet and kiss me,\u201d he commanded.\nHe could taste the wine on her lips, and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches. \u201cMy lion,\u201d she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress. \u201cMy sweet lord, my giant of Lannister.\u201d Tyrion pushed her toward the bed. When he entered her, she screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb, and her nails left gouges in his back. He\u2019d never had a pain he liked half so well.\nFool, he thought to himself afterward, as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets. Will you never learn, dwarf? She\u2019s a whore, damn you, it\u2019s your coin she loves, not your cock. Remember Tysha? Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple, it stiffened at the touch, and he could see the mark on her breast where he\u2019d bitten her in his passion.\n\u201cSo what will you do, m\u2019lord, now that you\u2019re the Hand of the King?\u201d Shae asked him as he cupped that warm sweet flesh.\n\u201cSomething Cersei will never expect,\u201d Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck. \u201cI\u2019ll do\u2026 justice.\u201d",

      "content": "Bran\nBran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets. Abed, the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him; abed, the room was his cell, and Winterfell his prison. Yet outside his window, the wide world still called.\nHe could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had, but he could still look. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars.\nOf late, he often dreamed of wolves. They are talking to me, brother to brother, he told himself when the direwolves howled. He could almost understand them\u2026 not quite, not truly, but almost\u2026 as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten. The Walders might be scared of them, but the Starks had wolf blood. Old Nan told him so. \u201cThough it is stronger in some than in others,\u201d she warned.\nSummer\u2019s howls were long and sad, full of grief and longing. Shaggydog\u2019s were more savage. Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell, instead of only two\u2026 two where there had once been six. Do they miss their brothers and sisters too? Bran wondered. Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost, to Nymeria and Lady\u2019s Shade? Do they want them to come home and be a pack together?\n\u201cWho can know the mind of a wolf?\u201d Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled. Bran\u2019s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and his duties left him little time for idle questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s freedom they\u2019re calling for,\u201d declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. \u201cThey don\u2019t like being walled up, and who\u2019s to blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle.\u201d\n\u201cThey want to hunt,\u201d agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew. \u201cA wolf smells better\u2019n any man. Like as not, they\u2019ve caught the scent o\u2019 prey.\u201d\nMaester Luwin did not think so. \u201cWolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.\u201d\nWhen Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. \u201cYour wolves have more wit than your maester,\u201d the wildling woman said. \u201cThey know truths the grey man has forgotten.\u201d The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201cBlood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d\nBran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. \u201cIt is the sword that slays the season,\u201d he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.\nThough Old Nan did not think so, and she\u2019d lived longer than any of them. \u201cDragons,\u201d she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. \u201cIt be dragons, boy,\u201d she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.\nHodor said only, \u201cHodor.\u201d That was all he ever said.\nAnd still the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran\u2019s window. Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see them.\nHe could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther back the First Keep, squat and round, its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk. Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends.\nAnd then he had fallen.\nBran did not remember falling, yet they said he had, so he supposed it must be true. He had almost died. When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened, he got a queer tight feeling in his belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor run nor swordfight, and the dreams he\u2019d dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head.\nSummer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father\u2019s death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester\u2019s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls.\nWho are they mourning now? Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think?\nIf I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be.\n\u201cOooo,\u201d Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet. \u201cOoooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo,\u201d he howled. it sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy\u2019s howl, not a wolf\u2019s. Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran\u2019s thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their pack.\nThe noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, saw Bran howling out the window, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this, my prince?\u201d\nIt made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb\u2019s heir, and Robb was King in the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. \u201cOooooooo. Oo-oo-oooooooooooo.\u201d\nHayhead screwed up his face. \u201cNow you stop that there.\u201d\n\u201cOoo-ooo-Oooooo. Ooo-Ooo-Ooooooooooooooooo.\u201d\nThe guardsman retreated. When he came back, Maester Luwin was with him, all in grey, his chain tight about his neck. \u201cBran, those beasts make sufficient noise without your help.\u201d He crossed the room and put his hand on the boy\u2019s brow. \u201cThe hour grows late, you ought to be fast asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to the wolves.\u201d Bran brushed the hand away.\n\u201cShall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed?\u201d\n\u201cI can get to bed myself.\u201d Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall, so Bran could pull himself about the room with his arms. It was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache, but he hated being carried. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have to sleep if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cAll men must sleep, Bran. Even princes.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I sleep I turn into a wolf.\u201d Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night. \u201cDo wolves dream?\u201d\n\u201cAll creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do.\u201d\n\u201cDo dead men dream?\u201d Bran asked, thinking of his father. In the dark crypts below Winterfell, a stonemason was chiseling out his father\u2019s likeness in granite.\n\u201cSome say yes, some no,\u201d the maester answered. \u201cThe dead themselves are silent on the matter.\u201d\n\u201cDo trees dream?\u201d\n\u201cTrees? No\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey do,\u201d Bran said with sudden certainty. \u201cThey dream tree dreams. I dream of a tree sometimes. A weirwood, like the one in the godswood. It calls to me. The wolf dreams are better. I smell things, and sometimes I can taste the blood.\u201d\nMaester Luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck. \u201cIf you would only spend more time with the other children\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI hate the other children,\u201d Bran said, meaning the Walders. \u201cI commanded you to send them away.\u201d\nLuwin grew stern. \u201cThe Freys are your lady mother\u2019s wards, sent here to be fostered at her express command. It is not for you to expel them, nor is it kind. If we turned them out, where would they go?\u201d\n\u201cHome. It\u2019s their fault you won\u2019t let me have Summer.\u201d\n\u201cThe Frey boy did not ask to be attacked,\u201d the maester said, \u201cno more than I did.\u201d\n\u201cThat was Shaggydog.\u201d Rickon\u2019s big black wolf was so wild he even frightened Bran at times. \u201cSummer never bit anyone.\u201d\n\u201cSummer ripped out a man\u2019s throat in this very chamber, or have you forgotten? The truth is, those sweet pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous beasts. The Frey boys are wise to be wary of them.\u201d\n\u201cWe should put the Walders in the godswood. They could play lord of the crossing all they want, and Summer could sleep with me again. If I\u2019m the prince, why won\u2019t you heed me? I wanted to ride Dancer, but Alebelly wouldn\u2019t let me past the gate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd rightly so. The wolfswood is full of danger; your last ride should have taught you that. Would you want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters?\u201d\n\u201cSummer would save me,\u201d Bran insisted stubbornly. \u201cPrinces should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances.\u201d\n\u201cBran, child, why do you torment yourself so? One day you may do some of these things, but now you are only a boy of eight.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa. I\u2019d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I\u2019d fight beside him like Grey Wind. I\u2019d tear out the Kingslayer\u2019s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone would come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf\u2026\u201d He howled. \u201cOoo-ooo-oooooooooooo.\u201d\nLuwin raised his voice. \u201cA true prince would welcome\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAAHOOOOOOO,\u201d Bran howled, louder. \u201cAAHOOOOOOOOOOOO.\u201d\nThe maester surrendered. \u201cAs you will, child.\u201d With a look that was part grief and part disgust, he left the bedchamber.\nHowling lost its savor once Bran was alone. After a time he quieted. I did welcome them, he told himself, resentful. I was the lord in Winterfell, a true lord, he can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t. When the Walders had arrived from the Twins, it had been Rickon who wanted them gone. A baby of four, he had screamed that he wanted Mother and Father and Robb, not these strangers. It had been up to Bran to soothe him and bid the Freys welcome. He had offered them meat and mead and a seat by the fire, and even Maester Luwin had said afterward that he\u2019d done well.\nOnly that was before the game.\nThe game was played with a log, a staff, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The water was the most important, Walder and Walder assured Bran. You could use a plank or even a series of stones, and a branch could be your staff. You didn\u2019t have to shout. But without water, there was no game. As Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream, they made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood. Walder and Walder had never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before, but they both allowed how it would make the game even better.\nBoth of them were called Walder Frey. Big Walder said there were bunches of Walders at the Twins, all named after the boys\u2019 grandfather, Lord Walder Frey. \u201cWe have our own names at Winterfell,\u201d Rickon told them haughtily when he heard that.\nThe way their game was played, you laid the log across the water, and one player stood in the middle with the stick. He was the lord of the crossing, and when one of the other players came up, he had to say, \u201cI am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?\u201d And the other player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions. They didn\u2019t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said \u201cMaybaps,\u201d so the trick was to say \u201cMayhaps\u201d so the lord of the crossing didn\u2019t notice. Then you could try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing, but only if you\u2019d said \u201cMayhaps.\u201d Otherwise you were out of the game. The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he pleased, and he was the only one who got to use a stick.\nIn practice, the game seemed to come down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water, along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone had said \u201cMayhaps.\u201d Little Walder was lord of the crossing more often than not.\nHe was Little Walder even though he was tall and stout, with a red face and a big round belly. Big Walder was sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. \u201cHe\u2019s fifty-two days older than me,\u201d Little Walder explained, \u201cso he was bigger at first, but I grew faster.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re cousins, not brothers,\u201d added Big Walder, the little one. \u201cI\u2019m Walder son of Jammos. My father was Lord Walder\u2019s son by his fourth wife. He\u2019s Walder son of Merrett. His grandmother was Lord Walder\u2019s third wife, the Crakehall. He\u2019s ahead of me in the line of succession even though I\u2019m older.\u201d\n\u201cOnly by fifty-two days,\u201d Little Walder objected. \u201cAnd neither of us will ever hold the Twins, stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Big Walder declared. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only Walders either. Ser Stevron has a grandson, Black Walder, he\u2019s fourth in line of succession, and there\u2019s Red Walder, Ser Emmon\u2019s son, and Bastard Walder, who isn\u2019t in the line at all. He\u2019s called Walder Rivers not Walder Frey. Plus there\u2019s girls named Walda.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tyr. You always forget Tyr.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s Waltyr, not Walder,\u201d Big Walder said airily. \u201cAnd he\u2019s after us, so he doesn\u2019t matter. Anyhow, I never liked him.\u201d\nSer Rodrik decreed that they would share Jon Snow\u2019s old bedchamber, since Jon was in the Night\u2019s Watch and never coming back. Bran hated that; it made him feel as if the Freys were trying to steal Jon\u2019s place.\nHe had watched wistfully while the Walders contested with Turnip the cook\u2019s boy and Joseth\u2019s girls Bandy and Shyra. The Walders had decreed that Bran should be the judge and decide whether or not people had said \u201cMayhaps,\u201d but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him.\nThe shouts and splashes soon drew others: Palla the kennel girl, Cayn\u2019s boy Calon, Tom Too whose father Fat Tom had died with Bran\u2019s father at King\u2019s Landing. Before very long, every one of them was soaked and muddy. Palla was brown from head to heel, with moss in her hair, breathless from laughter. Bran had not heard so much laughing since the night the bloody raven came. If I had my legs, I\u2019d knock all of them into the water, he thought bitterly. No one would ever be lord of the crossing but me.\nFinally Rickon came running into the godswood, Shaggydog at his heels. He watched Turnip and Little Walder struggle for the stick until Turnip lost his footing and went in with a huge splash, arms waving. Rickon yelled, \u201cMe! Me now! I want to play!\u201d Little Walder beckoned him on, and Shaggydog started to follow. \u201cNo, Shaggy,\u201d his brother commanded. \u201cWolves can\u2019t play. You stay with Bran.\u201d And he did\u2026\n\u2026until Little Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly. Before Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was blood in the water, the Walders were shrieking red murder, Rickon sat in the mud laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting \u201cHodor! Hodor! Hodor!\u201d\nAfter that, oddly, Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, but they played other games\u2014monsters and maidens, rats and cats, come-into-my-castle, all sorts of things. With Rickon by their side, the Walders plundered the kitchens for pies and honeycombs, raced round the walls, tossed bones to the pups in the kennels, and trained with wooden swords under Ser Rodrik\u2019s sharp eye. Rickon even showed them the deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason was carving father\u2019s tomb. \u201cYou had no right!\u201d Bran screamed at his brother when he heard. \u201cThat was our place, a Stark place!\u201d But Rickon never cared.\nThe door to his bedchamber opened. Maester Luwin was carrying a green jar, and this time Osha and Hayhead came with him. \u201cI\u2019ve made you a sleeping draught, Bran.\u201d\nOsha scooped him up in her bony arms. She was very tall for a woman, and wiry strong. She bore him effortlessly to his bed.\n\u201cThis will give you dreamless sleep,\u201d Maester Luwin said as he pulled the stopper from the jar. \u201cSweet, dreamless sleep.\u201d\n\u201cIt will?\u201d Bran said, wanting to believe.\n\u201cYes. Drink.\u201d\nBran drank. The potion was thick and chalky, but there was honey in it so it went down easy.\n\u201cCome the morn, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d Luwin gave Bran a smile and a pat as he took his leave.\nOsha lingered behind. \u201cIs it the wolf dreams again?\u201d\nBran nodded.\n\u201cYou should not fight so hard, boy. I see you talking to the heart tree. Might be the gods are trying to talk back.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods?\u201d he murmured, drowsy already. Osha\u2019s face grew blurry and grey. Sweet, dreamless sleep, Bran thought.\nYet when the darkness closed over him, he found himself in the godswood, moving silently beneath green-grey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time. I am walking, he thought, exulting. Part of him knew that it was only a dream, but even the dream of walking was better than the truth of his bedchamber, walls and ceiling and door.\nIt was dark amongst the trees, but the comet lit his way, and his feet were sure. He was moving on four good legs, strong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of fallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. It was a good feeling.\nThe smells filled his head, alive and intoxicating; the green muddy stink of the hot pools, the perfume of rich rotting earth beneath his paws, the squirrels in the oaks. The scent of squirrel made him remember the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack between his teeth. Slaver filled his mouth. He had eaten no more than half a day past, but there was no joy in dead meat, even deer. He could hear the squirrels chittering and rustling above him, safe among their leaves, but they knew better than to come down to where his brother and he were prowling.\nHe could smell his brother too, a familiar scent, strong and earthy, his scent as black as his coat. His brother was loping around the walls, full of fury. Round and round he went, night after day after night, tireless, searching\u2026 for prey, for a way out, for his mother, his littermates, his pack\u2026 searching, searching, and never finding.\nBehind the trees the walls rose, piles of dead man-rock that loomed all about this speck of living wood. Speckled grey they rose, and moss-spotted, yet thick and strong and higher than any wolf could hope to leap. Cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes through the piled stones that hemmed them in. His brother would stop at every hole and bare his fangs in rage, but the ways stayed closed.\nHe had done the same the first night, and learned that it was no good. Snarls would open no paths here. Circling the walls would not push them back. Lifting a leg and marking the trees would keep no men away. The world had tightened around them, but beyond the walled wood still stood the great grey caves of man-rock. Winterfell, he remembered, the sound coming to him suddenly. Beyond its sky-tall man-cliffs the true world was calling, and he knew he must answer or die.",

      "content": "Arya\nThey traveled dawn to dusk, past woods and orchards and neatly tended fields, through small villages, crowded market towns, and stout holdfasts. Come dark, they would make camp and eat by the light of the Red Sword. The men took turns standing watch. Arya would glimpse firelight flickering through the trees from the camps of other travelers. There seemed to be more camps every night, and more traffic on the kingsroad by day.\nMorn, noon, and night they came, old folks and little children, big men and small ones, barefoot girls and women with babes at their breasts. Some drove farm wagons or bumped along in the back of ox carts. More rode: draft horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, anything that would walk or run or roll. One woman led a milk cow with a little girl on its back. Arya saw a smith pushing a wheelbarrow with his tools inside, hammers and tongs and even an anvil, and a little while later a different man with a different wheelbarrow, only inside this one were two babies in a blanket. Most came on foot, with their goods on their shoulders and weary, wary looks upon their faces. They walked south, toward the city, toward King\u2019s Landing, and only one in a hundred spared so much as a word for Yoren and his charges, traveling north. She wondered why no one else was going the same way as them.\nMany of the travelers were armed; Arya saw daggers and dirks, scythes and axes, and here and there a sword. Some had made clubs from tree limbs, or carved knobby staffs. They fingered their weapons and gave lingering looks at the wagons as they rolled by, yet in the end they let the column pass. Thirty was too many, no matter what they had in those wagons.\nLook with your eyes, Syrio had said, listen with your ears.\nOne day a madwoman began to scream at them from the side of the road. \u201cFools! They\u2019ll kill you, fools!\u201d She was scarecrow thin, with hollow eyes and bloody feet.\nThe next morning, a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by Yoren and offered to buy his wagons and everything in them for a quarter of their worth. \u201cIt\u2019s war, they\u2019ll take what they want, you\u2019ll do better selling to me, my friend.\u201d Yoren turned away with a twist of his crooked shoulders, and spat.\nArya noticed the first grave that same day; a small mound beside the road, dug for a child. A crystal had been set in the soft earth, and Lommy wanted to take it until the Bull told him he\u2019d better leave the dead alone. A few leagues farther on, Praed pointed out more graves, a whole row freshly dug. After that, a day hardly passed without one.\nOne time Arya woke in the dark, frightened for no reason she could name. Above, the Red Sword shared the sky with half a thousand stars. The night seemed oddly quiet to her, though she could hear Yoren\u2019s muttered snores, the crackle of the fire, even the muffled stirrings of the donkeys. Yet somehow it felt as though the world were holding its breath, and the silence made her shiver. She went back to sleep clutching Needle.\nCome morning, when Praed did not awaken, Arya realized that it had been his coughing she had missed. They dug a grave of their own then, burying the sellsword where he\u2019d slept. Yoren stripped him of his valuables before they threw the dirt on him. One man claimed his boots, another his dagger. His mail shirt and helm were parceled out. His longsword Yoren handed to the Bull. \u201cArms like yours, might be you can learn to use this,\u201d he told him. A boy called Tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of Praed\u2019s body, so an oak might grow to mark his place.\nThat evening they stopped in a village at an ivy-covered inn. Yoren counted the coins in his purse and decided they had enough for a hot meal. \u201cWe\u2019ll sleep outside, same as ever, but they got a bathhouse here, if any of you feels the need o\u2019 hot water and a lick o\u2019 soap.\u201d\nArya did not dare, even though she smelled as bad as Yoren by now, all sour and stinky. Some of the creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from Flea Bottom with her; it didn\u2019t seem right to drown them. Tarber and Hot Pie and the Bull joined the line of men headed for the tubs. Others settled down in front of the bathhouse. The rest crowded into the common room. Yoren even sent Lommy out with tankards for the three in fetters, who\u2019d been left chained up in the back of their wagon.\nWashed and unwashed alike supped on hot pork pies and baked apples. The innkeeper gave them a round of beer on the house. \u201cI had a brother took the black, years ago. Serving boy, clever, but one day he got seen filching pepper from m\u2019lord\u2019s table. He liked the taste of it, is all. just a pinch o\u2019 pepper, but Ser Malcolm was a hard man. You get pepper on the Wall?\u201d When Yoren shook his head, the man sighed. \u201cShame. Lync loved that pepper.\u201d\nArya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough. it made her sad to think of Sansa and her father.\nThe inn was full of people moving south, and the common room erupted in scorn when Yoren said they were traveling the other way. \u201cYou\u2019ll be back soon enough,\u201d the innkeeper vowed. \u201cThere\u2019s no going north. Half the fields are burnt, and what folks are left are walled up inside their holdfasts. One bunch rides off at dawn and another one shows up by dusk.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to us,\u201d Yoren insisted stubbornly. \u201cTully or Lannister, makes no matter. The Watch takes no part.\u201d\nLord Tully is my grandfather, Arya thought. It mattered to her, but she chewed her lip and kept quiet, listening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than Lannister and Tully,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cThere\u2019s wild men down from the Mountains of the Moon, try telling them you take no part. And the Starks are in it too, the young lord\u2019s come down, the dead Hand\u2019s son\u2026\u201d\nArya sat up straight, straining to hear. Did he mean Robb?\n\u201cI heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf,\u201d said a yellow-haired man with a tankard in his hand.\n\u201cFool\u2019s talk.\u201d Yoren spat.\n\u201cThe man I heard it from, he saw it himself. A wolf big as a horse, he swore.\u201d\n\u201cSwearing don\u2019t make it true, Hod,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cYou keep swearing you\u2019ll pay what you owe me, and I\u2019ve yet to see a copper.\u201d The common room erupted in laughter, and the man with the yellow hair turned red.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year for wolves,\u201d volunteered a sallow man in a travel-stained green cloak. \u201cAround the Gods Eye, the packs have grown bolder\u2019n anyone can remember. Sheep, cows, dogs, makes no matter, they kill as they like, and they got no fear of men. It\u2019s worth your life to go into those woods by night.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s more tales, and no more true than the other.\u201d\n\u201cI heard the same thing from my cousin, and she\u2019s not the sort to lie,\u201d an old woman said. \u201cShe says there\u2019s this great pack, hundreds of them, mankillers. The one that leads them is a she-wolf, a bitch from the seventh hell.\u201d\nA she-wolf. Arya sloshed her beer, wondering. Was the Gods Eye near the Trident? She wished she had a map. It had been near the Trident that she\u2019d left Nymeria. She hadn\u2019t wanted to, but Jory said they had no choice, that if the wolf came back with them she\u2019d be killed for biting Joffrey, even though he\u2019d deserved it. They\u2019d had to shout and scream and throw stones, and it wasn\u2019t until a few of Arya\u2019s stones struck home that the direwolf had finally stopped following them. She probably wouldn\u2019t even know me now, Arya thought. Or if she did, she\u2019d hate me.\nThe man in the green cloak said, \u201cI heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one day\u2026 a market day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from his mother\u2019s arms. When the tale reached Lord Mooton, him and his sons swore they\u2019d put an end to her. They tracked her to her lair with a pack of wolfhounds, and barely escaped with their skins. Not one of those dogs came back, not one.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a story,\u201d Arya blurted out before she could stop herself. \u201cWolves don\u2019t eat babies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would you know about it, lad?\u201d asked the man in the green cloak.\nBefore she could think of an answer, Yoren had her by the arm. \u201cThe boy\u2019s greensick on beer, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not. They don\u2019t eat babies\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOutside, boy\u2026 and see that you stay there until you learn to shut your mouth when men are talking.\u201d He gave her a stiff shove, toward the side door that led back to the stables. \u201cGo on now. See that the stableboy has watered our horses.\u201d\nArya went outside, stiff with fury. \u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d she muttered, kicking at a rock as she stalked off. It went rolling and fetched up under the wagons.\n\u201cBoy,\u201d a friendly voice called out. \u201cLovely boy.\u201d\nOne of the men in irons was talking to her. Warily, Arya approached the wagon, one hand on Needle\u2019s hilt.\nThe prisoner lifted an empty tankard, his chains rattling. \u201cA man could use another taste of beer. A man has a thirst, wearing these heavy bracelets.\u201d He was the youngest of the three, slender, fine-featured, always smiling. His hair was red on one side and white on the other, all matted and filthy from cage and travel. \u201cA man could use a bath too,\u201d he said, when he saw the way Arya was looking at him. \u201cA boy could make a friend.\u201d\n\u201cI have friends,\u201d Arya said.\n\u201cNone I can see,\u201d said the one without a nose. He was squat and thick, with huge hands. Black hair covered his arms and legs and chest, even his back. He reminded Arya of a drawing she had once seen in a book, of an ape from the Summer Isles. The hole in his face made it hard to look at him for long.\nThe bald one opened his mouth and hissed like some immense white lizard. When Arya flinched back, startled, he opened his mouth wide and waggled his tongue at her, only it was more a stump than a tongue. \u201cStop that,\u201d she blurted.\n\u201cA man does not choose his companions in the black cells,\u201d the handsome one with the red-and-white hair said. Something about the way he talked reminded her of Syrio; it was the same, yet different too. \u201cThese two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. You are called Arry, is that not so?\u201d\n\u201cLumpyhead,\u201d said the noseless one. \u201cLumpyhead Lumpyface Stickboy. Have a care, Lorath, he\u2019ll hit you with his stick.\u201d\n\u201cA man must be ashamed of the company he keeps, Arry,\u201d the handsome one said. \u201cThis man has the honor to be Jaqen H\u2019ghar, once of the Free City of Lorath. Would that he were home. This man\u2019s ill-bred companions in captivity are named Rorge\u201d\u2014he waved his tankard at the noseless man\u2014\u201cand Biter.\u201d Biter hissed at her again, displaying a mouthful of yellowed teeth filed into points. \u201cA man must have some name, is that not so? Biter cannot speak and Biter cannot write, yet his teeth are very sharp, so a man calls him Biter and he smiles. Are you charmed?\u201d\nArya backed away from the wagon. \u201cNo.\u201d They can\u2019t hurt me, she told herself, they\u2019re all chained up.\nHe turned his tankard upside down. \u201cA man must weep.\u201d\nRorge, the noseless one, flung his drinking cup at her with a curse. His manacles made him clumsy, yet even so he would have sent the heavy pewter tankard crashing into her head if Arya hadn\u2019t leapt aside. \u201cYou get us some beer, pimple. Now!\u201d\n\u201cYou shut your mouth!\u201d Arya tried to think what Syrio would have done. She drew her wooden practice sword.\n\u201cCome closer,\u201d Rorge said, \u201cand I\u2019ll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.\u201d\nFear cuts deeper than swords. Arya made herself approach the wagon. Every step was harder than the one before. Fierce as a wolverine, calm as still water. The words sang in her head. Syrio would not have been afraid. She was almost close enough to touch the wheel when Biter lurched to his feet and grabbed for her, his irons clanking and rattling. The manacles brought his hands up short, half a foot from her face. He hissed.\nShe hit him. Hard, right between his little eyes.\nScreaming, Biter reeled back, and then threw all his weight against his chains. The links slithered and turned and grew taut, and Arya heard the creak of old dry wood as the great iron rings strained against the floorboards of the wagon. Huge pale hands groped for her while veins bulged along Biter\u2019s arms, but the bonds held, and finally the man collapsed backward. Blood ran from the weeping sores on his cheeks.\n\u201cA boy has more courage than sense,\u201d the one who had named himself Jaqen H\u2019ghar observed.\nArya edged backward away from the wagon. When she felt the hand on her shoulder, she whirled, bringing up her stick sword again, but it was only the Bull. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nHe raised his hands defensively. \u201cYoren said none of us should go near those three.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t scare me,\u201d Arya said.\n\u201cThen you\u2019re stupid. They scare me.\u201d The Bull\u2019s hand fell to the hilt of his sword, and Rorge began to laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s get away from them.\u201d\nArya scuffed at the ground with her foot, but she let the Bull lead her around to the front of the inn. Rorge\u2019s laughter and Biter\u2019s hissing followed them. \u201cWant to fight?\u201d she asked the Bull. She wanted to hit something.\nHe blinked at her, startled. Strands of thick black hair, still wet from the bathhouse, fell across his deep blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019d hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cYou would not.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how strong I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how quick I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it, Arry.\u201d He drew Praed\u2019s longsword. \u201cThis is cheap steel, but it\u2019s a real sword.\u201d\nArya unsheathed Needle. \u201cThis is good steel, so it\u2019s realer than yours.\u201d\nThe Bull shook his head. \u201cPromise not to cry if I cut you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll promise if you will.\u201d She turned sideways, into her water dancer\u2019s stance, but the Bull did not move. He was looking at something behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cGold cloaks.\u201d His face closed up tight.\nIt couldn\u2019t be, Arya thought, but when she glanced back, they were riding up the kingsroad, six in the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. One was an officer; he wore a black enamel breastplate ornamented with four golden disks. They drew up in front of the inn. Look with your eyes, Syrio\u2019s voice seemed to whisper. Her eyes saw white lather under their saddles; the horses had been ridden long and hard. Calm as still water, she took the Bull by the arm and drew him back behind a tall flowering hedge.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat are you doing? Let go.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet as a shadow,\u201d she whispered, pulling him down.\nSome of Yoren\u2019s other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse, waiting their turn at a tub. \u201cYou men,\u201d one of the gold cloaks shouted. \u201cYou the ones left to take the black?\u201d\n\u201cWe might be,\u201d came the cautious answer.\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather join you boys,\u201d old Reysen said. \u201cWe hear it\u2019s cold on that Wall.\u201d\nThe gold cloak officer dismounted. \u201cI have a warrant for a certain boy\u2014\u201d\nYoren stepped out of the inn, fingering his tangled black beard. \u201cWho is it wants this boy?\u201d\nThe other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside their horses. \u201cWhy are we hiding?\u201d the Bull whispered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s me they want,\u201d Arya whispered back. His ear smelled of soap. \u201cYou be quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen wants him, old man, not that it\u2019s your concern,\u201d the officer said, drawing a ribbon from his belt. \u201cHere, Her Grace\u2019s seal and warrant.\u201d\nBehind the hedge, the Bull shook his head doubtfully. \u201cWhy would the queen want you, Arry?\u201d\nShe punched his shoulder. \u201cBe quiet!\u201d\nYoren fingered the warrant ribbon with its blob of golden wax. \u201cPretty.\u201d He spit. \u201cThing is, the boy\u2019s in the Night\u2019s Watch now. What he done back in the city don\u2019t mean piss-all.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen\u2019s not interested in your views, old man, and neither am I,\u201d the officer said. \u201cI\u2019ll have the boy.\u201d\nArya thought about running, but she knew she wouldn\u2019t get far on her donkey when the gold cloaks had horses. And she was so tired of running. She\u2019d run when Ser Meryn came for her, and again when they killed her father. If she was a real water dancer, she would go out there with Needle and kill all of them, and never run from anyone ever again.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have no one,\u201d Yoren said stubbornly. \u201cThere\u2019s laws on such things.\u201d\nThe gold cloak drew a shortsword. \u201cHere\u2019s your law.\u201d\nYoren looked at the blade. \u201cThat\u2019s no law, just a sword. Happens I got one too.\u201d\nThe officer smiled. \u201cOld fool. I have five men with me.\u201d\nYoren spat. \u201cHappens I got thirty.\u201d\nThe gold cloak laughed. \u201cThis lot?\u201d said a big lout with a broken nose. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d he shouted, showing his steel.\nTarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I am,\u201d called Cutjack, the plump stonemason, pulling his hammer off the leather apron he always wore.\n\u201cMe.\u201d Kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand.\n\u201cMe and him.\u201d Koss strung his longbow.\n\u201cAll of us,\u201d said Reysen, snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried.\nDobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle, saw what was happening, and dropped everything but his dagger. \u201cIs it a fight?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said Hot Pie, scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw. Arya could not believe what she was seeing. She hated Hot Pie! Why would he risk himself for her?\nThe one with the broken nose still thought it was funny. \u201cYou girls put away them rocks and sticks before you get spanked. None of you knows what end of a sword to hold.\u201d\n\u201cI do!\u201d Arya wouldn\u2019t let them die for her like Syrio. She wouldn\u2019t! Shoving through the hedge with Needle in hand, she slid into a water dancer\u2019s stance.\nBroken Nose guffawed. The officer looked her up and down. \u201cPut the blade away, little girl, no one wants to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a girl!\u201d she yelled, furious. What was wrong with them? They rode all this way for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her. \u201cI\u2019m the one you want.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one we want.\u201d The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull, who\u2019d come forward to stand beside her, Praed\u2019s cheap steel in his hand.\nBut it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, even for an instant. Quick as that, the black brother\u2019s sword was pressed to the apple of the officer\u2019s throat. \u201cNeither\u2019s the one you get, less you want me to see if your apple\u2019s ripe yet. I got me ten, fifteen more brothers in that inn, if you still need convincing. I was you, I\u2019d let loose of that gutcutter, spread my cheeks over that fat little horse, and gallop on back to the city.\u201d He spat, and poked harder with the point of his sword. \u201cNow.\u201d\nThe officer\u2019s fingers uncurled. His sword fell in the dust.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just keep that,\u201d Yoren said. \u201cGood steel\u2019s always needed on the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. For now. Men.\u201d The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up. \u201cYou\u2019d best scamper up to that Wall of yours in a hurry, old man. The next time I catch you, I believe I\u2019ll have your head to go with the bastard boy\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cBetter men than you have tried.\u201d Yoren slapped the rump of the officer\u2019s horse with the flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad. His men followed.\nWhen they were out of sight, Hot Pie began to whoop, but Yoren looked angrier than ever. \u201cFool! You think he\u2019s done with us? Next time he won\u2019t prance up and hand me no damn ribbon. Get the rest out o\u2019 them baths, we need to be moving. Ride all night, maybe we can stay ahead o\u2019 them for a bit.\u201d He scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped. \u201cWho wants this?\u201d\n\u201cMe!\u201d Hot Pie yelled.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be using it on Arry.\u201d He handed the boy the sword, hilt first, and walked over to Arya, but it was the Bull he spoke to. \u201cQueen wants you bad, boy.\u201d\nArya was lost. \u201cWhy should she want him?\u201d\nThe Bull scowled at her. \u201cWhy should she want you? You\u2019re nothing but a little gutter rat!\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re nothing but a bastard boy!\u201d Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your true name?\u201d\n\u201cGendry,\u201d he said, like he wasn\u2019t quite sure.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why no one wants neither o\u2019 you,\u201d Yoren said, \u201cbut they can\u2019t have you regardless. You ride them two coursers. First sight of a gold cloak, make for the Wall like a dragon\u2019s on your tail. The rest o\u2019 us don\u2019t mean spit to them.\u201d\n\u201cExcept for you,\u201d Arya pointed out. \u201cThat man said he\u2019d take your head too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, as to that,\u201d Yoren said, \u201cif he can get it off my shoulders, he\u2019s welcome to it.\u201d",

      "content": "Jon\n\u201cSam?\u201d Jon called softly.\nThe air smelled of paper and dust and years. Before him, tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness, crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls. A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp. Jon blew out the taper he carried, preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper. Instead he followed the light, wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings. All in black, he was a shadow among shadows, dark of hair, long of face, grey of eye. Black moleskin gloves covered his hands; the right because it was burned, the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove.\nSamwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall. The glow came from the lamp hung over his head. He looked up at the sound of Jon\u2019s steps.\n\u201cHave you been here all night?\u201d\n\u201cHave I?\u201d Sam looked startled.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t break your fast with us, and your bed hadn\u2019t been slept in.\u201d Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted, but Jon never believed it. Desertion required its own sort of courage, and Sam had little enough of that.\n\u201cIs it morning? Down here there\u2019s no way to know.\u201d\n\u201cSam, you\u2019re a sweet fool,\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss that bed when we\u2019re sleeping on the cold hard ground, I promise you.\u201d\nSam yawned. \u201cMaester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander. I never thought\u2026 Jon, the books, have you ever seen their like? There are thousands!\u201d\nHe gazed about him. \u201cThe library at Winterfell has more than a hundred. Did you find the maps?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Sam\u2019s hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him. \u201cA dozen, at the least.\u201d He unfolded a square of parchment. \u201cThe paint has faded, but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages, and there\u2019s another book\u2026 where is it now? I was reading it a moment ago.\u201d He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather. \u201cThis,\u201d he said reverently, \u201cis the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore, written by a ranger named Redwyn. It\u2019s not dated, but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North, so it must be from before the Conquest. Jon, they fought giants! Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, it\u2019s all here.\u201d Ever so delicately, he turned pages with a finger. \u201cHe drew maps as well, see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you could write an account of our ranging, Sam.\u201d\nHe\u2019d meant to sound encouraging, but it was the wrong thing to say. The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow. He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly. \u201cThere\u2019s more maps. If I had time to search\u2026 everything\u2019s a jumble. I could set it all to order, though; I know I could, but it would take time\u2026 well, years, in truth.\u201d\n\u201cMormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that.\u201d Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, blew off the worst of the dust. A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it. \u201cLook, this one is crumbling,\u201d he said, frowning over the faded script.\n\u201cBe gentle.\u201d Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a wounded animal. \u201cThe important books used to be copied over when they needed them. Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.\u201d\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t bother copying that one. Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars of fish oil, a cask of salt\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAn inventory,\u201d Sam said, \u201cor perhaps a bill of sale.\u201d\n\u201cWho cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago?\u201d Jon wondered.\n\u201cI would.\u201d Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it. \u201cYou can learn so much from ledgers like that, truly you can. it can tell you how many men were in the Night\u2019s Watch then, how they lived, what they ate\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey ate food,\u201d said Jon, \u201cand they lived as we live.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. This vault is a treasure, Jon.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Jon was doubtful. Treasure meant gold, silver, and jewels, not dust, spiders, and rotting leather.\n\u201cI do,\u201d the fat boy blurted. He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy. \u201cI found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest\u2026 works that even the Citadel doesn\u2019t have, scrolls from old Valyria, counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe books will still be here when we return.\u201d\n\u201cIf we return\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers. Qhorin Halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower. You\u2019ll be as safe as if you were back in your lord father\u2019s castle at Horn Hill.\u201d\nSamwell Tarly managed a sad little smile. \u201cI was never very safe in my father\u2019s castle either.\u201d\nThe gods play cruel jests, Jon thought. Pyp and Toad, all a lather to be a part of the great ranging, were to remain at Castle Black. It was Samwell Tarly, the self-proclaimed coward, grossly fat, timid, and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword, who must face the haunted forest. The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens, so they might send back word as they went. Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them, so his steward must go in his place. \u201cWe need you for the ravens, Sam. And someone has to help me keep Grenn humble.\u201d\nSam\u2019s chins quivered. \u201cYou could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone,\u201d he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice. \u201cI could show you how. You know your letters too, you could write down Lord Mormont\u2019s messages as well as I.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the Old Bear\u2019s steward. I\u2019ll need to squire for him, tend his horse, set up his tent; I won\u2019t have time to watch over birds as well. Sam, you said the words. You\u2019re a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch now.\u201d\n\u201cA brother of the Night\u2019s Watch shouldn\u2019t be so scared.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all scared. We\u2019d be fools if we weren\u2019t.\u201d Too many rangers had been lost the past two years, even Benjen Stark, Jon\u2019s uncle. They had found two of his uncle\u2019s men in the wood, slain, but the corpses had risen in the chill of night. Jon\u2019s burnt fingers twitched as he remembered. He still saw the wight in his dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it. Come, I\u2019ll help you gather up the maps.\u201d\nSam nodded unhappily. The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left. The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks, winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the earth. In summer the wormwalks were seldom used, save by rats and other vermin, but winter was a different matter. When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north, the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together.\nSoon, Jon thought as they climbed. He\u2019d seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with word of summer\u2019s end, the great raven of the Citadel, white and silent as Ghost. He had seen a winter once, when he was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a short one, and mild. This one would be different. He could feel it in his bones.\nThe steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith\u2019s bellows by the time they reached the surface. They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon\u2019s cloak swirl and snap. Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them.\nSam squinted up at the Wall. It loomed above them, an icy cliff seven hundred feet high. Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of its own. The color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light. Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, now the dirty white of old snow, and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone. The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance. It was the end of the world.\nAnd we are going beyond it.\nThe morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds, but the pale red line was there behind them. The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont\u2019s Torch, saying (only half in jest) that the gods must have sent it to light the old man\u2019s way through the haunted forest.\n\u201cThe comet\u2019s so bright you can see it by day now,\u201d Sam said, shading his eyes with a fistful of books.\n\u201cNever mind about comets, it\u2019s maps the Old Bear wants.\u201d\nGhost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole\u2019s Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind. Grenn had gone with them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging. They\u2019d wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it. \u201cDo what you want,\u201d he told Toad, \u201cI took a vow.\u201d\nAs they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song. Some men want whores on the eve of battle, and some want gods. Jon wondered who felt better afterward. The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches. The Seven have no power beyond the Wall, he thought, but my gods will be waiting.\nOutside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits. They\u2019d come in last night with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall. This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior. Ser Endrew was showing him the error of that presumption. He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been, but his lessons would still raise bruises. Sam winced at every blow, but Jon Snow watched the swordplay closely.\n\u201cWhat do you make of them, Snow?\u201d Donal Noye stood in the door of his armory, bare-chested under a leather apron, the stump of his left arm uncovered for once. With his big gut and barrel chest, his flat nose and bristly black jaw, Noyc did not make a pretty sight, but he was a welcome one nonetheless. The armorer had proved himself a good friend.\n\u201cThey smell of summer,\u201d Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling. \u201cWhere did Conwy find them?\u201d\n\u201cA lord\u2019s dungeon near Gulltown,\u201d the smith replied. \u201cA brigand, a barber, a beggar, two orphans, and a boy whore. With such do we defend the realms of men.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do.\u201d Jon gave Sam a private smile. \u201cWe did.\u201d\nNoye drew him closer. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard these tidings of your brother?\u201d\n\u201cLast night.\u201d Conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them, and the talk in the common room had been of little else. Jon was still not certain how he felt about it. Robb a king? The brother he\u2019d played with, fought with, shared his first cup of wine with? But not mother\u2019s milk, no. So now Robb will sip summerwine from jeweled goblets, while I\u2019m kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from cupped hands. \u201cRobb will make a good king,\u201d he said loyally.\n\u201cWill he now?\u201d The smith eyed him frankly. \u201cI hope that\u2019s so, boy, but once I might have said the same of Robert.\u201d\n\u201cThey say you forged his warhammer,\u201d Jon remembered.\n\u201cAye. I was his man, a Baratheon man, smith and armorer at Storm\u2019s End until I lost the arm. I\u2019m old enough to remember Lord Steffon before the sea took him, and I knew those three sons of his since they got their names. I tell you this\u2014Robert was never the same after he put on that crown. Some men are like swords, made for fighting. Hang them up and they go to rust.\u201d\n\u201cAnd his brothers?\u201d Jon asked.\nThe armorer considered that a moment. \u201cRobert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He\u2019ll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he\u2019s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.\u201d\nAnd what metal is Robb? Jon did not ask. Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor. Among the brotherhood of the Night\u2019s Watch, there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters. Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore\u2026 as Jon himself had good reason to know. Even Sam\u2014his father\u2019s House was sworn to Highgarden, whose Lord Tyrell supported King Renly. Best not to talk of such things. The Night\u2019s Watch took no sides. \u201cLord Mormont awaits us,\u201d Jon said.\n\u201cI won\u2019t keep you from the Old Bear.\u201d Noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled. \u201cMay the gods go with you on the morrow, Snow. You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?\u201d\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Jon promised him.\nLord Commander Mormont had taken up residence in the King\u2019s Tower after the fire had gutted his own. Jon left Ghost with the guards outside the door. \u201cMore stairs,\u201d said Sam miserably as they started up. \u201cI hate stairs.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s one thing we won\u2019t face in the wood.\u201d\nWhen they entered the solar, the raven spied them at once. \u201cSnow!\u201d the bird shrieked. Mormont broke off his conversation. \u201cTook you long enough with those maps.\u201d He pushed the remains of breakfast out of the way to make room on the table. \u201cPut them here. I\u2019ll have a look at them later.\u201d\nThoren Smallwood, a sinewy ranger with a weak chin and a weaker mouth hidden under a thin scraggle of beard, gave Jon and Sam a cool look. He had been one of Alliser Thorne\u2019s henchmen, and had no love for either of them. \u201cThe Lord Commander\u2019s place is at Castle Black, lording and commanding,\u201d he told Mormont, ignoring the newcomers, \u201cit seems to me.\u201d\nThe raven flapped big black wings. \u201cMe, me, me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are ever Lord Commander, you may do as you please,\u201d Mormont told the ranger, \u201cbut it seems to me that I have not died yet, nor have the brothers put you in my place.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m First Ranger now, with Ben Stark lost and Ser Jaremy killed,\u201d Smallwood said stubbornly. \u201cThe command should be mine.\u201d\nMormont would have none of it. \u201cI sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Waymar before him. I do not mean to send you after them and sit wondering how long I must wait before I give you up for lost as well.\u201d He pointed. \u201cAnd Stark remains First Ranger until we know for a certainty that he is dead. Should that day come, it will be me who names his successor, not you. Now stop wasting my time. We ride at first light, or have you forgotten?\u201d\nSmallwood pushed to his feet. \u201cAs my lord commands.\u201d On the way out, he frowned at Jon, as if it were somehow his fault.\n\u201cFirst Ranger!\u201d The Old Bear\u2019s eyes lighted on Sam. \u201cI\u2019d sooner name you First Ranger. He has the effrontery to tell me to my face that I\u2019m too old to ride with him. Do I look old to you, boy?\u201d The hair that had retreated from Mormont\u2019s spotted scalp had regrouped beneath his chin in a shaggy grey beard that covered much of his chest. He thumped it hard. \u201cDo I look frail?\u201d\nSam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak. The Old Bear terrified him. \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d Jon offered quickly. \u201cYou look strong as a\u2026 a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t cozen me, Snow, you know I won\u2019t have it. Let me have a look at these maps.\u201d Mormont pawed through them brusquely, giving each no more than a glance and a grunt. \u201cWas this all you could find?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 m-m-my lord,\u201d Sam stammered, \u201cthere\u2026 there were more, b-b-but\u2026 the dis-disorder\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThese are old,\u201d Mormont complained, and his raven echoed him with a sharp cry of \u201cOld, old.\u201d\n\u201cThe villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places,\u201d Jon pointed out.\n\u201cTrue enough. Have you chosen your ravens yet, Tarly?\u201d\n\u201cM-m-maester Aemon m-means to p-pick them come evenfall, after the f-f-feeding.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have his best. Smart birds, and strong.\u201d\n\u201cStrong,\u201d his own bird said, preening. \u201cStrong, strong.\u201d\n\u201cIf it happens that we\u2019re all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we died.\u201d\nTalk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness. Mormont leaned forward. \u201cTarly, when I was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat. If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, beware of weasels.\u201d He waved a brusque dismissal. \u201cOff with you, I\u2019m too busy for folly. No doubt the maester has some work you can do.\u201d\nSam swallowed, stepped back, and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the rushes.\n\u201cIs that boy as big a fool as he seems?\u201d the Lord Commander asked when he\u2019d gone. \u201cFool,\u201d the raven complained. Mormont did not wait for Jon to answer. \u201cHis lord father stands high in King Renly\u2019s councils, and I had half a notion to dispatch him\u2026 no, best not. Renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy. I\u2019ll send Ser Arnell. He\u2019s a deal steadier, and his mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways.\u201d\n\u201cIf it please my lord, what would you have of King Renly?\u201d\n\u201cThe same things I\u2019d have of all of them, lad. Men, horses, swords, armor, grain, cheese, wine, wool, nails\u2026 the Night\u2019s Watch is not proud, we take what is offered.\u201d His fingers drummed against the roughhewn planks of the table. \u201cIf the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser should reach King\u2019s Landing by the turn of the moon, but whether this boy Joffrey will pay him any heed, I do not know. House Lannister has never been a friend to the Watch.\u201d\n\u201cThorne has the wight\u2019s hand to show them.\u201d A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it was, that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive.\n\u201cWould that we had another hand to send to Renly.\u201d\n\u201cDywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cAye, Dywen says. And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall.\u201d Mormont snorted. \u201cMy sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover. I\u2019d believe that before I\u2019d believe one fifteen feet tall. Though in a world where dead come walking\u2026 ah, even so, a man must believe his eyes. I have seen the dead walk. I\u2019ve not seen any giant bears.\u201d He gave Jon a long, searching look. \u201cBut we were speaking of hands. How is yours?\u201d\n\u201cBetter.\u201d Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him. Scars covered his arm halfway to the elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but it was healing. \u201cIt itches, though. Maester Aemon says that\u2019s good. He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride.\u201d\n\u201cYou can wield Longclaw despite the pain?\u201d\n\u201cWell enough.\u201d Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him. \u201cI\u2019m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said.\u201d\n\u201cBlind he may be, but Aemon knows what he\u2019s about. I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years. Do you know that he might have been king?\u201d\nJon was taken by surprise. \u201cHe told me his father was king, but not\u2026 I thought him perhaps a younger son.\u201d\n\u201cSo he was. His father\u2019s father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His Name, who brought Dorne into the realm. Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess. She gave him four sons. Aemon\u2019s father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was his third son. Mind you, all this happened long before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make me.\u201d\n\u201cMaester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight.\u201d\n\u201cSo he was. Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron\u2019s true father, not Aegon the Unworthy. Be that as it may, our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight\u2019s martial nature. He likes to say he had a slow sword but quick wits. Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the Citadel. He was nine or ten, I believe\u2026 and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well.\u201d\nMaester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew. Frail, shrunken, wizened, and blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya.\nMormont continued. \u201cAemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness. King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daeron\u2019s second son, Aerys.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mad King?\u201d Jon was confused. Aerys had been king before Robert, that wasn\u2019t so long ago.\n\u201cNo, this was Aerys the First. The one Robert deposed was the second of that name.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d\n\u201cEighty years or close enough,\u201d the Old Bear said, \u201cand no, I still hadn\u2019t been born, though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester\u2019s chain by then. Aerys wed his own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling\u2019s court\u2026 until his royal uncle died without issue. The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron\u2019s four sons. That was Maekar, Aemon\u2019s father. The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another Daeron. Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir. Some pox he caught from a whore, I believe. The next brother was Aerion.\u201d\n\u201cAerion the Monstrous?\u201d Jon knew that name. \u201cThe Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon\u201d was one of Old Nan\u2019s more gruesome tales. His little brother Bran had loved it.\n\u201cThe very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse. Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord.\u201d\nJon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own maester had seen to that. \u201cThat was the year of the Great Council,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lords passed over Prince Aerion\u2019s infant son and Prince Daeron\u2019s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon.\u201d\n\u201cYes and no. First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion\u2019s on the throne, and Daeron\u2019s girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon\u2019s younger brother\u2014Aegon, the Fifth of His Name. Aegon the Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother\u2019s rule would seek to use him, so he came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother\u2019s son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings.\u201d\n\u201cKing,\u201d croaked the raven. The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont\u2019s shoulder. \u201cKing,\u201d it said again, strutting back and forth.\n\u201cHe likes that word,\u201d Jon said, smiling.\n\u201cAn easy word to say. An easy word to like.\u201d\n\u201cKing,\u201d the bird said again.\n\u201cI think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cThe realm has three kings already, and that\u2019s two too many for my liking.\u201d Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow.\nIt made him feel odd. \u201cMy lord, why have you told me this, about Maester Aemon?\u201d\n\u201cMust I have a reason?\u201d Mormont shifted in his seat, frowning. \u201cYour brother Robb has been crowned King in the North. You and Aemon have that in common. A king for a brother.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this too,\u201d said Jon. \u201cA vow.\u201d\nThe Old Bear gave a loud snort, and the raven took flight, flapping in a circle about the room, \u201cGive me a man for every vow I\u2019ve seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell.\u201d\nMormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm. \u201cA lord\u2019s one thing, a king\u2019s another.\u201d He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket. \u201cThey will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You\u2019ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they\u2019ll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon\u2026 and I\u2019ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.\u201d\nJon drew himself up, taut as a bowstring. \u201cAnd if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am?\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Mormont asked. \u201cBastard as you are?\u201d\n\u201cBe troubled,\u201d said Jon, \u201cand keep my vows.\u201d",

      "content": "Catelyn\nHer son\u2019s crown was fresh from the forge, and it seemed to Catelyn Stark that the weight of it pressed heavy on Robb\u2019s head.\nThe ancient crown of the Kings of Winter had been lost three centuries ago, yielded up to Aegon the Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission. What Aegon had done with it no man could say. Lord Hoster\u2019s smith had done his work well, and Robb\u2019s crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords. Of gold and silver and gemstones, it had none; bronze and iron were the metals of winter, dark and strong to fight against the cold.\nAs they waited in Riverrun\u2019s Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them, she saw Robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair; moments later, he moved it forward again; later he gave it a quarter turn, as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow. It is no easy thing to wear a crown, Catelyn thought, watching, especially for a boy of fifteen years.\nWhen the guards brought in the captive, Robb called for his sword. Olyvar Frey offered it up hilt first, and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees, a threat plain for all to see. \u201cYour Grace, here is the man you asked for,\u201d announced Ser Robin Ryger, captain of the Tully household guard.\n\u201cKneel before the king, Lannister!\u201d Theon Greyjoy shouted. Ser Robin forced the prisoner to his knees.\nHe did not look a lion, Catelyn reflected. This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady Genna who was sister to Lord Tywin Lannister, but he had none of the fabled Lannister beauty, the fair hair and green eyes. Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of his sire, Ser Emmon Frey, old Lord Walder\u2019s second son. His eyes were pale and watery and he could not seem to stop blinking, but perhaps that was only the light. The cells below Riverrun were dark and damp\u2026 and these days crowded as well.\n\u201cRise, Ser Cleos.\u201d Her son\u2019s voice was not as icy as his father\u2019s would have been, but he did not sound a boy of fifteen either. War had made a man of him before his time. Morning light glimmered faintly against the edge of the steel across his knees.\nYet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious; it was the beast. Grey Wind, her son had named him. A direwolf large as any elkhound, lean and smoke-dark, with eyes like molten gold. When the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight, every man in that hall could smell the scent of fear. Ser Cleos had been taken during the battle in the Whispering Wood, where Grey Wind had ripped out the throats of half a dozen men.\nThe knight scrambled up, edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers laughed aloud. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d barked Lord Umber, the Greatjon, ever the loudest of Robb\u2019s northern bannermen\u2026 and the truest and fiercest as well, or so he insisted. He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the North, and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-made sovereign.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Ser Cleos corrected hastily. \u201cPardons.\u201d\nHe is not a bold man, this one, Catelyn thought. More of a Frey than a Lannister, in truth. His cousin the Kingslayer would have been a much different matter. They would never have gotten that honorific through Ser Jaime Lannister\u2019s perfect teeth.\n\u201cI brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in King\u2019s Landing. You\u2019ll travel under a peace banner, with thirty of my best men to escort you.\u201d\nSer Cleos was visibly relieved. \u201cThen I should be most glad to bring His Grace\u2019s message to the queen.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstand,\u201d Robb said, \u201cI am not giving you your freedom. Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged me his support and that of House Frey. Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering Wood, but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner. That makes you a Lannister, not a Frey. I want your pledge, on your honor as a knight, that after you deliver my message you\u2019ll return with the queen\u2019s reply, and resume your captivity.\u201d\nSer Cleos answered at once. \u201cI do so vow.\u201d\n\u201cEvery man in this hall has heard you,\u201d warned Catelyn\u2019s brother Ser Edmure Tully, who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father. \u201cIf you do not return, the whole realm will know you forsworn.\u201d\n\u201cI will do as I pledged,\u201d Ser Cleos replied stiffly. \u201cWhat is this message? \u201c\n\u201cAn offer of peace.\u201d Robb stood, longsword in hand. Grey Wind moved to his side. The hall grew hushed. \u201cTell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms, I will sheath this sword, and make an end to the war between us.\u201d\nIn the back of the hall, Catelyn glimpsed the tall, gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark shove through a rank of guards and out the door. No one else moved. Robb paid the disruption no mind. \u201cOlyvar, the paper,\u201d he commanded. The squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment.\nRobb unrolled it. \u201cFirst, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King\u2019s Landing to White Harbor. It is to be understood that Sansa\u2019s betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon is at an end. When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell, I will release the queen\u2019s cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey, and give them safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered.\u201d\nCatelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face, each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips.\n\u201cSecondly, my lord father\u2019s bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King\u2019s Landing must also be returned.\u201d\nLiving men had gone south, and cold bones would return. Ned had the truth of it, she thought. His place was at Winterfell, he said as much, but would I hear him? No. Go, I told him, you must be Robert\u2019s Hand, for the good of our House, for the sake of our children\u2026 my doing, mine, no other\u2026\n\u201cThird, my father\u2019s greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.\u201d\nShe watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt, his face as still as stone.\n\u201cFourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident. Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for his father\u2019s good behavior.\u201d\nShe studied Theon Greyjoy\u2019s sly smile, wondering what it meant. That young man had a way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to; Catelyn had never liked it.\n\u201cLastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north. Henceforth we are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east.\u201d\n\u201cTHE KING IN THE NORTH!\u201d boomed Greatjon Umber, a ham-sized fist hammering at the air as he shouted. \u201cStark! Stark! The King in the North!\u201d\nRobb rolled up the parchment again. \u201cMaester Vyman has drawn a map, showing the borders we claim. You shall have a copy for the queen. Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond these borders, and cease his raiding, burning, and pillage. The Queen Regent and her son shall make no claims to taxes, incomes, nor service from my people, and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty, vows, pledges, debts, and obligations owed to the Iron Throne and the Houses Baratheon and Lannister. Additionally, the Lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages, to be mutually agreed upon, as a pledge of peace. These I will treat as honored guests, according to their station. So long as the terms of this pact are abided with faithfully, I shall release two hostages every year, and return them safely to their families.\u201d Robb tossed the rolled parchment at the knight\u2019s feet. \u201cThere are the terms. If she meets them, I\u2019ll give her peace. if not\u201d\u2014he whistled, and Grey Wind moved forward snarling\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll give her another Whispering Wood.\u201d\n\u201cStark!\u201d the Greatjon roared again, and now other voices took up the cry. \u201cStark, Stark, King in the North!\u201d The direwolf threw back his head and howled.\nSer Cleos had gone the color of curdled milk. \u201cThe queen shall hear your message, my\u2014Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Robb said. \u201cSer Robin, see that he has a good meal and clean clothing. He\u2019s to ride at first light.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, Your Grace,\u201d Ser Robin Ryger replied.\n\u201cThen we are done.\u201d The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as Robb turned to leave, Grey Wind at his heels. Olyvar Frey scrambled ahead to open the door. Catelyn followed them out, her brother at her side.\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall, \u201cthough that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king.\u201d\nRobb scratched Grey Wind behind the ear. \u201cDid you see the look on his face, Mother?\u201d he asked, smiling.\n\u201cWhat I saw was Lord Karstark, walking out.\u201d\n\u201cAs did I.\u201d Robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to Olyvar. \u201cTake this thing back to my bedchamber.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Grace.\u201d The squire hurried off.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark,\u201d her brother Edmure declared. \u201cHow can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father\u2019s domains, stealing his crops and slaughtering his people? I say again, we ought to be marching on Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cWe lack the strength,\u201d Robb said, though unhappily.\nEdmure persisted. \u201cDo we grow stronger sitting here? Our host dwindles every day.\u201d\n\u201cAnd whose doing is that?\u201d Catelyn snapped at her brother. It had been at Edmure\u2019s insistence that Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning, each to defend his own lands. Ser Marq Piper and Lord Karyl Vance had been the first to go. Lord Jonos Bracken had followed, vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead, and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced his intent to return to his seat at Seagard, still mercifully untouched by the fighting.\n\u201cYou cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to the sword,\u201d Ser Edmure said, \u201cbut Lord Karstark is a northman. It would be an ill thing if he were to leave us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll speak with him,\u201d said Robb. \u201cHe lost two sons in the Whispering Wood. Who can blame him if he does not want to make peace with their killers\u2026 with my father\u2019s killers\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMore bloodshed will not bring your father back to us, or Lord Rickard\u2019s sons,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cAn offer had to be made\u2014though a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms.\u201d\n\u201cAny sweeter and I would have gagged.\u201d Her son\u2019s beard had grown in redder than his auburn hair. Robb seemed to think it made him look fierce, royal\u2026 older. But bearded or no, he was still a youth of fifteen, and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark. it had been no easy thing to convince him to make even this offer, poor as it was.\n\u201cCersei Lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of cousins. It\u2019s her brother she\u2019ll want, as you know full well.\u201d She had told him as much before, but Catelyn was finding that kings do not listen half so attentively as sons.\n\u201cI can\u2019t release the Kingslayer, not even if I wanted to. My lords would never abide it.\u201d\n\u201cYour lords made you their king.\u201d\n\u201cAnd can unmake me just as easy.\u201d\n\u201cIf your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly. Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in his cell. If he should die while he\u2019s your prisoner, men will say\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014that he well deserved it,\u201d Robb finished.\n\u201cAnd your sisters?\u201d Catelyn asked sharply. \u201cWill they deserve their deaths as well? I promise you, if any harm comes to her brother, Cersei will pay us back blood for blood\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLannister won\u2019t die,\u201d Robb said. \u201cNo one so much as speaks to him without my warrant. He has food, water, clean straw, more comfort than he has any right to. But I won\u2019t free him, not even for Arya and Sansa.\u201d\nHer son was looking down at her, Catelyn realized. Was it war that made him grow so fast, she wondered, or the crown they had put on his head? \u201cAre you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field again, is that the truth of it?\u201d\nGrey Wind growled, as if he sensed Robb\u2019s anger, and Edmure Tully put a brotherly hand on Catelyn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCat, don\u2019t. The boy has the right of this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me the boy,\u201d Robb said, rounding on his uncle, his anger spilling out all at once on poor Edmure, who had only meant to support him. \u201cI\u2019m almost a man grown, and a king\u2014your king, ser. And I don\u2019t fear Jaime Lannister. I defeated him once, I\u2019ll defeat him again if I must, only\u2026\u201d He pushed a fall of hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head. \u201cI might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for Father, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026but not for the girls?\u201d Her voice was icy quiet. \u201cGirls are not important enough, are they?\u201d\nRobb made no answer, but there was hurt in his eyes. Blue eyes, Tully eyes, eyes she had given him. She had wounded him, but he was too much his father\u2019s son to admit it.\nThat was unworthy of me, she told herself. Gods be good, what is to become of me? He is doing his best, trying so hard, I know it, I see it, and yet\u2026 I have lost my Ned, the rock my life was built on, I could not bear to lose the girls as well\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019ll do all I can for my sisters,\u201d Robb said. \u201cIf the queen has any sense, she\u2019ll accept my terms. If not, I\u2019ll make her rue the day she refused me.\u201d\nPlainly, he\u2019d had enough of the subject. \u201cMother, are you certain you will not consent to go to the Twins? You would be farther from the fighting, and you could acquaint yourself with Lord Frey\u2019s daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done.\u201d\nHe wants me gone, Catelyn thought wearily. Kings are not supposed to have mothers, it would seem, and I tell him things he does not want to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to decide which of Lord Walder\u2019s girls you prefer without your mother\u2019s help, Robb.\u201d\n\u201cThen go with Theon. He leaves on the morrow. He\u2019ll help the Mallisters escort that lot of captives to Seagard and then take ship for the Iron Islands. You could find a ship as well, and be back at Winterfell with a moon\u2019s turn, if the winds are kind. Bran and Rickon need you.\u201d\nAnd you do not, is that what you mean to say? \u201cMy lord father has little enough time remaining him. So long as your grandfather lives, my place is at Riverrun with him.\u201d\n\u201cI could command you to go. As king. I could.\u201d\nCatelyn ignored that. \u201cI\u2019ll say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and kept Theon close to you.\u201d\n\u201cWho better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son?\u201d\n\u201cJason Mallister,\u201d offered Catelyn. \u201cTytos Blackwood. Stevron Frey. Anyone\u2026 but not Theon.\u201d\nHer son squatted beside Grey Wind, ruffling the wolf\u2019s fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes. \u201cTheon\u2019s fought bravely for us. I told you how he saved Bran from those wildlings in the wolfswood. If the Lannisters won\u2019t make peace, I\u2019ll have need of Lord Greyjoy\u2019s longships.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a hostage half his life.\u201d\n\u201cFor good reason,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cBalon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted. He wore a crown himself, remember, if only for a season. He may aspire to wear one again.\u201d\nRobb stood. \u201cI will not grudge him that. If I\u2019m King in the North, let him be King of the Iron Islands, if that\u2019s his desire. I\u2019ll give him a crown gladly, so long as he helps us bring down the Lannisters.\u201d\n\u201cRobb\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sending Theon. Good day, Mother. Grey Wind, come.\u201d Robb walked off briskly, the direwolf padding beside him.\nCatelyn could only watch him go. Her son and now her king. How queer that felt. Command, she had told him back in Moat Cailin. And so he did. \u201cI am going to visit Father,\u201d she announced abruptly. \u201cCome with me, Edmure.\u201d\n\u201cI need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training. I\u2019ll visit him later.\u201d\nIf he still lives, Catelyn thought, but she said nothing. Her brother would sooner face battle than that sickroom.\nThe shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood, with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood. A wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees, all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past. Autumn had come, the Conclave had declared, but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet. For that Catelyn was duly grateful. Autumn was always a fearful time, with the specter of winter looming ahead. Even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last.\nHoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, lay abed in his solar, with its commanding view to the east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle. He was sleeping when Catelyn entered, his hair and beard as white as his featherbed, his once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him.\nBeside the bed, still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak, sat her father\u2019s brother, the Blackfish. His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud. \u201cDoes Robb know you are returned, Uncle?\u201d Ser Brynden Tully was Robb\u2019s eyes and ears, the commander of his scouts and outriders.\n\u201cNo. I came here straight from the stables, when they told me the king was holding court. His Grace will want to hear my tidings in private first I\u2019d think.\u201d The Blackfish was a tall, lean man, grey of hair and precise in his movements, his clean-shaven face lined and windburnt. \u201cHow is he?\u201d he asked, and she knew he did not mean Robb.\n\u201cMuch the same. The maester gives him dreamwine and milk of the poppy for his pain, so he sleeps most of the time, and eats too little. He seems weaker with each day that passes.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he speak?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026 but there is less and less sense to the things he says. He talks of his regrets, of unfinished tasks, of people long dead and times long past. Sometimes he does not know what season it is, or who I am. Once he called me by Mother\u2019s name.\u201d\n\u201cHe misses her still,\u201d Ser Brynden answered. \u201cYou have her face. I can see it in your cheekbones, and your jaw\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou remember more of her than I do. It has been a long time.\u201d She seated herself on the bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her father\u2019s face.\n\u201cEach time I ride out, I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return.\u201d Despite their quarrels, there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once disowned.\n\u201cAt least you made your peace with him.\u201d\nThey sat for a time in silence, until Catelyn raised her head. \u201cYou spoke of tidings that Robb needed to hear?\u201d Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto his side, almost as if he had heard.\nBrynden stood. \u201cCome outside. Best if we do not wake him.\u201d\nShe followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted three-sided from the solar like the prow of a ship. Her uncle glanced up, frowning. \u201cYou can see it by day now. My men call it the Red Messenger\u2026 but what is the message?\u201d\nCatelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god. \u201cThe Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it\u2019s an omen of victory for Riverrun\u2014he sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.\u201d\n\u201cThat thing\u2019s not crimson,\u201d Ser Brynden said. \u201cNor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That\u2019s blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.\u201d\n\u201cOur blood or theirs?\u201d\n\u201cWas there ever a war where only one side bled?\u201d Her uncle gave a shake of the head. \u201cThe riverlands are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye. The fighting has spread south to the Blackwater and north across the Trident, almost to the Twins. Marq Piper and Karyl Vance have won some small victories, and this southron lordling Beric Dondarrion has been raiding the raiders, falling upon Lord Tywin\u2019s foraging parties and vanishing back into the woods. It\u2019s said that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting that he\u2019d slain Dondarrion, until he led his column into one of Lord Beric\u2019s traps and got every man of them killed.\u201d\n\u201cSome of Ned\u2019s guard from King\u2019s Landing are with this Lord Beric,\u201d Catelyn recalled. \u201cMay the gods preserve them.\u201d\n\u201cDondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves, if the tales be true,\u201d her uncle said, \u201cbut your father\u2019s bannermen make a sadder tale. Robb should never have let them go. They\u2019ve scattered like quail, each man trying to protect his own, and it\u2019s folly, Cat, folly. Jonos Bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of his castle, and his nephew Hendry slain. Tytos Blackwood\u2019s swept the Lannisters off his lands, but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left him nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert. Darry men recaptured their lord\u2019s keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole garrison to the sword, even their lord.\u201d\nCatelyn was horrorstruck. \u201cDarry was only a child.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and the last of his line as well. The boy would have brought a fine ransom, but what does gold mean to a frothing dog like Gregor Clegane? That beast\u2019s head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm, I vow.\u201d\nCatelyn knew Ser Gregor\u2019s evil reputation, yet still\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me of heads, Uncle. Cersei has mounted Ned\u2019s on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep, and left it for the crows and flies.\u201d Even now, it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone. Some nights she would wake in darkness, half-asleep, and for an instant expect to find him there beside her. \u201cClegane is no more than Lord Tywin\u2019s catspaw.\u201d For Tywin Lannister\u2014Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, father to Queen Cersei, Ser Jaime the Kingslayer, and Tyrion the Imp, and grandfather to Joffrey Baratheon, the new-crowned boy king\u2014was the true danger, Catelyn believed.\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Ser Brynden admitted. \u201cAnd Tywin Lannister is no man\u2019s fool. He sits safe behind the walls of Harrenhal, feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take. Gregor is not the only dog he\u2019s loosed. Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well, and some sellsword out of Qohor who\u2019d sooner maim a man than kill him. I\u2019ve seen what they leave behind them. Whole villages put to the torch, women raped and mutilated, butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs\u2026 it would sicken even the dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Edmure hears this, he will rage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that will be just as Lord Tywin desires. Even terror has its purpose, Cat. Lannister wants to provoke us to battle.\u201d\n\u201cRobb is like to give him that wish,\u201d Catelyn said, fretful. \u201cHe is restless as a cat sitting here, and Edmure and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on.\u201d Her son had won two great victories, smashing Jaime Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing his leaderless host outside the walls of Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps, but from the way some of his bannermen spoke of him, he might have been Aegon the Conqueror reborn.\nBrynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow. \u201cMore fool they. My first rule of war, Cat\u2014never give the enemy his wish. Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing. He wants us to march on Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cHarrenhal.\u201d Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal, the vast fortress that King Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past, when the Seven Kingdoms had been seven kingdoms, and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands. In his pride, Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all Westeros. Forty years it had taken, rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake while Harren\u2019s armies plundered his neighbors for stone, lumber, gold, and workers. Thousands of captives died in his quarries, chained to his sledges, or laboring on his five colossal towers. Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer. Weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters. Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream. And when at last Harrenhal stood complete, on the very day King Harren took up residence, Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at King\u2019s Landing.\nCatelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to her own children, back at Winterfell. \u201cAnd King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons,\u201d the tale always ended. \u201cFor dragons fly.\u201d Harren and all his line had perished in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress, and every house that held Harrenhal since had come to misfortune. Strong it might be, but it was a dark place, and cursed.\n\u201cI would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep,\u201d Catelyn admitted. \u201cYet we must do something, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd soon,\u201d her uncle agreed. \u201cI have not told you the worst of it, child. The men I sent west have brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock.\u201d\nAnother Lannister army. The thought made her ill. \u201cRobb must be told at once. Who will command?\u201d\n\u201cSer Stafford Lannister, it\u2019s said.\u201d He turned to gaze out over the rivers, his red-and-blue cloak stirring in the breeze.\n\u201cAnother nephew?\u201d The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile house.\n\u201cCousin,\u201d Ser Brynden corrected. \u201cBrother to Lord Tywin\u2019s late wife, so twice related. An old man and a bit of a dullard, but he has a son, Ser Daven, who is more formidable.\u201d\n\u201cThen let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field.\u201d\n\u201cWe have some time yet before we must face them. This lot will be sellswords, freeriders, and green boys from the stews of Lannisport. Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle\u2026 and make no mistake, Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer. He will not rush in heedless. He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cUnless\u2026\u201d said Catelyn.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Ser Brynden prompted.\n\u201cUnless he must leave Harrenhal,\u201d she said, \u201cto face some other threat.\u201d\nHer uncle looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cLord Renly.\u201d\n\u201cKing Renly.\u201d If she would ask help from the man, she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself.\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll want something, though.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll want what kings always want,\u201d she said. \u201cHomage.\u201d",

      "content": "Tyrion\nJanos Slynt was a butcher\u2019s son, and he laughed like a man chopping meat. \u201cMore wine?\u201d Tyrion asked him.\n\u201cI should not object,\u201d Lord Janos said, holding out his cup. He was built like a keg, and had a similar capacity. \u201cI should not object at all. That\u2019s a fine red. From the Arbor?\u201d\n\u201cDornish.\u201d Tyrion gestured, and his serving man poured. But for the servants, he and Lord Janos were alone in the Small Hall, at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness. \u201cQuite the find. Dornish wines are not often so rich.\u201d\n\u201cRich,\u201d said the big frog-faced man, taking a healthy gulp. He was not a man for sipping, Janos Slynt. Tyrion had made note of that at once. \u201cYes, rich, that\u2019s the very word I was searching for, the very word. You have a gift for words, Lord Tyrion, if I might say so. And you tell a droll tale. Droll, yes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased you think so\u2026 but I\u2019m not a lord, as you are. A simple Tyrion will suffice for me, Lord Janos.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He took another swallow, dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet. He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear, its point enameled in dark red. And he was well and truly drunk.\nTyrion covered his mouth and belched politely. Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine, but he was very full. The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service. This evening they had supped on oxtail soup, summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red fennel, and crumbled cheese, hot crab pie, spiced squash, and quails drowned in butter. Each dish had come with its own wine. Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well. \u201cNo doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal,\u201d Tyrion said.\n\u201cFor a certainty. Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service, what do you say?\u201d\n\u201cWars have been fought over less,\u201d he said, and they both had a good long laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re a bold man to take Harrenhal for your seat. Such a grim place, and huge\u2026 costly to maintain. And some say cursed as well.\u201d\n\u201cShould I fear a pile of stone?\u201d He hooted at the notion. \u201cA bold man, you said. You must be bold, to rise. As I have. To Harrenhal, yes! And why not? You know. You are a bold man too, I sense. Small, mayhap, but bold.\u201d\n\u201cYou are too kind. More wine?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, truly, I\u2026 oh, gods be damned, yes. Why not? A bold man drinks his fill!\u201d\n\u201cTruly.\u201d Tyrion filled Lord Slynt\u2019s cup to the brim. \u201cI have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch.\u201d\n\u201cGood men. Fine men. Any of the six will do, but I\u2019d choose Allar Deem. My right arm. Good good man. Loyal. Pick him and you won\u2019t be sorry. If he pleases the king.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure.\u201d Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine. \u201cI had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater. He\u2019s been captain on the Mud Gate for three years, and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy\u2019s Rebellion. King Robert knighted him at Pyke. And yet his name does not appear on your list.\u201d\nLord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before swallowing. \u201cBywater. Well. Brave man, to be sure, yet\u2026 he\u2019s rigid, that one. A queer dog. The men don\u2019t like him. A cripple too, lost his hand at Pyke, that\u2019s what got him knighted. A poor trade, if you ask me, a hand for a ser.\u201d He laughed. \u201cSer Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor, as I see it. You\u2019ll do better leaving that one where he is, my lor\u2014Tyrion. Allar Deem\u2019s the man for you.\u201d\n\u201cDeem is little loved in the streets, I am told.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s feared. That\u2019s better.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it I heard of him? Some trouble in a brothel?\u201d\n\u201cThat. Not his fault, my lor\u2014Tyrion. No. He never meant to kill the woman, that was her own doing. He warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty.\u201d\n\u201cStill\u2026 mothers and children, he might have expected she\u2019d try to save the babe.\u201d Tyrion smiled. \u201cHave some of this cheese, it goes splendidly with the wine. Tell me, why did you choose Deem for that unhappy task?\u201d\n\u201cA good commander knows his men, Tyrion. Some are good for one job, some for another. Doing for a babe, and her still on the tit, that takes a certain sort. Not every man\u2019d do it. Even if it was only some whore and her whelp.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s so,\u201d said Tyrion, hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae, and Tysha long ago, and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years.\nSlynt went on, oblivious. \u201cA hard man for a hard job, is Deem. Does as he\u2019s told, and never a word afterward.\u201d He cut a slice off the cheese. \u201cThis is fine. Sharp. Give me a good sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and I\u2019m a happy man.\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cEnjoy it while you can. With the riverlands in flame and Renly king in Highgarden, good cheese will soon be hard to come by. So who sent you after the whore\u2019s bastard?\u201d\nLord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look, then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a sly one, Tyrion. Thought you could trick me, did you? it takes more than wine and cheese to make Janos Slynt tell more than he should. I pride myself. Never a question, and never a word afterward, not with me.\u201d\n\u201cAs with Deem.\u201d\n\u201cJust the same. You make him your Commander when I\u2019m off to Harrenhal, and you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\nTyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese. It was sharp indeed, and veined with wine; very choice. \u201cWhoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor, I can tell. Lord Mormont faces the same problem.\u201d\nLord Janos looked puzzled. \u201cI thought she was a lady. Mormont. Beds down with bears, that\u2019s the one?\u201d\n\u201cIt was her brother I was speaking of. Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. When I was visiting with him on the Wall, he mentioned how concerned he was about finding a good man to take his place. The Watch gets so few good men these days.\u201d Tyrion grinned. \u201cHe\u2019d sleep easier if he had a man like you, I imagine. Or the valiant Allar Deem.\u201d\nLord Janos roared. \u201cSmall chance of that!\u201d\n\u201cOne would think,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201cbut life does take queer turns. Consider Eddard Stark, my lord. I don\u2019t suppose he ever imagined his life would end on the steps of Baelor\u2019s Sept.\u201d\n\u201cThere were damn few as did,\u201d Lord Janos allowed, chuckling.\nTyrion chuckled too. \u201cA pity I wasn\u2019t here to see it. They say even Varys was surprised.\u201d\nLord Janos laughed so hard his gut shook. \u201cThe Spider,\u201d he said. \u201cKnows everything, they say. Well, he didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cHow could he?\u201d Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone. \u201cHe had helped persuade my sister that Stark should be pardoned, on the condition that he take the black.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d Janos Slynt blinked vaguely at Tyrion.\n\u201cMy sister Cersei,\u201d Tyrion repeated, a shade more strongly, in case the fool had some doubt who he meant. \u201cThe Queen Regent.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Slynt took a swallow. \u201cAs to that, well\u2026 the king commanded it, m\u2019lord. The king himself.\u201d\n\u201cThe king is thirteen,\u201d Tyrion reminded him.\n\u201cStill. He is the king.\u201d Slynt\u2019s jowls quivered when he frowned. \u201cThe Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\n\u201cWell, one or two of them, at least,\u201d Tyrion said with a sour smile. \u201cMight I have a look at your spear?\u201d\n\u201cMy spear?\u201d Lord Janos blinked in confusion.\nTyrion pointed. \u201cThe clasp that fastens your cape.\u201d\nHesitantly, Lord Janos drew out the ornament and handed it to Tyrion.\n\u201cWe have goldsmiths in Lannisport who do better work,\u201d he opined. \u201cThe red enamel blood is a shade much, if you don\u2019t mind my saying. Tell me, my lord, did you drive the spear into the man\u2019s back yourself, or did you only give the command?\u201d\n\u201cI gave the command, and I\u2019d give it again. Lord Stark was a traitor.\u201d The bald spot in the middle of Slynt\u2019s head was beet-red, and his cloth-of-gold cape had slithered off his shoulders onto the floor. \u201cThe man tried to buy me.\u201d\n\u201cLittle dreaming that you had already been sold.\u201d\nSlynt slammed down his wine cup. \u201cAre you drunk? If you think I will sit here and have my honor questioned\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat honor is that? I do admit, you made a better bargain than Ser Jacelyn. A lordship and a castle for a spear thrust in the back, and you didn\u2019t even need to thrust the spear.\u201d He tossed the golden ornament back to Janos Slynt. It bounced off his chest and clattered to the floor as the man rose.\n\u201cI mislike the tone of your voice, my lo\u2014Imp. I am the Lord of Harrenhal and a member of the king\u2019s council, who are you to chastise me like this?\u201d\nTyrion cocked his head sideways. \u201cI think you know quite well who I am. How many sons do you have?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are my sons to you, dwarf?\u201d\n\u201cDwarf?\u201d His anger flashed. \u201cYou should have stopped at Imp. I am Tyrion of House Lannister, and someday, if you have the sense the gods gave a sea slug, you will drop to your knees in thanks that it was me you had to deal with, and not my lord father. Now, how many sons do you have?\u201d\nTyrion could see the sudden fear in Janos Slynt\u2019s eyes. \u201cTh\u2014three, m\u2019lord. And a daughter. Please, m\u2019lord\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou need not beg.\u201d He slid off his chair. \u201cYou have my word, no harm will come to them. The younger boys will be fostered out as squires. If they serve well and loyally, they may be knights in time. Let it never be said that House Lannister does not reward those who serve it. Your eldest son will inherit the title Lord Slynt, and this appalling sigil of yours.\u201d He kicked at the little golden spear and sent it skittering across the floor. \u201cLands will be found for him, and he can build a seat for himself. It will not be Harrenhal, but it will be sufficient. It will be up to him to make a marriage for the girl.\u201d\nJanos Slynt\u2019s face had gone from red to white. \u201cWh-what\u2026 what do you\u2026?\u201d His jowls were quivering like mounds of suet.\n\u201cWhat do I mean to do with you?\u201d Tyrion let the oaf tremble for a moment before he answered. \u201cThe carrack Summer\u2019s Dream sails on the morning tide. Her master tells me she will call at Gulltown, the Three Sisters, the isle of Skagos, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. When you see Lord Commander Mormont, give him my fond regards, and tell him that I have not forgotten the needs of the Night\u2019s Watch. I wish you long life and good service, my lord.\u201d\nOnce Janos Slynt realized he was not to be summarily executed, color returned to his face. He thrust his jaw out. \u201cWe will see about this, Imp. Dwarf. Perhaps it will be you on that ship, what do you think of that? Perhaps it will be you on the Wall.\u201d He gave a bark of anxious laughter. \u201cYou and your threats, well, we will see. I am the king\u2019s friend, you know. We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. And Littlefinger and the queen, oh, yes. Janos Slynt has a good many friends. We will see who goes sailing, I promise you. Indeed we will.\u201d\nSlynt spun on his heel like the watchman he\u2019d once been, and strode the length of the Small Hall, boots ringing on the stone. He clattered up the steps, threw open the door\u2026 and came face-to-face with a tall, lantern-jawed man in black breastplate and gold cloak. Strapped to the stump of his right wrist was an iron hand. \u201cJanos,\u201d he said, deep-set eyes glinting under a prominent brow ridge and a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. Six gold cloaks moved quietly into the Small Hall behind him as Janos Slynt backed away.\n\u201cLord Slynt,\u201d Tyrion called out, \u201cI believe you know Ser Jacelyn Bywater, our new Commander of the City Watch.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a litter waiting for you, my lord,\u201d Ser Jacelyn told Slynt. \u201cThe docks are dark and distant, and the streets are not safe by night. Men.\u201d\nAs the gold cloaks ushered out their onetime commander, Tyrion called Ser Jacelyn to his side and handed him a roll of parchment. \u201cIt\u2019s a long voyage, and Lord Slynt will want for company. See that these six join him on the Summer\u2019s Dream.\u201d\nBywater glanced over the names and smiled. \u201cAs you will.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s one,\u201d Tyrion said quietly. \u201cDeem. Tell the captain it would not be taken amiss if that one should happen to be swept overboard before they reach Eastwatch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m told those northern waters are very stormy, my lord.\u201d Ser Jacelyn bowed and took his leave, his cloak rippling behind him. He trod on Slynt\u2019s cloth-of-gold cape on his way.\nTyrion sat alone, sipping at what remained of the fine sweet Dornish wine. Servants came and went, clearing the dishes from the table. He told them to leave the wine. When they were done, Varys came gliding into the hall, wearing flowing lavender robes that matched his smell. \u201cOh sweetly done, my good lord.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do I have this bitter taste in my mouth?\u201d He pressed his fingers into his temples. \u201cI told them to throw Allar Deem into the sea. I am sorely tempted to do the same with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be disappointed by the result,\u201d Varys replied. \u201cThe storms come and go, the waves crash overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling. Might I trouble you for a taste of the wine that Lord Slynt enjoyed so much?\u201d\nTyrion waved at the flagon, frowning.\nVarys filled a cup. \u201cAh. Sweet as summer.\u201d He took another sip. \u201cI hear the grapes singing on my tongue.\u201d\n\u201cI wondered what that noise was. Tell the grapes to keep still, my head is about to split. It was my sister. That was what the oh-so-loyal Lord Janos refused to say. Cersei sent the gold cloaks to that brothel.\u201d\nVarys tittered nervously. So he had known all along.\n\u201cYou left that part out,\u201d Tyrion said accusingly.\n\u201cYour own sweet sister,\u201d Varys said, so grief-stricken he looked close to tears. \u201cIt is a hard thing to tell a man, my lord. I was fearful how you might take it. Can you forgive me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tyrion snapped. \u201cDamn you. Damn her.\u201d He could not touch Cersei, he knew. Not yet, not even if he\u2019d wanted to, and he was far from certain that he did. Yet it rankled, to sit here and make a mummer\u2019s show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of Janos Slynt and Allar Deem, while his sister continued on her savage course. \u201cIn future, you will tell me what you know, Lord Varys. All of what you know.\u201d\nThe eunuch\u2019s smile was sly. \u201cThat might take rather a long time, my good lord. I know quite a lot.\u201d\n\u201cNot enough to save this child, it would seem.\u201d\n\u201cAlas, no. There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm\u2019s way\u2026 but I confess, I never dreamed the babe would be at risk. A baseborn girl, less than a year old, with a whore for a mother. What threat could she pose?\u201d\n\u201cShe was Robert\u2019s,\u201d Tyrion said bitterly. \u201cThat was enough for Cersei, it would seem.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It is grievous sad. I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother, who was so young and loved the king.\u201d\n\u201cDid she?\u201d Tyrion had never seen the dead girl\u2019s face, but in his mind she was Shae and Tysha both. \u201cCan a whore truly love anyone, I wonder? No, don\u2019t answer. Some things I would rather not know.\u201d He had settled Shae in a sprawling stone-and-timber manse, with its own well and stable and garden; he had given her servants to see to her wants, a white bird from the Summer Isles to keep her company, silks and silver and gemstones to adorn her, guards to protect her. And yet she seemed restive. She wanted to be with him more, she told him; she wanted to serve him and help him. \u201cYou help me most here, between the sheets,\u201d he told her one night after their loving as he lay beside her, his head pillowed against her breast, his groin aching with a sweet soreness. She made no reply, save with her eyes. He could see there that it was not what she\u2019d wanted to hear.\nSighing, Tyrion started to reach for the wine again, then remembered Lord Janos and pushed the flagon away. \u201cIt does seem my sister was telling the truth about Stark\u2019s death. We have my nephew to thank for that madness.\u201d\n\u201cKing Joffrey gave the command. Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne carried it out, swiftly, without hesitation\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026almost as if they had expected it. Yes, we have been over this ground before, without profit. A folly.\u201d\n\u201cWith the City Watch in hand, my lord, you are well placed to see to it that His Grace commits no further\u2026 follies? To be sure, there is still the queen\u2019s household guard to consider\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe red cloaks?\u201d Tyrion shrugged. \u201cVylarr\u2019s loyalty is to Casterly Rock. He knows I am here with my father\u2019s authority. Cersei would find it hard to use his men against me\u2026 besides, they are only a hundred. I have half again as many men of my own. And six thousand gold cloaks, if Bywater is the man you claim.\u201d\n\u201cYou will find Ser Jacelyn to be courageous, honorable, obedient\u2026 and most grateful.\u201d\n\u201cTo whom, I wonder?\u201d Tyrion did not trust Varys, though there was no denying his value. He knew things, beyond a doubt. \u201cWhy are you so helpful, my lord Varys?\u201d he asked, studying the man\u2019s soft hands, the bald powdered face, the slimy little smile.\n\u201cYou are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.\u201d\n\u201cAs you served Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark?\u201d\n\u201cI served Lord Arryn and Lord Stark as best I could. I was saddened and horrified by their most untimely deaths.\u201d\n\u201cThink how I feel. I\u2019m like to be next.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think not,\u201d Varys said, swirling the wine in his cup. \u201cPower is a curious thing, my lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?\u201d\n\u201cIt has crossed my mind a time or two,\u201d Tyrion admitted. \u201cThe king, the priest, the rich man\u2014who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It\u2019s a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many answers. All depends on the man with the sword.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet he is no one,\u201d Varys said. \u201cHe has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.\u201d\n\u201cThat piece of steel is the power of life and death.\u201d\n\u201cJust so\u2026 yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father? \u201c\n\u201cBecause these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.\u201d\n\u201cThen these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they? Whence came their swords? Why do they obey?\u201d Varys smiled. \u201cSome say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the gods. Others say it derives from law. Yet that day on the steps of Baelor\u2019s Sept, our godly High Septon and the lawful Queen Regent and your ever-so-knowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler or cooper in the crowd. Who truly killed Eddard Stark do you think? Joffrey, who gave the command? Ser Ilyn Payne, who swung the sword? Or\u2026 another? \u201c\nTyrion cocked his head sideways. \u201cDid you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my head ache worse?\u201d\nVarys smiled. \u201cHere, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.\u201d\n\u201cSo power is a mummer\u2019s trick?\u201d\n\u201cA shadow on the wall,\u201d Varys murmured, \u201cyet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.\u201d\nTyrion smiled. \u201cLord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you. I may kill you yet, but I think I\u2019d feel sad about it.\u201d\n\u201cI will take that as high praise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you, Varys?\u201d Tyrion found he truly wanted to know. \u201cA spider, they say.\u201d\n\u201cSpies and informers are seldom loved, my lord. I am but a loyal servant of the realm.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a eunuch. Let us not forget that.\u201d\n\u201cI seldom do.\u201d\n\u201cPeople have called me a halfman too, yet I think the gods have been kinder to me. I am small, my legs are twisted, and women do not look upon me with any great yearning\u2026 yet I\u2019m still a man. Shae is not the first to grace my bed, and one day I may take a wife and sire a son. If the gods are good, he\u2019ll look like his uncle and think like his father. You have no such hope to sustain you. Dwarfs are a jape of the gods\u2026 but men make eunuchs. Who cut you, Varys? When and why? Who are you, truly?\u201d\nThe eunuch\u2019s smile never flickered, but his eyes glittered with something that was not laughter. \u201cYou are kind to ask, my lord, but my tale is long and sad, and we have treasons to discuss.\u201d He drew a parchment from the sleeve of his robe. \u201cThe master of the King\u2019s Galley White Hart plots to slip anchor three days hence to offer his sword and ship to Lord Stannis.\u201d\nTyrion sighed. \u201cI suppose we must make some sort of bloody lesson out of the man?\u201d\n\u201cSer Jacelyn could arrange for him to vanish, but a trial before the king would help assure the continued loyalty of the other captains.\u201d\nAnd keep my royal nephew occupied as well. \u201cAs you say. Put him down for a dose of Joffrey\u2019s justice.\u201d\nVarys made a mark on the parchment. \u201cSer Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed a guard to let them out a postern gate, the night after next. Arrangements have been made for them to sail on the Pentoshi galley Moonrunner, disguised as oarsmen.\u201d\n\u201cCan we keep them on those oars for a few years, see how they fancy it?\u201d He smiled. \u201cNo, my sister would be distraught to lose such treasured guests. Inform Ser Jacelyn. Seize the man they bribed and explain what an honor it is to serve as a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. And have men posted around the Moonrunner, in case the Redwynes find a second guard short of coin.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d Another mark on the parchment. \u201cYour man Timett slew a wineseller\u2019s son this evening, at a gambling den on the Street of Silver. He accused him of cheating at tiles.\u201d\n\u201cWas it true?\u201d\n\u201cOh, beyond a doubt.\u201d\n\u201cThen the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude. I shall see that he has the king\u2019s thanks.\u201d\nThe eunuch gave a nervous giggle and made another mark. \u201cWe also have a sudden plague of holy men. The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests, preachers, and prophets, it would seem. They beg in the winesinks and pot-shops and foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen.\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cWe are close on the three hundredth year since Aegon\u2019s Landing, I suppose it is only to be expected. Let them rant.\u201d\n\u201cThey are spreading fear, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI thought that was your job.\u201d\nVarys covered his mouth with his hand. \u201cYou are very cruel to say so. One last matter. Lady Tanda gave a small supper last night. I have the menu and the guest list for your inspection. When the wine was poured, Lord Gyles rose to lift a cup to the king, and Ser Balon Swann was heard to remark, \u2018We\u2019ll need three cups for that.\u2019 Many laughed\u2026\u201d\nTyrion raised a hand. \u201cEnough. Ser Balon made a jest. I am not interested in treasonous table talk, Lord Varys.\u201d\n\u201cYou are as wise as you are gentle, my lord.\u201d The parchment vanished up the eunuch\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWe both have much to do. I shall leave you.\u201d\nWhen the eunuch had departed, Tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and wondering how his sister would take the news of Janos Slynt\u2019s dismissal. Not happily, if he was any judge, but beyond sending an angry protest to Lord Tywin in Harrenhal, he did not see what Cersei could hope to do about it. Tyrion had the City Watch now, plus a hundred-and-a-half fierce clansmen and a growing force of sellswords recruited by Bronn. He would seem well protected.\nDoubtless Eddard Stark thought the same.\nThe Red Keep was dark and still when Tyrion left the Small Hall. Bronn was waiting in his solar. \u201cSlynt?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cLord Janos will be sailing for the Wall on the morning tide. Varys would have me believe that I have replaced one of Joffrey\u2019s men with one of my own. More likely, I have replaced Littlefinger\u2019s man with one belonging to Varys, but so be it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d best know, Timett killed a man\u2014\u201d\n\u201cVarys told me.\u201d\nThe sellsword seemed unsurprised. \u201cThe fool figured a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat. Timett pinned his wrist to the table with a dagger and ripped out his throat barehanded. He has this trick where he stiffens his fingers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpare me the grisly details, my supper is sitting badly in my belly,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cHow goes your recruiting?\u201d\n\u201cWell enough. Three new men tonight.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know which ones to hire?\u201d\n\u201cI look them over. I question them, to learn where they\u2019ve fought and how well they lie.\u201d Bronn smiled. \u201cAnd then I give them a chance to kill me, while I do the same for them.\u201d\n\u201cHave you killed any?\u201d\n\u201cNo one we could have used.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if one of them kills you?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be one you\u2019ll want to hire.\u201d\nTyrion was a little drunk, and very tired. \u201cTell me, Bronn. If I told you to kill a babe\u2026 an infant girl, say, still at her mother\u2019s breast\u2026 would you do it? Without question?\u201d\n\u201cWithout question? No.\u201d The sellsword rubbed thumb and forefinger together. \u201cI\u2019d ask how much.\u201d\nAnd why would I ever need your Allar Deem, Lord Slynt? Tyrion thought. I have a hundred of my own. He wanted to laugh; he wanted to weep; most of all, he wanted Shae.",

      "content": "Arya\nThe road was little more than two ruts through the weeds.\nThe good part was, with so little traffic there\u2019d be no one to point the finger and say which way they\u2019d gone. The human flood that had flowed down the kingsroad was only a trickle here.\nThe bad part was, the road wound back and forth like a snake, tangling with even smaller trails and sometimes seeming to vanish entirely only to reappear half a league farther on when they had all but given up hope. Arya hated it. The land was gentle enough, rolling hills and terraced fields interspersed with meadows and woodlands and little valleys where willows crowded close to slow shallow streams. Even so, the path was so narrow and crooked that their pace had dropped to a crawl.\nIt was the wagons that slowed them, lumbering along, axles creaking under the weight of their heavy loads. A dozen times a day they had to stop to free a wheel that had stuck in a rut, or double up the teams to climb a muddy slope. Once, in the middle of a dense stand of oak, they came face-to-face with three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart, with no way for either to get around. There had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched their ox, led him through the trees, spun the cart, hitched the ox up again, and started back the way they\u2019d come. The ox was even slower than the wagons, so that day they hardly got anywhere at all.\nArya could not help looking over her shoulder, wondering when the gold cloaks would catch them. At night, she woke at every noise to grab for Needle\u2019s hilt. They never made camp without putting out sentries now, but Arya did not trust them, especially the orphan boys. They might have done well enough in the alleys of King\u2019s Landing, but out here they were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy Greenhands had the watch, she shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until she was right above his head, and he never saw a thing. She would have jumped down on top of him, but she knew his scream would wake the whole camp, and Yoren might take a stick to her again.\nLommy and the other orphans all treated the Bull like someone special now because the queen wanted his head, though he would have none of it. \u201cI never did nothing to no queen,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI did my work, is all. Bellows and tongs and fetch and carry. I was s\u2019posed to be an armorer, and one day Master Mott says I got to join the Night\u2019s Watch, that\u2019s all I know.\u201d Then he\u2019d go off to polish his helm. It was a beautiful helm, rounded and curved, with a slit visor and two great metal bull\u2019s horns. Arya would watch him polish the metal with an oilcloth, shining it so bright you could see the flames of the cookfire reflected in the steel. Yet he never actually put it on his head.\n\u201cI bet he\u2019s that traitor\u2019s bastard,\u201d Lommy said one night, in a hushed voice so Gendry would not hear. \u201cThe wolf lord, the one they nicked on Baelor\u2019s steps.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not,\u201d Arya declared. My father only had one bastard, and that\u2019s Jon. She stalked off into the trees, wishing she could just saddle her horse and ride home. She was a good horse, a chestnut mare with a white blaze on her forehead. And Arya had always been a good rider. She could gallop off and never see any of them, unless she wanted to. Only then she\u2019d have no one to scout ahead of her, or watch behind, or stand guard while she napped, and when the gold cloaks caught her, she\u2019d be all alone. It was safer to stay with Yoren and the others.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not far from Gods Eye,\u201d the black brother said one morning. \u201cThe kingsroad won\u2019t be safe till we\u2019re across the Trident. So we\u2019ll come up around the lake along the western shore, they\u2019re not like to look for us there.\u201d At the next spot where two ruts cut cross each other, he turned the wagons west.\nHere farmland gave way to forest, the villages and holdfasts were smaller and farther apart, the hills higher and the valleys deeper. Food grew harder to come by. In the city, Yoren had loaded up the wagons with salt fish, hard bread, lard, turnips, sacks of beans and barley, and wheels of yellow cheese, but every bite of it had been eaten. Forced to live off the land, Yoren turned to Koss and Kurz, who\u2019d been taken as poachers. He would send them ahead of the column, into the woods, and come dusk they would be back with a deer slung between them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging from their belts. The younger boys would be set to picking blackberries along the road, or climbing fences to fill a sack with apples if they happened upon an orchard.\nArya was a skilled climber and a fast picker, and she liked to go off by herself. One day she came across a rabbit, purely by happenstance. It was brown and fat, with long ears and a twitchy nose. Rabbits ran faster than cats, but they couldn\u2019t climb trees half so well. She whacked it with her stick and grabbed it by its ears, and Yoren stewed it with some mushrooms and wild onions. Arya was given a whole leg, since it was her rabbit. She shared it with Gendry. The rest of them each got a spoonful, even the three in manacles. Jaqen H\u2019ghar thanked her politely for the treat, and Biter licked the grease off his dirty fingers with a blissful look, but Rorge, the noseless one, only laughed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hunter now. Lumpyface Lumpyhead Rabbitkiller.\u201d\nOutside a holdfast called Briarwhite, some fieldhands surrounded them in a cornfield, demanding coin for the ears they\u2019d taken. Yoren eyed their scythes and tossed them a few coppers. \u201cTime was, a man in black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high lords called it an honor to shelter him under their roofs,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cNow cravens like you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple.\u201d He spat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sweetcorn, better\u2019n a stinking old black bird like you deserves,\u201d one of them answered roughly. \u201cYou get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with you, or we\u2019ll stake you up in the corn to scare the other crows away.\u201d\nThey roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night, turning the ears with long forked sticks, and ate it hot right off the cob. Arya thought it tasted wonderful, but Yoren was too angry to eat. A cloud seemed to hang over him, ragged and black as his cloak. He paced about the camp restlessly, muttering to himself.\nThe next day Koss came racing back to warn Yoren of a camp ahead. \u201cTwenty or thirty men, in mail and halfhelms,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are cut up bad, and one\u2019s dying, from the sound of him. With all the noise he was making, I got right up close. They got spears and shields, but only one horse, and that\u2019s lame. I think they been there awhile, from the stink of the place.\u201d\n\u201cSee a banner?\u201d\n\u201cSpotted treecat, yellow and black, on a mud-brown field.\u201d\nYoren folded a sourleaf into his mouth and chewed. \u201cCan\u2019t say,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMight be one side, might be t\u2019other. If they\u2019re hurt that bad, likely they\u2019d take our mounts no matter who they are. Might be they\u2019d take more than that. I believe we\u2019ll go wide around them.\u201d It took them miles out of their way, and cost them two days at the least, but the old man said it was cheap at the price. \u201cYou\u2019ll have time enough on the Wall. The rest o\u2019 your lives, most like. Seems to me there\u2019s no rush to get there. \u201c\nArya saw men guarding the fields more and more when they turned north again. Often they stood silently beside the road, giving a cold eye to anyone who passed. Elsewhere they patrolled on horses, riding their fence lines with axes strapped to their saddles. At one place, she spotted a man perched up in a dead tree, with a bow in his hand and a quiver hanging from the branch beside him. The moment he spied them, he notched an arrow to his bowstring, and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight. All the while, Yoren cursed. \u201cHim in his tree, let\u2019s see how well he likes it up there when the Others come to take him. He\u2019ll scream for the Watch then, that he will.\u201d\nA day later Dobber spied a red glow against the evening sky. \u201cEither this road went and turned again, or that sun\u2019s setting in the north.\u201d\nYoren climbed a rise to get a better look. \u201cFire,\u201d he announced. He licked a thumb and held it up. \u201cWind should blow it away from us. Still bears watching.\u201d\nAnd watch it they did. As the world darkened, the fire seemed to grow brighter and brighter, until it looked as though the whole north was ablaze. From time to time, they could even smell the smoke, though the wind held steady and the flames never got any closer. By dawn the fire had burned itself out, but none of them slept very well that night.\nIt was midday when they arrived at the place where the village had been. The fields were a charred desolation for miles around, the houses blackened shells. The carcasses of burnt and butchered animals dotted the ground, under living blankets of carrion crows that rose, cawing furiously, when disturbed. Smoke still drifted from inside the holdfast. Its timber palisade looked strong from afar, but had not proved strong enough.\nRiding out in front of the wagons on her horse, Arya saw burnt bodies impaled on sharpened stakes atop the walls, their hands drawn up tight in front of their faces as if to fight off the flames that had consumed them. Yoren called a halt when they were still some distance off, and told Arya and the other boys to guard the wagons while he and Murch and Cutjack went in on foot. A flock of ravens rose from inside the walls when they climbed through the broken gate, and the caged ravens in their wagons called out to them with quorks and raucous shrieks.\n\u201cShould we go in after them?\u201d Arya asked Gendry after Yoren and the others had been gone a long time.\n\u201cYoren said wait.\u201d Gendry\u2019s voice sounded hollow. When Arya turned to look, she saw that he was wearing his helm, all shiny steel and great curving horns.\nWhen they finally returned, Yoren had a little girl in his arms, and Murch and Cutjack were carrying a woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt. The girl was no older than two and she cried all the time, a whimpery sound, like something was caught in her throat. Either she couldn\u2019t talk yet or she had forgotten how. The woman\u2019s right arm ended in a bloody stump at her elbow, and her eyes didn\u2019t seem to see anything, even when she was looking right at it. She talked, but she only said one thing. \u201cPlease,\u201d she cried, over and over. \u201cPlease. Please.\u201d Rorge thought that was funny. He laughed through the hole in his face where his nose had been, and Biter started laughing too, until Murch cursed them and told them to shut up.\nYoren had them fix the woman a place in the back of a wagon. \u201cAnd be quick about it,\u201d he said. \u201cCome dark, there\u2019ll be wolves here, and worse.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Hot Pie murmured when he saw the one-armed woman thrashing in the wagon.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Arya confessed.\nHe squeezed her shoulder. \u201cI never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry. I just sold my mommy\u2019s pies, is all.\u201d\nArya rode as far ahead of the wagons as she dared, so she wouldn\u2019t have to hear the little girl crying or listen to the woman whisper, \u201cPlease.\u201d She remembered a story Old Nan had told once, about a man imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants. He was very brave and smart and he tricked the giants and escaped\u2026 but no sooner was he outside the castle than the Others took him, and drank his hot red blood. Now she knew how he must have felt.\nThe one-armed woman died at evenfall. Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blew, Arya thought she could hear the long trailing branches whispering, \u201cPlease. Please. Please.\u201d The little hairs on the back of her neck rose, and she almost ran from the graveside.\n\u201cNo fire tonight,\u201d Yoren told them. Supper was a handful of wild radishes Koss found, a cup of dry beans, water from a nearby brook. The water had a funny taste to it, and Lommy told them it was the taste of bodies, rotting someplace upstream. Hot Pie would have hit him if old Reysen hadn\u2019t pulled them apart.\nArya drank too much water, just to fill her belly with something. She never thought she\u2019d be able to sleep, yet somehow she did. When she woke, it was pitch-black and her bladder was full to bursting. Sleepers huddled all around her, wrapped in blankets and cloaks. Arya found Needle, stood, listened. She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry, men turning in restless sleep, Rorge\u2019s rattling snores, and the queer hissing sound that Biter made when he slept. From a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as Yoren sat, chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk.\nHot Pie was one of the boys on watch. \u201cWhere you going?\u201d he asked when he saw Arya heading for the trees.\nArya waved vaguely at the woods.\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Hot Pie said. He had gotten bolder again now that he had a sword on his belt, even though it was just a shortsword and he handled it like a cleaver. \u201cThe old man said for everyone to stay close tonight.\u201d\n\u201cI need to make water,\u201d Arya explained.\n\u201cWell, use that tree right there.\u201d He pointed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there, Arry. I heard wolves before.\u201d\nYoren wouldn\u2019t like it if she fought with him. She tried to look afraid. \u201cWolves? For true?\u201d\n\u201cI heard,\u201d he assured her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to go after all.\u201d She went back to her blanket and pretended to sleep until she heard Hot Pie\u2019s footsteps going away. Then she rolled over and slipped off into the woods on the other side of the camp, quiet as a shadow. There were sentries out this way too, but Arya had no trouble avoiding them. Just to make sure, she went out twice as far as usual. When she was sure there was no one near, she skinned down her breeches and squatted to do her business.\nShe was making water, her clothing tangled about her ankles, when she heard rustling from under the trees. Hot Pie, she thought in panic, he followed me. Then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood, bright with reflected moonlight. Her belly clenched tight as she grabbed for Needle, not caring if she pissed herself, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a whole pack\u2026\nOne of them came padding out from under the trees. He stared at her, and bared his teeth, and all she could think was how stupid she\u2019d been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they found her half-eaten body the next morning. But the wolf turned and raced back into the darkness, and quick as that the eyes were gone. Trembling, she cleaned herself and laced up and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp, and to Yoren. Arya climbed up into the wagon beside him, shaken. \u201cWolves,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cIn the woods.\u201d\n\u201cAye. They would be.\u201d He never looked at her.\n\u201cThey scared me.\u201d\n\u201cDid they?\u201d He spat. \u201cSeems to me your kind was fond o\u2019 wolves.\u201d\n\u201cNymeria was a direwolf.\u201d Arya hugged herself. \u201cThat\u2019s different. Anyhow, she\u2019s gone. Jory and I threw rocks at her until she ran off, or else the queen would have killed her.\u201d It made her sad to talk about it. \u201cI bet if she\u2019d been in the city, she wouldn\u2019t have let them cut off Father\u2019s head.\u201d\n\u201cOrphan boys got no fathers,\u201d Yoren said, \u201cor did you forget that?\u201d The sourleaf had turned his spit red, so it looked like his mouth was bleeding. \u201cThe only wolves we got to fear are the ones wear manskin, like those who done for that village.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I was home,\u201d she said miserably. She tried so hard to be brave, to be fierce as a wolverine and all, but sometimes she felt like she was just a little girl after all.\nThe black brother peeled a fresh sourleaf from the bale in the wagon and stuffed it into his mouth. \u201cMight be I should of left you where I found you, boy. All of you. Safer in the city, seems to me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cBeen bringing men to the Wall for close on thirty years.\u201d Froth shone on Yoren\u2019s lips, like bubbles of blood. \u201cAll that time, I only lost three. Old man died of a fever, city boy got snakebit taking a shit, and one fool tried to kill me in my sleep and got a red smile for his trouble.\u201d He drew the dirk across his throat, to show her. \u201cThree in thirty years.\u201d He spat out the old sourleaf. \u201cA ship now, might have been wiser. No chance o\u2019 finding more men on the way, but still\u2026 clever man, he\u2019d go by ship, but me\u2026 thirty years I been taking this kingsroad.\u201d He sheathed his dirk. \u201cGo to sleep, boy. Hear me?\u201d\nShe did try. Yet as she lay under her thin blanket, she could hear the wolves howling\u2026 and another sound, fainter, no more than a whisper on the wind, that might have been screams.",

      "content": "Davos\nThe morning air was dark with the smoke of burning gods.\nThey were all afire now, Maid and Mother, Warrior and Smith, the Crone with her pearl eyes and the Father with his gilded beard; even the Stranger, carved to look more animal than human. The old dry wood and countless layers of paint and varnish blazed with a fierce hungry light. Heat rose shimmering through the chill air; behind, the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred, as if Davos were seeing them through a veil of tears. Or as if the beasts were trembling, stirring\u2026\n\u201cAn ill thing,\u201d Allard declared, though at least he had the sense to keep his voice low. Dale muttered agreement.\n\u201cSilence,\u201d said Davos. \u201cRemember where you are.\u201d His sons were good men, but young, and Allard especially was rash. Had I stayed a smuggler, Allard would have ended on the Wall. Stannis spared him from that end, something else I owe him\u2026\nHundreds had come to the castle gates to bear witness to the burning of the Seven. The smell in the air was ugly. Even for soldiers, it was hard not to feel uneasy at such an affront to the gods most had worshiped all their lives.\nThe red woman walked round the fire three times, praying once in the speech of Asshai, once in High Valyrian, and once in the Common Tongue. Davos understood only the last. \u201cR\u2019hllor, come to us in our darkness,\u201d she called. \u201cLord of Light, we offer you these false gods, these seven who are one, and him the enemy. Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d Queen Selyse echoed the words. Beside her, Stannis watched impassively, his jaw hard as stone under the blue-black shadow of his tight-cropped beard. He had dressed more richly than was his wont, as if for the sept.\nDragonstone\u2019s sept had been where Aegon the Conqueror knelt to pray the night before he sailed. That had not saved it from the queen\u2019s men. They had overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass with warhammers. Septon Barre could only curse them, but Ser Hubard Rambton led his three sons to the sept to defend their gods. The Rambtons had slain four of the queen\u2019s men before the others overwhelmed them. Afterward Guncer Sunglass, mildest and most pious of lords, told Stannis he could no longer support his claim. Now he shared a sweltering cell with the septon and Ser Hubard\u2019s two surviving sons. The other lords had not been slow to take the lesson.\nThe gods had never meant much to Davos the smuggler, though like most men he had been known to make offerings to the Warrior before battle, to the Smith when he launched a ship, and to the Mother whenever his wife grew great with child. He felt ill as he watched them burn, and not only from the smoke.\nMaester Cressen would have stopped this. The old man had challenged the Lord of Light and been struck down for his impiety, or so the gossips told each other. Davos knew the truth. He had seen the maester slip something into the wine cup. Poison. What else could it be? He drank a cup of death to free Stannis from Melisandre, but somehow her god shielded her. He would gladly have killed the red woman for that, yet what chance would he have where a maester of the Citadel had failed? He was only a smuggler raised high, Davos of Flea Bottom, the Onion Knight.\nThe burning gods cast a pretty light, wreathed in their robes of shifting flame, red and orange and yellow. Septon Barre had once told Davos how they\u2019d been carved from the masts of the ships that had carried the first Targaryens from Valyria. Over the centuries, they had been painted and repainted, gilded, silvered, jeweled. \u201cTheir beauty will make them more pleasing to R\u2019hllor,\u201d Melisandre said when she told Stannis to pull them down and drag them out the castle gates.\nThe Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, her arms widespread as if to embrace him. The Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face. A longsword had been thrust through her heart, and its leather grip was alive with flame. The Father was on the bottom, the first to fall. Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by one, reduced to so much glowing charcoal. Nearby, Lord Celtigar coughed fitfully and covered his wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs. The Myrmen swapped jokes as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire, but young Lord Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey, and Lord Velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration.\nDavos would have given much to know what he was thinking, but one such as Velaryon would never confide in him. The Lord of the Tides was of the blood of ancient Valyria, and his House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes; Davos Seaworth stank of fish and onions. It was the same with the other lordlings. He could trust none of them, nor would they ever include him in their private councils. They scorned his sons as well. My grandsons will joust with theirs, though, and one day their blood may wed with mine. In time my little black ship will fly as high as Velaryon\u2019s seahorse or Celtigar\u2019s red crabs.\nThat is, if Stannis won his throne. If he lost\u2026\nEverything I am, I owe to him. Stannis had raised him to knighthood. He had given him a place of honor at his table, a war galley to sail in place of a smuggler\u2019s skiff. Dale and Allard captained galleys as well, Maric was oarmaster on the Fury, Matthos served his father on Black Betha, and the king had taken Devan as a royal squire. One day he would be knighted, and the two little lads as well. Marya was mistress of a small keep on Cape Wrath, with servants who called her m\u2019lady, and Davos could hunt red deer in his own woods. All this he had of Stannis Baratheon, for the price of a few finger joints. It was just, what he did to me. I had flouted the king\u2019s laws all my life. He has earned my loyalty. Davos touched the little pouch that hung from the leather thong about his neck. His fingers were his luck, and he needed luck now. As do we all. Lord Stannis most of all.\nPale flames licked at the grey sky. Dark smoke rose, twisting and curling. When the wind pushed it toward them, men blinked and wept and rubbed their eyes. Allard turned his head away, coughing and cursing. A taste of things to come, thought Davos. Many and more would burn before this war was done.\nMelisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire. \u201cIn ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\u201d She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. \u201cAzor Ahai, beloved of R\u2019hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!\u201d\nStannis Baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle. His squires stepped up to attend him. Davos watched as his son Devan pulled a long padded glove over the king\u2019s right hand. The boy wore a cream-colored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast. Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around His Grace\u2019s neck. Behind, Davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells. \u201cUnder the sea, smoke rises in bubbles, and flames burn green and blue and black,\u201d Patchface sang somewhere. \u201cI know, I know, oh, oh, oh.\u201d\nThe king plunged into the fire with his teeth clenched, holding the leather cloak before him to keep off the flames. He went straight to the Mother, grasped the sword with his gloved hand, and wrenched it free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk. Then he was retreating, the sword held high, jade-green flames swirling around cherry-red steel. Guards rushed to beat out the cinders that clung to the king\u2019s clothing.\n\u201cA sword of fire!\u201d shouted Queen Selyse. Ser Axell Florent and the other queen\u2019s men took up the cry. \u201cA sword of fire! It burns! It burns! A sword of fire!\u201d\nMelisandre lifted her hands above her head. \u201cBehold! A sign was promised, and now a sign is seen! Behold Lightbringer! Azor Ahai has come again! All hail the Warrior of Light! All hail the Son of Fire!\u201d\nA ragged wave of shouts gave answer, just as Stannis\u2019s glove began to smolder. Cursing, the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against his leg.\n\u201cLord, cast your light upon us!\u201d Melisandre called out.\n\u201cFor the night is dark and full of terrors,\u201d Selyse and her queen\u2019s men replied. Should I speak the words as well? Davos wondered. Do I owe Stannis that much? Is this fiery god truly his own? His shortened fingers twitched.\nStannis peeled off the glove and let it fall to the ground. The gods in the pyre were scarcely recognizable anymore. The head fell off the Smith with a puff of ash and embers. Melisandre sang in the tongue of Asshai, her voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea. Stannis untied his singed leather cape and listened in silence. Thrust in the ground, Lightbringer still glowed ruddy hot, but the flames that clung to the sword were dwindling and dying.\nBy the time the song was done, only charwood remained of the gods, and the king\u2019s patience had run its course. He took the queen by the elbow and escorted her back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer where it stood. The red woman remained a moment to watch as Devan knelt with Byren Farring and rolled up the burnt and blackened sword in the king\u2019s leather cloak. The Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess, thought Davos.\nA few of the lords lingered to speak in quiet voices upwind of the fire. They fell silent when they saw Davos looking at them. Should Stannis fall, they will pull me down in an instant. Neither was he counted one of the queen\u2019s men, that group of ambitious knights and minor lordlings who had given themselves to this Lord of Light and so won the favor and patronage of Lady\u2014no, Queen, remember?\u2014Selyse.\nThe fire had started to dwindle by the time Melisandre and the squires departed with the precious sword. Davos and his sons joined the crowd making its way down to the shore and the waiting ships. \u201cDevan acquitted himself well,\u201d he said as they went.\n\u201cHe fetched the glove without dropping it, yes,\u201d said Dale.\nAllard nodded. \u201cThat badge on Devan\u2019s doublet, the fiery heart, what was that? The Baratheon sigil is a crowned stag.\u201d\n\u201cA lord can choose more than one badge,\u201d Davos said.\nDale smiled. \u201cA black ship and an onion, Father?\u201d\nAllard kicked at a stone. \u201cThe Others take our onion\u2026 and that flaming heart. It was an ill thing to burn the Seven.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you grow so devout?\u201d Davos said. \u201cWhat does a smuggler\u2019s son know of the doings of gods?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a knight\u2019s son, Father. If you won\u2019t remember, why should they? \u201c\n\u201cA knight\u2019s son, but not a knight,\u201d said Davos. \u201cNor will you ever be, if you meddle in affairs that do not concern you. Stannis is our rightful king, it is not for us to question him. We sail his ships and do his bidding. That is all.\u201d\n\u201cAs to that, Father,\u201d Dale said, \u201cI mislike these water casks they\u2019ve given me for Wraith. Green pine. The water will spoil on a voyage of any length.\u201d\n\u201cI got the same for Lady Marya,\u201d said Allard. \u201cThe queen\u2019s men have laid claim to all the seasoned wood.\u201d\n\u201cI will speak to the king about it,\u201d Davos promised. Better it come from him than from Allard. His sons were good fighters and better sailors, but they did not know how to talk to lords. They were lowborn, even as I was, but they do not like to recall that. When they look at our banner, all they see is a tall black ship flying on the wind. They close their eyes to the onion.\nThe port was as crowded as Davos had ever known it. Every dock teemed with sailors loading provisions, and every inn was packed with soldiers dicing or drinking or looking for a whore\u2026 a vain search, since Stannis permitted none on his island. Ships lined the strand; war galleys and fishing vessels, stout carracks and fat-bottomed cogs. The best berths had been taken by the largest vessels: Stannis\u2019s flagship Fury rocking between Lord Steffon and Stag of the Sea, Lord Velaryon\u2019s silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark and her three sisters, Lord Celtigar\u2019s ornate Red Claw, the ponderous Swordfish with her long iron prow. Out to sea at anchor rode Salladhor Saan\u2019s great Valyrian amongst the striped hulls of two dozen smaller Lysene galleys.\nA weathered little inn sat on the end of the stone pier where Black Betha, Wraith, and Lady Marya shared mooring space with a half-dozen other galleys of one hundred oars or less. Davos had a thirst. He took his leave of his sons and turned his steps toward the inn. Out front squatted a waist-high gargoyle, so eroded by rain and salt that his features were all but obliterated. He and Davos were old friends, though. He gave a pat to the stone head as he went in. \u201cLuck,\u201d he murmured.\nAcross the noisy common room, Salladhor Saan sat eating grapes from a wooden bowl. When he spied Davos, he beckoned him closer. \u201cSer knight, come sit with me. Eat a grape. Eat two. They are marvelously sweet.\u201d The Lyseni was a sleek, smiling man whose flamboyance was a byword on both sides of the narrow sea. Today he wore flashing cloth-of-silver, with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor. His buttons were carved jade monkeys, and atop his wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers.\nDavos threaded his way through the tables to a chair. In the days before his knighthood, he had often bought cargoes from Salladhor Saan. The Lyseni was a smuggler himself, as well as a trader, a banker, a notorious pirate, and the self-styled Prince of the Narrow Sea. When a pirate grows rich enough, they make him a prince. It had been Davos who had made the journey to Lys to recruit the old rogue to Lord Stannis\u2019s cause.\n\u201cYou did not see the gods burn, my lord?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe red priests have a great temple on Lys. Always they are burning this and burning that, crying out to their R\u2019hllor. They bore me with their fires. Soon they will bore King Stannis too, it is to be hoped.\u201d He seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear him, eating his grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto his lip, flicking them off with a finger. \u201cMy Bird of a Thousand Colors came in yesterday, good ser. She is not a warship, no, but a trader, and she paid a call on King\u2019s Landing. Are you sure you will not have a grape? Children go hungry in the city, it is said.\u201d He dangled the grapes before Davos and smiled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ale I need, and news.\u201d\n\u201cThe men of Westeros are ever rushing,\u201d complained Salladhor Saan. \u201cWhat good is this, I ask you? He who hurries through life hurries to his grave.\u201d He belched. \u201cThe Lord of Casterly Rock has sent his dwarf to see to King\u2019s Landing. Perhaps he hopes that his ugly face will frighten off attackers, eh? Or that we will laugh ourselves dead when the Imp capers on the battlements, who can say? The dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks and put in his place a knight with an iron hand.\u201d He plucked a grape, and squeezed it between thumb and forefinger until the skin burst. juice ran down between his fingers.\nA serving girl pushed her way through, swatting at the hands that groped her as she passed. Davos ordered a tankard of ale, turned back to Saan, and said, \u201cHow well is the city defended?\u201d\nThe other shrugged. \u201cThe walls are high and strong, but who will man them? They are building scorpions and spitfires, oh, yes, but the men in the golden cloaks are too few and too green, and there are no others. A swift strike, like a hawk plummeting at a hare, and the great city will be ours. Grant us wind to fill our sails, and your king could sit upon his Iron Throne by evenfall on the morrow. We could dress the dwarf in motley and prick his little cheeks with the points of our spears to make him dance for us, and mayhaps your goodly king would make me a gift of the beautiful Queen Cersei to warm my bed for a night. I have been too long away from my wives, and all in his service.\u201d\n\u201cPirate,\u201d said Davos. \u201cYou have no wives, only concubines, and you have been well paid for every day and every ship.\u201d\n\u201cOnly in promises,\u201d said Salladhor Saan mournfully. \u201cGood ser, it is gold I crave, not words on papers.\u201d He popped a grape into his mouth.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have your gold when we take the treasury in King\u2019s Landing. No man in the Seven Kingdoms is more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. He will keep his word.\u201d Even as Davos spoke, he thought, This world is twisted beyond hope, when lowborn smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.\n\u201cSo he has said and said. And so I say, let us do this thing. Even these grapes could be no more ripe than that city, my old friend.\u201d\nThe serving girl returned with his ale. Davos gave her a copper. \u201cMight be we could take King\u2019s Landing, as you say,\u201d he said as he lifted the tankard, \u201cbut how long would we hold it? Tywin Lannister is known to be at Harrenhal with a great host, and Lord Renly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, the young brother,\u201d said Salladhor Saan. \u201cThat part is not so good, my friend. King Renly bestirs himself. No, here he is Lord Renly, my pardons. So many kings, my tongue grows weary of the word. The brother Renly has left Highgarden with his fair young queen, his flowered lords and shining knights, and a mighty host of foot. He marches up your road of roses toward the very same great city we were speaking of.\u201d\n\u201cHe takes his bride?\u201d\nThe other shrugged. \u201cHe did not tell me why. Perhaps he is loath to part with the warm burrow between her thighs, even for a night. Or perhaps he is that certain of his victory.\u201d\n\u201cThe king must be told.\u201d\n\u201cI have attended to it, good ser. Though His Grace frowns so whenever he does see me that I tremble to come before him. Do you think he would like me better if I wore a hair shirt and never smiled? Well, I will not do it. I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.\u201d\nThe sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. \u201cSword?\u201d\n\u201cA sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cA burning sword,\u201d corrected Davos.\n\u201cBurnt,\u201d said Salladhor Saan, \u201cand be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero\u2019s blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.\n\u201cBeing a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast\u2019s red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.\n\u201cA hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. \u2018Nissa Nissa\u2019 he said to her, for that was her name, \u2018bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.\u2019 She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.\n\u201cNow do you see my meaning? Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire. Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns.\u201d Salladhor Saan finished the last grape and smacked his lips. \u201cWhen do you think the king will bid us sail, good ser? \u201c\n\u201cSoon, I think,\u201d said Davos, \u201cif his god wills it.\u201d\n\u201cHis god, ser friend? Not yours? Where is the god of Ser Davos Seaworth, knight of the onion ship?\u201d\nDavos sipped his ale to give himself a moment. The inn is crowded, and you are not Salladhor Saan, he reminded himself. Be careful how you answer. \u201cKing Stannis is my god. He made me and blessed me with his trust.\u201d\n\u201cI will remember.\u201d Salladhor Saan got to his feet. \u201cMy pardons. These grapes have given me a hunger, and dinner awaits on my Valyrian. Minced lamb with pepper and roasted gull stuffed with mushrooms and fennel and onion. Soon we shall eat together in King\u2019s Landing, yes? In the Red Keep we shall feast, while the dwarf sings us a jolly tune. When you speak to King Stannis, mention if you would that he will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon. He ought to have given those gods to me. They were too beautiful to burn, and might have brought a noble price in Pentos or Myr. Well, if he grants me Queen Cersei for a night I shall forgive him.\u201d The Lyseni clapped Davos on the back, and swaggered from the inn as if he owned it.\nSer Davos Seaworth lingered over his tankard for a good while, thinking. A year ago, he had been with Stannis in King\u2019s Landing when King Robert staged a tourney for Prince Joffrey\u2019s name day. He remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr, and the flaming sword he had wielded in the melee. The man had made for a colorful spectacle, his red robes flapping while his blade writhed with pale green flames, but everyone knew there was no true magic to it, and in the end his fire had guttered out and Bronze Yohn Royce had brained him with a common mace.\nA true sword of fire, now, that would be a wonder to behold. Yet at such a cost\u2026 When he thought of Nissa Nissa, it was his own Marya he pictured, a good-natured plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile, the best woman in the world. He tried to picture himself driving a sword through her, and shuddered. I am not made of the stuff of heroes, he decided. If that was the price of a magic sword, it was more than he cared to pay.\nDavos finished his ale, pushed away the tankard, and left the inn. On the way out he patted the gargoyle on the head and muttered, \u201cLuck.\u201d They would all need it.\nIt was well after dark when Devan came down to Black Betha, leading a snow-white palfrey. \u201cMy lord father,\u201d he announced, \u201cHis Grace commands you to attend him in the Chamber of the Painted Table. You are to ride the horse and come at once.\u201d\nIt was good to see Devan looking so splendid in his squire\u2019s raiment, but the summons made Davos uneasy. Will he bid us sail? he wondered. Salladhor Saan was not the only captain who felt that King\u2019s Landing was ripe for an attack, but a smuggler must learn patience. We have no hope of victory. I said as much to Maester Cressen, the day I returned to Dragonstone, and nothing has changed. We are too few, the foes too many. ff we dip our oars, we die. Nonetheless, he climbed onto the horse.\nWhen Davos arrived at the Stone Drum, a dozen highborn knights and great bannermen were just leaving. Lords Celtigar and Velaryon each gave him a curt nod and walked on while the others ignored him utterly, but Ser Axell Florent stopped for a word.\nQueen Selyse\u2019s uncle was a keg of a man with thick arms and bandy legs. He had the prominent ears of a Florent, even larger than his niece\u2019s. The coarse hair that sprouted from his did not stop him hearing most of what went on in the castle. For ten years Ser Axell had served as castellan of Dragonstone while Stannis sat on Robert\u2019s council in King\u2019s Landing, but of late he had emerged as the foremost of the queen\u2019s men. \u201cSer Davos, it is good to see you, as ever,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd you, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI made note of you this morning as well. The false gods burned with a merry light, did they not?\u201d\n\u201cThey burned brightly.\u201d Davos did not trust this man, for all his courtesy. House Florent had declared for Renly.\n\u201cThe Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes R\u2019hllor permits his faithful servants to glimpse the future in flames. It seemed to me as I watched the fire this morning that I was looking at a dozen beautiful dancers, maidens garbed in yellow silk spinning and swirling before a great king. I think it was a true vision, ser. A glimpse of the glory that awaits His Grace after we take King\u2019s Landing and the throne that is his by rights.\u201d\nStannis has no taste for such dancing, Davos thought, but he dared not offend the queen\u2019s uncle. \u201cI saw only fire,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the smoke was making my eyes water. You must pardon me, ser, the king awaits.\u201d He pushed past, wondering why Ser Axell had troubled himself. He is a queen\u2019s man and I am the king\u2019s.\nStannis sat at his Painted Table with Maester Pylos at his shoulder, an untidy pile of papers before them. \u201cSer,\u201d the king said when Davos entered, \u201ccome have a look at this letter.\u201d\nObediently, he selected a paper at random. \u201cIt looks handsome enough, Your Grace, but I fear I cannot read the words.\u201d Davos could decipher maps and charts as well as any, but letters and other writings were beyond his powers. But my Devan has learned his letters, and young Steffon and Stannis as well.\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d A furrow of irritation showed between the king\u2019s brows. \u201cPylos, read it to him.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d The maester took up one of the parchments and cleared his throat. \u201cAll men know me for the trueborn son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm\u2019s End, by his lady wife Cassana of House Estermont. I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother Robert, our late king, left no trueborn issue of his body, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being abominations born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Let all true men declare their loyalty. Done in the Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d The parchment rustled softly as Pylos laid it down.\n\u201cMake it Ser Jaime the Kingslayer henceforth,\u201d Stannis said, frowning. \u201cWhatever else the man may be, he remains a knight. I don\u2019t know that we ought to call Robert my beloved brother either. He loved me no more than he had to, nor I him.\u201d\n\u201cA harmless courtesy, Your Grace,\u201d Pylos said.\n\u201cA lie. Take it out.\u201d Stannis turned to Davos. \u201cThe maester tells me that we have one hundred seventeen ravens on hand. I mean to use them all. One hundred seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. Perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow. If so, a hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and bedchambers\u2026 and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire, and lips pledged to silence. These great lords love Joffrey, or Renly, or Robb Stark. I am their rightful king, but they will deny me if they can. So I have need of you.\u201d\n\u201cI am yours to command, my king. As ever.\u201d\nStannis nodded. \u201cI mean for you to sail Black Betha north, to Gulltown, the Fingers, the Three Sisters, even White Harbor. Your son Dale will go south in Wraith, past Cape Wrath and the Broken Arm, all along the coast of Dorne as far as the Arbor. Each of you will carry a chest of letters, and you will deliver one to every port and holdfast and fishing village. Nail them to the doors of septs and inns for every man to read who can.\u201d\nDavos said, \u201cThat will be few enough.\u201d\n\u201cSer Davos speaks truly, Your Grace,\u201d said Maester Pylos. \u201cIt would be better to have the letters read aloud.\u201d\n\u201cBetter, but more dangerous,\u201d said Stannis. \u201cThese words will not be kindly received.\u201d\n\u201cGive me knights to do the reading,\u201d Davos said. \u201cThat will carry more weight than anything I might say.\u201d\nStannis seemed well satisfied with that. \u201cI can give you such men, yes. I have a hundred knights who would sooner read than fight. Be open where you can and stealthy where you must. Use every smuggler\u2019s trick you know, the black sails, the hidden coves, whatever it requires. If you run short of letters, capture a few septons and set them to copying out more. I mean to use your second son as well. He will take Lady Marya across the narrow sea, to Braavos and the other Free Cities, to deliver other letters to the men who rule there. The world will know of my claim, and of Cersei\u2019s infamy.\u201d\nYou can tell them, Davos thought, but will they believe? He glanced thoughtfully at Maester Pylos. The king caught the look. \u201cMaester, perhaps you ought get to your writing. We will need a great many letters, and soon.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will.\u201d Pylos bowed, and took his leave.\nThe king waited until he was gone before he said, \u201cWhat is it you would not say in the presence of my maester, Davos?\u201d\n\u201cMy liege, Pylos is pleasant enough, but I cannot see the chain about his neck without mourning for Maester Cressen.\u201d\n\u201cIs it his fault the old man died?\u201d Stannis glanced into the fire. \u201cI never wanted Cressen at that feast. He\u2019d angered me, yes, he\u2019d given me bad counsel, but I did not want him dead. I\u2019d hoped he might be granted a few years of ease and comfort. He had earned that much, at least, but\u201d\u2014he ground his teeth together\u2014\u201cbut he died. And Pylos serves me ably.\u201d\n\u201cPylos is the least of it. The letter\u2026 What did your lords make of it, I wonder?\u201d\nStannis snorted. \u201cCeltigar pronounced it admirable. If I showed him the contents of my privy, he would declare that admirable as well. The others bobbed their heads up and down like a flock of geese, all but Velaryon, who said that steel would decide the matter, not words on parchment. As if I had never suspected. The Others take my lords, I\u2019ll hear your views.\u201d\n\u201cYour words were blunt and strong.\u201d\n\u201cAnd true.\u201d\n\u201cAnd true. Yet you have no proof. Of this incest. No more than you did a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s proof of a sort at Storm\u2019s End. Robert\u2019s bastard. The one he fathered on my wedding night, in the very bed they\u2019d made up for me and my bride. Delena was a Florent, and a maiden when he took her, so Robert acknowledged the babe. Edric Storm, they call him. He is said to be the very image of my brother. If men were to see him, and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen, they could not help but wonder, I would think.\u201d\n\u201cYet how are men to see him, if he is at Storm\u2019s End?\u201d\nStannis drummed his fingers on the Painted Table. \u201cIt is a difficulty. One of many.\u201d He raised his eyes. \u201cYou have more to say about the letter. Well, get on with it. I did not make you a knight so you could learn to mouth empty courtesies. I have my lords for that. Say what you would say, Davos.\u201d\nDavos bowed his head. \u201cThere was a phrase at the end. How did it go? Done in the Light of the Lord\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The king\u2019s jaw was clenched.\n\u201cYour people will mislike those words.\u201d\n\u201cAs you did?\u201d said Stannis sharply.\n\u201cIf you were to say instead, Done in the sight of gods and men, or By the grace of the gods old and new\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHave you gone devout on me, smuggler?\u201d\n\u201cThat was to be my question for you, my liege.\u201d\n\u201cWas it now? It sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new maester.\u201d\n\u201cI do not know this Lord of Light,\u201d Davos admitted, \u201cbut I knew the gods we burned this morning. The Smith has kept my ships safe, while the Mother has given me seven strong sons.\u201d\n\u201cYour wife has given you seven strong sons. Do you pray to her? It was wood we burned this morning.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so,\u201d Davos said, \u201cbut when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a copper, sometimes the septons would feed me.\u201d\n\u201cI feed you now.\u201d\n\u201cYou have given me an honored place at your table. And in return I give you truth. Your people will not love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped, and give them one whose very name sounds queer on their tongues.\u201d\nStannis stood abruptly. \u201cR\u2019hllor. Why is that so hard? They will not love me, you say? When have they ever loved me? How can I lose something I have never owned?\u201d He moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea. \u201cI stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King\u2019s Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.\u201d\n\u201cIf you do not believe in gods\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014why trouble with this new one?\u201d Stannis broke in. \u201cI have asked myself as well. I know little and care less of gods, but the red priestess has power.\u201d\nYes, but what sort of power? \u201cCressen had wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cI trusted in his wisdom and your wiles, and what did they avail me, smuggler? The storm lords sent you packing. I went to them a beggar and they laughed at me. Well, there will be no more begging, and no more laughing either. The Iron Throne is mine by rights, but how am I to take it? There are four kings in the realm, and three of them have more men and more gold than I do. I have ships\u2026 and I have her. The red woman. Half my knights are afraid even to say her name, did you know? If she can do nothing else, a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised. A frightened man is a beaten man. And perhaps she can do more. I mean to find out.\n\u201cWhen I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health. Proudwing, I named her. She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand, but she would not soar. Time and again I would take her hawking, but she never flew higher than the treetops. Robert called her Weakwing. He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike. One day our great-uncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird. I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing, he said, and he was right.\u201d Stannis Baratheon turned away from the window, and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea. \u201cThe Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow. It is time I tried another hawk, Davos. A red hawk.\u201d",

      "content": "Theon\nThere was no safe anchorage at Pyke, but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on his father\u2019s castle from the sea, to see it as he had seen it last, ten years before, when Robert Baratheon\u2019s war galley had borne him away to be a ward of Eddard Stark. On that day he had stood beside the rail, listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master\u2019s drum while he watched Pyke dwindle in the distance. Now he wanted to see it grow larger, to rise from the sea before him.\nObedient to his wishes, the Myraham beat her way past the point with her sails snapping and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings. Theon drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray, and looked for home.\nThe shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs, and the castle seemed one with the rest, its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone, wet by the same salt waves, festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen, speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds. The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean, but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered, thousands of years past. All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god\u2019s temple, while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them.\nDrear, dark, forbidding, Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars, almost a part of them, its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet, dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep. Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep, each on its own island. Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond, linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close, by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not.\nThe Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword, the oldest part of the castle, round and tall, the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves. The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray, the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket, the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire.\nAbove the Sea Tower snapped his father\u2019s banner. The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself, but he knew the device it bore: the golden kraken of House Greyjoy, arms writhing and reaching against a black field. The banner streamed from an iron mast, shivering and twisting as the wind gusted, like a bird struggling to take flight. And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above, casting its shadow down upon the Greyjoy kraken.\nTheon had never seen a more stirring sight. In the sky behind the castle, the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin, scuttling clouds. All the way from Riverrun to Seagard, the Mallisters had argued about its meaning. It is my comet, Theon told himself, sliding a hand into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket. Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given him, paper as good as a crown.\n\u201cDoes the castle look as you remember it, milord?\u201d the captain\u2019s daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm.\n\u201cIt looks smaller,\u201d Theon confessed, \u201cthough perhaps that is only the distance.\u201d The Myraham was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown, carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore. Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well, and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver, so he stayed well out, farther than Theon would have liked. An ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the Great Keep, but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft, the crew, nor the courage to attempt such a thing. So they sailed past at a safe distance, and Theon must content himself with seeing Pyke from afar. Even so, the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks.\n\u201cIt must be windy there,\u201d the captain\u2019s daughter observed.\nHe laughed. \u201cWindy and cold and damp. A miserable hard place, in truth\u2026 but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men, and hard men rule the world.\u201d\nThe captain\u2019s face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked, \u201cMay we make for port now, milord?\u201d\n\u201cYou may,\u201d Theon said, a faint smile playing about his lips. The promise of gold had turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle. It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he\u2019d hoped. Ironborn captains were proud and willful, and did not go in awe of a man\u2019s blood. The islands were too small for awe, and a longship smaller still. If every captain was a king aboard his own ship, as was often said, it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings. And when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm, it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods. \u201cThe Drowned God makes men,\u201d old King Urron Redhand had once said, thousands of years ago, \u201cbut it\u2019s men who make crowns.\u201d\nA longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well. The Myraham was a wallowing tub, if truth be told, and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm. Still, Theon could not be too unhappy. He was here, undrowned, and the voyage had offered certain other amusements. He put an arm around the captain\u2019s daughter. \u201cSummon me when we make Lordsport,\u201d he told her father. \u201cWe\u2019ll be below, in my cabin.\u201d He led the girl away aft, while her father watched them go in sullen silence.\nThe cabin was the captain\u2019s, in truth, but it had been turned over to Theon\u2019s use when they sailed from Seagard. The captain\u2019s daughter had not been turned over to his use, but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same. A cup of wine, a few whispers, and there she was. The girl was a shade plump for his taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her. That was surprising at her age, but Theon found it diverting. He did not think the captain approved, and that was amusing as well, watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord, the rich purse of gold he\u2019d been promised never far from his thoughts.\nAs Theon shrugged out of his wet cloak, the girl said, \u201cYou must be so happy to see your home again, milord. How many years have you been away? \u201c\n\u201cTen, or close as makes no matter,\u201d he told her. \u201cI was a boy of ten when I was taken to Winterfell. as a ward of Eddard Stark.\u201d A ward in name, a hostage in truth. Half his days a hostage\u2026 but no longer. His life was his own again, and nowhere a Stark to be seen. He drew the captain\u2019s daughter close and kissed her on her ear. \u201cTake off your cloak.\u201d\nShe dropped her eyes, suddenly shy, but did as he bid her. When the heavy garment, sodden with spray, fell from her shoulders to the deck, she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously. She looked rather stupid when she smiled, but he had never required a woman to be clever. \u201cCome here,\u201d he told her.\nShe did. \u201cI have never seen the Iron Islands.\u201d\n\u201cCount yourself fortunate.\u201d Theon stroked her hair. it was fine and dark, though the wind had made a tangle of it. \u201cThe islands are stern and stony places, scant of comfort and bleak of prospect. Death is never far here, and life is mean and meager. Men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse, the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil. If truth be told, the miners have it worse than either, breaking their backs down in the dark, and for what? Iron, lead, tin, those are our treasures. Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding.\u201d\nThe stupid girl did not seem to be listening. \u201cI could go ashore with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI would, if it please you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou could go ashore,\u201d Theon agreed, squeezing her breast, \u201cbut not with me, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d work in your castle, milord. I can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter. Father says my peppercrab stew is the best he\u2019s ever tasted. You could find me a place in your kitchens and I could make you peppercrab stew.\u201d\n\u201cAnd warm my bed by night?\u201d He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo them, his fingers deft and practiced. \u201cOnce I might have carried you home as a prize, and kept you to wife whether you willed it or no. The ironmen of old did such things. A man had his rock wife, his true bride, ironborn like himself, but he had his salt wives too, women captured on raids.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s eyes grew wide, and not because he had bared her breasts. \u201cI would be your salt wife, milord.\u201d\n\u201cI fear those days are gone.\u201d Theon\u2019s finger circled one heavy teat, spiraling in toward the fat brown nipple. \u201cNo longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword, taking what we want. Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men, and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter.\u201d He took her nipple in his mouth, and bit it until she gasped.\n\u201cYou can put it in me again, if it please you,\u201d she whispered in his ear as he sucked.\nWhen he raised his head from her breast, the skin was dark red where his mouth had marked her. \u201cIt would please me to teach you something new. Unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth.\u201d\n\u201cWith my mouth?\u201d\nHis thumb brushed lightly over her full lips. \u201cIt\u2019s what those lips were made for, sweetling. If you were my salt wife, you\u2019d do as I command.\u201d\nShe was timid at first, but learned quickly for such a stupid girl, which pleased him. Her mouth was as wet and sweet as her cunt, and this way he did not have to listen to her mindless prattle. Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth, he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair. Once. When we still kept the Old Way, lived by the axe instead of the pick, taking what we would, be it wealth, women, or glory. In those days, the ironborn did not work mines; that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings, and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep. War was an ironman\u2019s proper trade. The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song.\nAegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren, gave Harren\u2019s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen, and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm. Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands, even behind the high stone halls of Pyke. Theon\u2019s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper, and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow.\nIt had been to bring back the Old Way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that Lord Balon had staged his great rebellion. Robert Baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope, with the help of his friend Eddard Stark, but both men were dead now. Mere boys ruled in their stead, and the realm that Aegon the Conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered. This is the season, Theon thought as the captain\u2019s daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him, the season, the year, the day, and I am the man. He smiled crookedly, wondering what his father would say when Theon told him that he, the last-born, babe and hostage, he had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed.\nHis climax came on him sudden as a storm, and he filled the girl\u2019s mouth with his seed. Startled, she tried to pull away, but Theon held her tight by the hair. Afterward, she crawled up beside him. \u201cDid I please milord?\u201d\n\u201cWell enough,\u201d he told her.\n\u201cIt tasted salty,\u201d she murmured.\n\u201cLike the sea?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cI have always loved the sea, milord.\u201d\n\u201cAs I have,\u201d he said, rolling her nipple idly between his fingers. It was true. The sea meant freedom to the men of the Iron Islands. He had forgotten that until the Myraham had raised sail at Seagard. The sounds brought old feelings back; the creak of wood and rope, the captain\u2019s shouted commands, the snap of the sails as the wind filled them, each as familiar as the beating of his own heart, and as comforting. I must remember this, Theon vowed to himself. I must never go far from the sea again.\n\u201cTake me with you, milord,\u201d the captain\u2019s daughter begged. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go to your castle. I can stay in some town, and be your salt wife.\u201d She reached out to stroke his cheek.\nTheon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk. \u201cMy place is Pyke, and yours is on this ship.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay here now.\u201d\nHe laced up his breeches. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cMy father,\u201d she told him. \u201cOnce you\u2019re gone, he\u2019ll punish me, milord. He\u2019ll call me names and hit me.\u201d\nTheon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders. \u201cFathers are like that,\u201d he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp. \u201cTell him he should be pleased. As many times as I\u2019ve fucked you, you\u2019re likely with child. It\u2019s not every man who has the honor of raising a king\u2019s bastard.\u201d She looked at him stupidly, so he left her there.\nThe Myraham was rounding a wooded point. Below the pine-clad bluffs, a dozen fishing boats were pulling in their nets. The big cog stayed well out from them, tacking. Theon moved to the bow for a better view. He saw the castle first, the stronghold of the Botleys. When he was a boy it had been timber and wattle, but Robert Baratheon had razed that structure to the ground. Lord Sawane had rebuilt in stone, for now a small square keep crowned the hill. Pale green flags drooped from the squat corner towers, each emblazoned with a shoal of silvery fish.\nBeneath the dubious protection of the fish-ridden little castle lay the village of Lordsport, its harbor aswarm with ships. When last he\u2019d seen Lordsport, it had been a smoking wasteland, the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans, the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes. After ten years, few traces of the war remained. The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old, and cut fresh sod for their roofs. A new inn had risen beside the landing, twice the size of the old one, with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber. The sept beyond had never been rebuilt, though; only a seven-sided foundation remained where it had stood. Robert Baratheon\u2019s fury had soured the ironmen\u2019s taste for the new gods, it would seem.\nTheon was more interested in ships than gods. Among the masts of countless fishing boats, he spied a Tyroshi trading galley off-loading beside a lumbering Ibbenese cog with her black-tarred hull. A great number of longships, fifty or sixty at the least, stood out to sea or lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north. Some of the sails bore devices from the other islands; the blood moon of Wynch, Lord Goodbrother\u2019s banded black warhorn, Harlaw\u2019s silver scythe. Theon searched for his uncle Euron\u2019s Silence. Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign, but his father\u2019s Great Kraken was there, her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake.\nHad Lord Balon anticipated him and called the Greyjoy banners? His hand went inside his cloak again, to the oilskin pouch. No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark; they were no fools, to entrust their secrets to a bird. Still, Lord Balon was no fool either. He might well have guessed why his son was coming home at long last, and acted accordingly.\nThe thought did not please him. His father\u2019s war was long done, and lost. This was Theon\u2019s hour\u2014his plan, his glory, and in time his crown. Yet if the longships are hosting\u2026\nIt might be only a caution, now that he thought on it. A defensive move, lest the war spill out across the sea. Old men were cautious by nature. His father was old now, and so too his uncle Victarion, who commanded the Iron Fleet. His uncle Euron was a different song, to be sure, but the Silence did not seem to be in port. It\u2019s all for the good, Theon told himself. This way, I shall be able to strike all the more quickly.\nAs the Myraham made her way landward, Theon paced the deck restlessly, scanning the shore. He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside, but surely his father would have sent someone to meet him. Sylas Sourmouth the steward, Lord Botley, perhaps even Dagmer Cleftjaw. It would be good to look on Dagmer\u2019s hideous old face again. It was not as though they had no word of his arrival. Robb had sent ravens from Riverrun, and when they\u2019d found no longship at Seagard, Jason Mallister had sent his own birds to Pyke, supposing that Robb\u2019s were lost.\nYet he saw no familiar faces, no honor guard waiting to escort him from Lordsport to Pyke, only smallfolk going about their small business. Shorehands rolled casks of wine off the Tyroshi trader, fisherfolk cried the day\u2019s catch, children ran and played. A priest in the seawater robes of the Drowned God was leading a pair of horses along the pebbled shore, while above him a slattern leaned out a window in the inn, calling out to some passing Ibbenese sailors.\nA handful of Lordsport merchants had gathered to meet the ship. They shouted questions as the Myraham was tying up. \u201cWe\u2019re out of Oldtown,\u201d the captain called down, \u201cbearing apples and oranges, wines from the Arbor, feathers from the Summer Isles. I have pepper, woven leathers, a bolt of Myrish lace, mirrors for milady, a pair of Oldtown woodharps sweet as any you ever heard.\u201d The gangplank descended with a creak and a thud. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought your heir back to you.\u201d\nThe Lordsport men gazed on Theon with blank, bovine eyes, and he realized that they did not know who he was. It made him angry. He pressed a golden dragon into the captain\u2019s palm. \u201cHave your men bring my things.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, he strode down the gangplank. \u201cInnkeeper,\u201d he barked, \u201cI require a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, m\u2019lord,\u201d the man responded, without so much as a bow. He had forgotten how bold the ironborn could be. \u201cHappens as I have one might do. Where would you be riding, m\u2019lord?\u201d\n\u201cPyke.\u201d The fool still did not know him. He should have worn his good doublet, with the kraken embroidered on the breast.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to be off soon, to reach Pyke afore dark,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cMy boy will go with you and show you the way.\u201d\n\u201cYour boy will not be needed,\u201d a deep voice called, \u201cnor your horse. I shall see my nephew back to his father\u2019s house.\u201d\nThe speaker was the priest he had seen leading the horses along the shoreline. As the man approached, the smallfolk bent the knee, and Theon heard the innkeeper murmur, \u201cDamphair.\u201d\nTall and thin, with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose, the priest was garbed in mottled robes of green and grey and blue, the swirling colors of the Drowned God. A waterskin hung under his arm on a leather strap, and ropes of dried seaweed were braided through his waist-long black hair and untrimmed beard.\nA memory prodded at Theon. in one of his rare curt letters, Lord Balon had written of his youngest brother going down in a storm, and turning holy when he washed up safe on shore. \u201cUncle Aeron?\u201d he said doubtfully.\n\u201cNephew Theon,\u201d the priest replied. \u201cYour lord father bid me fetch you. Come.\u201d\n\u201cIn a moment, Uncle.\u201d He turned back to the Myraham. \u201cMy things,\u201d he commanded the captain.\nA sailor fetched him down his tall yew bow and quiver of arrows, but it was the captain\u2019s daughter who brought the pack with his good clothing. \u201cMilord.\u201d Her eyes were red. When he took the pack, she made as if to embrace him, there in front of her own father and his priestly uncle and half the island.\nTheon turned deftly aside. \u201cYou have my thanks.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201cI do love you well, milord.\u201d\n\u201cI must go.\u201d He hurried after his uncle, who was already well down the pier. Theon caught him with a dozen long strides. \u201cI had not looked for you, Uncle. After ten years, I thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come themselves, or send Dagmer with an honor guard.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not for you to question the commands of the Lord Reaper of Pyke.\u201d The priest\u2019s manner was chilly, most unlike the man Theon remembered. Aeron Greyjoy had been the most amiable of his uncles, feckless and quick to laugh, fond of songs, ale, and women. \u201cAs to Dagmer, the Cleftjaw is gone to Old Wyk at your father\u2019s behest, to roust the Stonehouses and the Drumms.\u201d\n\u201cTo what purpose? Why are the longships hosting?\u201d\n\u201cWhy have longships ever hosted?\u201d His uncle had left the horses tied up in front of the waterside inn. When they reached them, he turned to Theon. \u201cTell me true, nephew. Do you pray to the wolf gods now?\u201d\nTheon seldom prayed at all, but that was not something you confessed to a priest, even your father\u2019s own brother. \u201cNed Stark prayed to a tree. No, I care nothing for Stark\u2019s gods.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Kneel.\u201d\nThe ground was all stones and mud. \u201cUncle, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKneel. Or are you too proud now, a lordling of the green lands come among us?\u201d\nTheon knelt. He had a purpose here, and might need Aeron\u2019s help to achieve it. A crown was worth a little mud and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed.\n\u201cBow your head.\u201d Lifting the skin, his uncle pulled the cork and directed a thin stream of seawater down upon Theon\u2019s head. It drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his eyes. Sheets washed down his cheeks, and a finger crept under his cloak and doublet and down his back, a cold rivulet along his spine. The salt made his eyes burn, until it was all he could do not to cry out. He could taste the ocean on his lips. \u201cLet Theon your servant be born again from the sea, as you were,\u201d Aeron Greyjoy intoned. \u201cBless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel. Nephew, do you still know the words?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is dead may never die,\u201d Theon said, remembering.\n\u201cWhat is dead may never die,\u201d his uncle echoed, \u201cbut rises again, harder and stronger. Stand.\u201d\nTheon stood, blinking back tears from the salt in his eyes. Wordless, his uncle corked the waterskin, untied his horse, and mounted. Theon did the same. They set off together, leaving the inn and the harbor behind them, up past the castle of Lord Botley into the stony hills. The priest ventured no further word.\n\u201cI have been half my life away from home,\u201d Theon ventured at last. \u201cWill I find the islands changed?\u201d\n\u201cMen fish the sea, dig in the earth, and die. Women birth children in blood and pain, and die. Night follows day. The winds and tides remain. The islands are as our god made them.\u201d\nGods, he has grown grim, Theon thought. \u201cWill I find my sister and my lady mother at Pyke?\u201d\n\u201cYou will not. Your mother dwells on Harlaw, with her own sister. It is less raw there, and her cough troubles her. Your sister has taken Black Wind to Great Wyk, with messages from your lord father. She will return e\u2019er long, you may be sure.\u201d\nTheon did not need to be told that Black Wind was Asha\u2019s longship. He had not seen his sister in ten years, but that much he knew of her. Odd that she would call it that, when Robb Stark had a wolf named Grey Wind. \u201cStark is grey and Greyjoy\u2019s black,\u201d he murmured, smiling, \u201cbut it seems we\u2019re both windy.\u201d\nThe priest had nothing to say to that.\n\u201cAnd what of you, Uncle?\u201d Theon asked. \u201cYou were no priest when I was taken from Pyke. I remember how you would sing the old reaving songs standing on the table with a horn of ale in hand.\u201d\n\u201cYoung I was, and vain,\u201d Aeron Greyjoy said, \u201cbut the sea washed my follies and my vanities away. That man drowned, nephew. His lungs filled with seawater, and the fish ate the scales off his eyes. When I rose again, I saw clearly.\u201d\nHe is as mad as he is sour. Theon had liked what he remembered of the old Aeron Greyjoy. \u201cUncle, why has my father called his swords and sails?\u201d\n\u201cDoubtless he will tell you at Pyke.\u201d\n\u201cI would know his plans now.\u201d\n\u201cFrom me, you shall not. We are commanded not to speak of this to any man.\u201d\n\u201cEven to me?\u201d Theon\u2019s anger flared. He\u2019d led men in war, hunted with a king, won honor in tourney melees, ridden with Brynden Blackfish and Greatjon Umber, fought in the Whispering Wood, bedded more girls than he could name, and yet this uncle was treating him as though he were still a child of ten. \u201cIf my father makes plans for war, I must know of them. I am not \u2018any man,\u2019 I am heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.\u201d\n\u201cAs to that,\u201d his uncle said, \u201cwe shall see.\u201d\nThe words were a slap in the face. \u201cWe shall see? My brothers are both dead. I am my lord father\u2019s only living son.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister lives.\u201d\nAsha, he thought, confounded. She was three years older than Theon, yet still\u2026\u201cA woman may inherit only if there is no male heir in the direct line,\u201d he insisted loudly. \u201cI will not be cheated of my rights, I warn you.\u201d\nHis uncle grunted. \u201cYou warn a servant of the Drowned God, boy? You have forgotten more than you know. And you are a great fool if you believe your lord father will ever hand these holy islands over to a Stark. Now be silent. The ride is long enough without your magpie chatterings.\u201d\nTheon held his tongue, though not without struggle. So that is the way of it, he thought. As if ten years in Winterfell could make a Stark. Lord Eddard had raised him among his own children, but Theon had never been one of them. The whole castle, from Lady Stark to the lowliest kitchen scullion, knew he was hostage to his father\u2019s good behavior, and treated him accordingly. Even the bastard Jon Snow had been accorded more honor than he had.\nLord Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon he had always remained the man who\u2019d brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. As a boy, he had lived in fear of Stark\u2019s stern face and great dark sword. His wife was, if anything, even more distant and suspicious.\nAs for their children, the younger ones had been mewling babes for most of his years at Winterfell. Only Robb and his baseborn half brother Jon Snow had been old enough to be worth his notice. The bastard was a sullen boy, quick to sense a slight, jealous of Theon\u2019s high birth and Robb\u2019s regard for him. For Robb himself, Theon did have a certain affection, as for a younger brother\u2026 but it would be best not to mention that. In Pyke, it would seem, the old wars were still being fought. That ought not surprise him. The Iron Islands lived in the past; the present was too hard and bitter to be borne. Besides, his father and uncles were old, and the old lords were like that; they took their dusty feuds to the grave, forgetting nothing and forgiving less.\nIt had been the same with the Mallisters, his companions on the ride from Riverrun to Seagard. Patrek Mallister was not too ill a fellow; they shared a taste for wenches, wine, and hawking. But when old Lord Jason saw his heir growing overly fond of Theon\u2019s company, he had taken Patrek aside to remind him that Seagard had been built to defend the coast against reavers from the Iron islands, the Greyjoys of Pyke chief among them. Their Booming Tower was named for its immense bronze bell, rung of old to call the townsfolk and farmhands into the castle when longships were sighted on the western horizon.\n\u201cNever mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years,\u201d Patrek had told Theon the day after, as he shared his father\u2019s cautions and a jug of green-apple wine.\n\u201cWhen my brother stormed Seagard,\u201d Theon said. Lord Jason had slain Rodrik Greyjoy under the walls of the castle, and thrown the ironmen back into the bay. \u201cIf your father supposes I bear him some enmity for that, it\u2019s only because he never knew Rodrik.\u201d\nThey had a laugh over that as they raced ahead to an amorous young miller\u2019s wife that Patrek knew. Would that Patrek were with me now. Mallister or no, he was a more amiable riding companion than this sour old priest that his uncle Aeron had turned into.\nThe path they rode wound up and up, into bare and stony hills. Soon they were out of sight of the sea, though the smell of salt still hung sharp in the damp air. They kept a steady plodding pace, past a shepherd\u2019s croft and the abandoned workings of a mine. This new, holy Aeron Greyjoy was not much for talk. They rode in a gloom of silence. Finally Theon could suffer it no longer. \u201cRobb Stark is Lord of Winterfell now,\u201d he said.\nAeron rode on. \u201cOne wolf is much like the other.\u201d\n\u201cRobb has broken fealty with the Iron Throne and crowned himself King in the North. There\u2019s war.\u201d\n\u201cThe maester\u2019s ravens fly over salt as soon as rock. This news is old and cold.\u201d\n\u201cIt means a new day, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cEvery morning brings a new day, much like the old.\u201d\n\u201cIn Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new age. A messenger from the gods.\u201d\n\u201cA sign it is,\u201d the priest agreed, \u201cbut from our god, not theirs. A burning brand it is, such as our people carried of old. It is the flame the Drowned God brought from the sea, and it proclaims a rising tide. It is time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and sword, as he did.\u201d\nTheon smiled. \u201cI could not agree more.\u201d\n\u201cA man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm.\u201d\nThis raindrop will one day be a king, old man. Theon had suffered quite enough of his uncle\u2019s gloom. He put his spurs into his horse and trotted on ahead, smiling.\nIt was nigh on sunset when they reached the walls of Pyke, a crescent of dark stone that ran from cliff to cliff, with the gatehouse in the center and three square towers to either side. Theon could still make out the scars left by the stones of Robert Baratheon\u2019s catapults. A new south tower had risen from the ruins of the old, its stone a paler shade of grey, and as yet unmarred by patches of lichen. That was where Robert had made his breach, swarming in over the rubble and corpses with his warharnmer in hand and Ned Stark at his side. Theon had watched from the safety of the Sea Tower, and sometimes he still saw the torches in his dreams, and heard the dull thunder of the collapse.\nThe gates stood open to him, the rusted iron portcullis drawn up. The guards atop the battlements watched with strangers\u2019 eyes as Theon Greyjoy came home at last.\nBeyond the curtain wall were half a hundred acres of headland hard against the sky and the sea. The stables were here, and the kennels, and a scatter of other outbuildings. Sheep and swine huddled in their pens while the castle dogs ran free. To the south were the cliffs, and the wide stone bridge to the Great Keep. Theon could hear the crashing of waves as he swung down from his saddle. A stableman came to take his horse. A pair of gaunt children and some thralls stared at him with dull eyes, but there was no sign of his lord father, nor anyone else he recalled from boyhood. A bleak and bitter homecoming, he thought.\nThe priest had not dismounted. \u201cWill you not stay the night and share our meat and mead, Uncle?\u201d\n\u201cBring you, I was told. You are brought. Now I return to our god\u2019s business.\u201d Aeron Greyjoy turned his horse and rode slowly out beneath the muddy spikes of the portcullis.\nA bentback old crone in a shapeless grey dress approached him warily. \u201cM\u2019lord, I am sent to show you to chambers.\u201d\n\u201cBy whose bidding?\u201d\n\u201cYour lord father, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nTheon pulled off his gloves. \u201cSo you do know who I am. Why is my father not here to greet me?\u201d\n\u201cHe awaits you in the Sea Tower, m\u2019lord. When you are rested from your trip.\u201d\nAnd I thought Ned Stark cold. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d\n\u201cHelya, who keeps this castle for your lord father.\u201d\n\u201cSylas was steward here. They called him Sourmouth.\u201d Even now, Theon could recall the winey stench of the old man\u2019s breath.\n\u201cDead these five years, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of Maester Qalen, where is he?\u201d\n\u201cHe sleeps in the sea. Wendamyr keeps the ravens now.\u201d\nIt is as if I were a stranger here, Theon thought. Nothing has changed, and yet everything has changed. \u201cShow me to my chambers, woman,\u201d he commanded. Bowing stiffly, she led him across the headland to the bridge. That at least was as he remembered; the ancient stones slick with spray and spotted by lichen, the sea foaming under their feet like some great wild beast, the salt wind clutching at their clothes.\nWhenever he\u2019d imagined his homecoming, he had always pictured himself returning to the snug bedchamber in the Sea Tower, where he\u2019d slept as a child. Instead the old woman led him to the Bloody Keep. The halls here were larger and better furnished, if no less cold nor damp. Theon was given a suite of chilly rooms with ceilings so high that they were lost in gloom. He might have been more impressed if he had not known that these were the very chambers that had given the Bloody Keep its name. A thousand years before, the sons of the River King had been slaughtered here, hacked to bits in their beds so that pieces of their bodies might be sent back to their father on the mainland.\nBut Greyjoys were not murdered in Pyke except once in a great while by their brothers, and his brothers were both dead. It was not fear of ghosts that made him glance about with distaste. The wall hangings were green with mildew, the mattress musty-smelling and sagging, the rushes old and brittle. Years had come and gone since these chambers had last been opened. The damp went bone deep. \u201cI\u2019ll have a basin of hot water and a fire in this hearth,\u201d he told the crone. \u201cSee that they light braziers in the other rooms to drive out some of the chill. And gods be good, get someone in here at once to change these rushes.\u201d\n\u201cYes, m\u2019lord. As you command.\u201d She fled.\nAfter some time, they brought the hot water he had asked for. It was only tepid, and soon cold, and seawater in the bargain, but it served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face and hair and hands. While two thralls lit his braziers, Theon stripped off his travel-stained clothing and dressed to meet his father. He chose boots of supple black leather, soft lambswool breeches of silvery-grey, a black velvet doublet with the golden kraken of the Greyjoys embroidered on the breast. Around his throat he fastened a slender gold chain, around his waist a belt of bleached white leather. He hung a dirk at one hip and a longsword at the other, in scabbards striped black-and-gold. Drawing the dirk, he tested its edge with his thumb, pulled a whetstone from his belt pouch, and gave it a few licks. He prided himself on keeping his weapons sharp. \u201cWhen I return, I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes,\u201d he warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves, the silk decorated with a delicate scrollwork tracery in golden thread.\nTheon returned to the Great Keep through a covered stone walkway, the echoes of his footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below. To get to the Sea Tower on its crooked pillar, he had to cross three further bridges, each narrower than the one before. The last was made of rope and wood, and the wet salt wind made it sway underfoot like a living thing. Theon\u2019s heart was in his mouth by the time he was halfway across. A long way below, the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as they crashed against the rock. As a boy, he used to run across this bridge, even in the black of night. Boys believe nothing can hurt them, his doubt whispered. Grown men know better.\nThe door was grey wood studded with iron, and Theon found it barred from the inside. He hammered on it with a fist, and cursed when a splinter snagged the fabric of his glove. The wood was damp and moldy, the iron studs rusted.\nAfter a moment the door was opened from within by a guard in a black iron breastplate and pothelm. \u201cYou are the son?\u201d\n\u201cOut of my way, or you\u2019ll learn who I am.\u201d The man stood aside. Theon climbed the twisting steps to the solar. He found his father seated beside a brazier, beneath a robe of musty sealskins that covered him foot to chin. At the sound of boots on stone, the Lord of the Iron Islands lifted his eyes to behold his last living son. He was smaller than Theon remembered him. And so gaunt. Balon Greyjoy had always been thin, but now he looked as though the gods had put him in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from his bones, until nothing remained but hair and skin. Bone thin and bone hard he was, with a face that might have been chipped from flint. His eyes were flinty too, black and sharp, but the years and the salt winds had turned his hair the grey of a winter sea, flecked with whitecaps. Unbound, it hung past the small of the back.\n\u201cNine years, is it?\u201d Lord Balon said at last.\n\u201cTen,\u201d Theon answered, pulling off his torn gloves.\n\u201cA boy they took,\u201d his father said. \u201cWhat are you now?\u201d\n\u201cA man,\u201d Theon answered. \u201cYour blood and your heir.\u201d\nLord Balon grunted. \u201cWe shall see.\u201d\n\u201cYou shall,\u201d Theon promised.\n\u201cTen years, you say. Stark had you as long as I. And now you come as his envoy.\u201d\n\u201cNot his,\u201d Theon said. \u201cLord Eddard is dead, beheaded by the Lannister queen.\u201d\n\u201cThey are both dead, Stark and that Robert who broke my walls with his stones. I vowed I\u2019d live to see them both in their graves, and I have.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cYet the cold and the damp still make my joints ache, as when they were alive. So what does it serve?\u201d\n\u201cIt serves.\u201d Theon moved closer. \u201cI bring a letter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid Ned Stark dress you like that?\u201d his father interrupted, squinting up from beneath his robe. \u201cWas it his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet daughter?\u201d\nTheon felt the blood rising to his face. \u201cI am no man\u2019s daughter. If you mislike my garb, I will change it.\u201d\n\u201cYou will.\u201d Throwing off the furs, Lord Balon pushed himself to his feet. He was not so tall as Theon remembered. \u201cThat bauble around your neck\u2014was it bought with gold or iron?\u201d\nTheon touched the gold chain. He had forgotten. It has been so long\u2026 In the Old Way, women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin, but a warrior wore only the jewelry he took off the corpses of enemies slain by his own hand. Paying the iron price, it was called.\n\u201cYou blush red as a maid, Theon. A question was asked. Is it the gold price you paid, or the iron?\u201d\n\u201cThe gold,\u201d Theon admitted.\nHis father slid his fingers under the necklace and gave it a yank so hard it was like to take Theon\u2019s head off, had the chain not snapped first. \u201cMy daughter has taken an axe for a lover,\u201d Lord Balon said. \u201cI will not have my son bedeck himself like a whore.\u201d He dropped the broken chain onto the brazier, where it slid down among the coals. \u201cIt is as I feared. The green lands have made you soft, and the Starks have made you theirs. \u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Ned Stark was my gaoler, but my blood is still salt and iron.\u201d\nLord Balon turned away to warm his bony hands over the brazier. \u201cYet the Stark pup sends you to me like a well-trained raven, clutching his little message.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing small about the letter I bear,\u201d Theon said, \u201cand the offer he makes is one I suggested to him.\u201d\n\u201cThis wolf king heeds your counsel, does he?\u201d The notion seemed to amuse Lord Balon.\n\u201cHe heeds me, yes. I\u2019ve hunted with him, trained with him, shared meat and mead with him, warred at his side. I have earned his trust. He looks on me as an older brother, he\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d His father jabbed a finger at his face. \u201cNot here, not in Pyke, not in my hearing, you will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten Rodrik and Maron, who were your own blood?\u201d\n\u201cI forget nothing.\u201d Ned Stark had killed neither of his brothers, in truth. Rodrik had been slain by Lord Jason Mallister at Seagard, Maron crushed in the collapse of the old south tower\u2026 but Stark would have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to sweep them together. \u201cI remember my brothers very well,\u201d Theon insisted. Chiefly he remembered Rodrik\u2019s drunken cuffs and Maron\u2019s cruel japes and endless lies. \u201cI remember when my father was a king too.\u201d He took out Robb\u2019s letter and thrust it forward. \u201cHere. Read it\u2026 Your Grace.\u201d\nLord Balon broke the seal and unfolded the parchment. His black eyes flicked back and forth. \u201cSo the boy would give me a crown again,\u201d he said, \u201cand all I need do is destroy his enemies.\u201d His thin lips twisted in a smile.\n\u201cBy now Robb is at the Golden Tooth,\u201d Theon said. \u201cOnce it falls, he\u2019ll be through the hills in a day. Lord Tywin\u2019s host is at Harrenhal, cut off from the west. The Kingslayer is a captive at Riverrun. Only Ser Stafford Lannister and the raw green levies he\u2019s been gathering remain to oppose Robb in the west. Ser Stafford will put himself between Robb\u2019s army and Lannisport, which means the city will be undefended when we descend on it by sea. If the gods are with us, even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the Lannisters so much as realize that we are upon them.\u201d\nLord Balon grunted. \u201cCasterly Rock has never fallen.\u201d\n\u201cUntil now.\u201d Theon smiled. And how sweet that will be.\nHis father did not return the smile. \u201cSo this is why Robb Stark sends you back to me, after so long? So you might win my consent to this plan of his?\u201d\n\u201cIt is my plan, not Robb\u2019s,\u201d Theon said proudly. Mine, as the victory will be mine, and in time the crown. \u201cI will lead the attack myself, if it please you. As my reward I would ask that you grant me Casterly Rock for my own seat, once we have taken it from the Lannisters.\u201d With the Rock, he could hold Lannisport and the golden lands of the west. It would mean wealth and power such as House Greyjoy had never known.\n\u201cYou reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling.\u201d His father read the letter again. \u201cThe pup says nothing about a reward. Only that you speak for him, and I am to listen, and give him my sails and swords, and in return he will give me a crown.\u201d His flinty eyes lifted to meet his son\u2019s. \u201cHe will give me a crown,\u201d he repeated, his voice growing sharp.\n\u201cA poor choice of words, what is meant is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat is meant is what is said. The boy will give me a crown. And what is given can be taken away.\u201d Lord Balon tossed the letter onto the brazier, atop the necklace. The parchment curled, blackened, and took flame.\nTheon was aghast. \u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d\nHis father laid a stinging backhand across his cheek. \u201cMind your tongue. You are not in Winterfell now, and I am not Robb the Boy, that you should speak to me so. I am the Greyjoy, Lord Reaper of Pyke, King of Salt and Rock, Son of the Sea Wind, and no man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown, as Urron Redhand did five thousand years ago.\u201d\nTheon edged backward, away from the sudden fury in his father\u2019s tone. \u201cTake it, then,\u201d he spat, his cheek still tingling. \u201cCall yourself King of the Iron islands, no one will care\u2026 until the wars are over, and the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off his shore with an iron crown on his head.\u201d\nLord Balon laughed. \u201cWell, at the least you are no craven. No more than I\u2019m a fool. Do you think I gather my ships to watch them rock at anchor? I mean to carve out a kingdom with fire and sword\u2026 but not from the west, and not at the bidding of King Robb the Boy. Casterly Rock is too strong, and Lord Tywin too cunning by half. Aye, we might take Lannisport, but we should never keep it. No. I hunger for a different plum\u2026 not so juicy sweet, to be sure, yet it hangs there ripe and undefended.\u201d\nWhere? Theon might have asked, but by then he knew.",

      "content": "Daenerys\nThe Dothraki named the comet shierak qiya, the Bleeding Star. The old men muttered that it omened ill, but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned Khal Drogo, the night her dragons had awakened. It is the herald of my coming, she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart. The gods have sent it to show me the way.\nYet when she put the thought into words, her handmaid Doreah quailed. \u201cThat way lies the red lands, Khaleesi. A grim place and terrible, the riders say.\u201d\n\u201cThe way the comet points is the way we must go,\u201d Dany insisted\u2026 though in truth, it was the only way open to her.\nShe dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the Dothraki sea. The first khalasar they met would swallow up her ragged band, slaying the warriors and slaving the rest. The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to them. They were too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk, and the Lhazareen had small reason to love them. She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai and Astapor, but Rakharo warned her that Pono\u2019s khalasar had ridden that way, driving thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of Slaver\u2019s Bay. \u201cWhy should I fear Pono?\u201d Dany objected. \u201cHe was Drogo\u2019s ko, and always spoke me gently.\u201d\n\u201cKo Pono spoke you gently,\u201d Ser Jorah Mormont said. \u201cKhal Pono will kill you. He was the first to abandon Drogo. Ten thousand warriors went with him. You have a hundred.\u201d\nNo, Dany thought. I have four. The rest are women, old sick men and boys whose hair has never been braided. \u201cI have the dragons,\u201d she pointed out.\n\u201cHatchlings,\u201d Ser Jorah said. \u201cOne swipe from an arakh would put an end to them, though Porto is more like to seize them for himself. Your dragon eggs were more precious than rubies. A living dragon is beyond price. In all the world, there are only three. Every man who sees them will want them, my queen.\u201d\n\u201cThey are mine,\u201d she said fiercely. They had been born from her faith and her need, given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the maegi Mirri Maz Duur. Dany had walked into the flames as they came forth, and they had drunk milk from her swollen breasts. \u201cNo man will take them from me while I live.\u201d\n\u201cYou will not live long should you meet Khal Pono. Nor Khal Jhaqo, nor any of the others. You must go where they do not.\u201d\nDany had named him the first of her Queensguard\u2026 and when Mormont\u2019s gruff counsel and the omens agreed, her course was clear. She called her people together and mounted her silver mare. Her hair had burned away in Drogo\u2019s pyre, so her handmaids garbed her in the skin of the hrakkar Drogo had slain, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. Its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp, its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back. The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion\u2019s mane and coiled its tail around her arm, while Ser Jorah took his accustomed place by her side.\n\u201cWe follow the comet,\u201d Dany told her khalasar. Once it was said, no word was raised against it. They had been Drogo\u2019s people, but they were hers now. The Unburnt, they called her, and Mother of Dragons. Her word was their law.\nThey rode by night, and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents. Soon enough Dany learned the truth of Doreah\u2019s words. This was no kindly country. They left a trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went, for Pono, Jhaqo, and the others had seized the best of Drogo\u2019s herds, leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny, the sickly and the lame, the broken animals and the ill-tempered. It was the same with the people. They are not strong, she told herself, so I must be their strength. I must show no fear, no weakness, no doubt. However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo\u2019s queen. She felt older than her fourteen years. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done.\nThree days into the march, the first man died. A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living. \u201cHis time was past,\u201d her handmaid Irri declared. \u201cNo man should live longer than his teeth.\u201d The others agreed. Dany bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands.\nTwo nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her mother\u2019s anguished wailing lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. The child had been too young to ride, poor thing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born again.\nThere was little forage in the red waste, and less water. It was a sere and desolate land of low hills and barren windswept plains. The rivers they crossed were dry as dead men\u2019s bones. Their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks and dead trees. Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column, but they found neither wells nor springs, only bitter pools, shallow and stagnant, shrinking in the hot sun. The deeper they rode into the waste, the smaller the pools became, while the distance between them grew. If there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay, they were hard dry gods, deaf to prayers for rain.\nWine gave out first, and soon thereafter the clotted mare\u2019s milk the horselords loved better than mead. Then their stores of flatbread and dried meat were exhausted as well. Their hunters found no game, and only the flesh of their dead horses filled their bellies. Death followed death. Weak children, wrinkled old women, the sick and the stupid and the heedless, the cruel land claimed them all. Doreah grew gaunt and hollow-eyed, and her soft golden hair turned brittle as straw.\nDany hungered and thirsted with the rest of them. The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples cracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for. Her father had been slain before she was born, and her splendid brother Rhaegar as well. Her mother had died bringing her into the world while the storm screamed outside. Gentle Ser Willem Darry, who must have loved her after a fashion, had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young. Her brother Viserys, Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars, even her unborn son, the gods had claimed them all. They will not have my dragons, Dany vowed. They will not.\nThe dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the walls of Magister Illyrio\u2019s estate in Pentos\u2026 until they unfolded their wings. Their span was three times their length, each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin, gorgeously colored, stretched taut between long thin bones. When you looked hard, you could see that most of their body was neck, tail, and wing. Such little things, she thought as she fed them by hand. or rather, tried to feed them, for the dragons would not eat. They would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising from their nostrils, yet they would not take the food\u2026 until Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were children.\nOnly dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.\nWhen she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes. So long as the meat was seared, they gulped down several times their own weight every day, and at last began to grow larger and stronger. Dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales, and the heat that poured off them, so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam.\nEach evenfall as the khalasar set out, she would choose a dragon to ride upon her shoulder. Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their mounts, and rode close behind her, so Dany was never out of their sight. It was the only way to keep them quiescent.\n\u201cAegon\u2019s dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria,\u201d she told her bloodriders one morning after a long night\u2019s journey. \u201cVisenya\u2019s dragon was Vhagar, Rhaenys had Meraxes, and Aegon rode Balerion, the Black Dread. It was said that Vhagar\u2019s breath was so hot that it could melt a knight\u2019s armor and cook the man inside, that Meraxes swallowed horses whole, and Balerion\u2026 his fire was as black as his scales, his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead.\u201d\nThe Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily. The largest of her three was shiny black, his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns. \u201cKhaleesi,\u201d Aggo murmured, \u201cthere sits Balerion, come again.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be as you say, blood of my blood,\u201d Dany replied gravely, \u201cbut he shall have a new name for this new life. I would name them all for those the gods have taken. The green one shall be Rhaegal, for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the Trident. The cream-and-gold I call Viserion. Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my brother still. His dragon will do what he could not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the black beast?\u201d asked Ser Jorah Mormont.\n\u201cThe black,\u201d she said, \u201cis Drogon.\u201d\nYet even as her dragons prospered, her khalasar withered and died. Around them the land turned ever more desolate. Even devilgrass grew scant; horses dropped in their tracks, leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot. Doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. She gave Doreah water from her own skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died, shivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.\nThey saw no sign of other travelers. The Dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the comet had led them to some hell. Dany went to Ser Jorah one morning as they made camp amidst a jumble of black windscoured stones. \u201cAre we lost?\u201d she asked him. \u201cDoes this waste have no end to it?\u201d\n\u201cIt has an end,\u201d he answered wearily. \u201cI have seen the maps the traders draw, my queen. Few caravans come this way, that is so, yet there are great kingdoms to the east, and cities full of wonders. Yi Ti, Qarth, Asshai by the Shadow\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWill we live to see them?\u201d\n\u201cI will not lie to you. The way is harder than I dared think.\u201d The knight\u2019s face was grey and exhausted. The wound he had taken to his hip the night he fought Khal Drogo\u2019s bloodriders had never fully healed; she could see how he grimaced when he mounted his horse, and he seemed to slump in his saddle as they rode. \u201cPerhaps we are doomed if we press on\u2026 but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back.\u201d\nDany kissed him lightly on the cheek. It heartened her to see him smile. I must be strong for him as well, she thought grimly. A knight he may be, but I am the blood of the dragon.\nThe next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone, but their skins were almost empty. The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid. The taste was no less foul, but water was water, and all of them thirsted. Dany looked at the horizon with despair. They had lost a third of their number, and still the waste stretched before them, bleak and red and endless. The comet mocks my hopes, she thought, lifting her eyes to where it scored the sky. Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with them in this hard hot desert? She would not believe it.\nThe next day, dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth. Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop. \u201cA city, Khaleesi,\u201d they cried. \u201cA city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid. An hour\u2019s ride, no more.\u201d\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she said.\nWhen the city appeared before her, its walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil of heat, it looked so beautiful that Dany was certain it must be a mirage. \u201cDo you know what place this might be? Ser Jorah.\u201d\nThe exile knight gave a weary shake of the head. \u201cNo, my queen. I have never traveled this far east.\u201d\nThe distant white walls promised rest and safety, a chance to heal and grow strong, and Dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward them. Instead she turned to her bloodriders. \u201cBlood of my blood, go ahead of us and learn the name of this city, and what manner of welcome we should expect.\u201d\n\u201cAi, Khaleesi,\u201d said Aggo.\nHer riders were not long in returning. Rakharo swung down from his saddle. From his medallion belt hung the great curving arakh that Dany had bestowed on him when she named him bloodrider. \u201cThis city is dead, Khaleesi. Nameless and godless we found it, the gates broken, only wind and flies moving through the streets.\u201d\nJhiqui shuddered. \u201cWhen the gods are gone, the evil ghosts feast by night. Such places are best shunned. It is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d Irri agreed.\n\u201cNot to me.\u201d Dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way, trotting beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street. Ser Jorah and her bloodriders followed, and then, more slowly, the rest of the Dothraki.\nHow long the city had been deserted she could not know, but the white walls, so beautiful from afar, were cracked and crumbling when seen up close. Inside was a maze of narrow crooked alleys. The buildings pressed close, their facades blank, chalky, windowless. Everything was white, as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color. They rode past heaps of sun-washed rubble where houses had fallen in, and elsewhere saw the faded scars of fire. At a place where six alleys came together, Dany passed an empty marble plinth. Dothraki had visited this place before, it would seem. Perhaps even now the missing statue stood among the other stolen gods in Vaes Dothrak. She might have ridden past it a hundred times, never knowing. On her shoulder, Viserion hissed.\nThey made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace, on a windswept plaza where devilgrass grew between the paving stones. Dany sent out men to search the ruins. Some went reluctantly, yet they went\u2026 and one scarred old man returned a brief time later, hopping and grinning, his hands overflowing with figs. They were small, withered things, yet her people grabbed for them greedily, jostling and pushing at each other, stuffing the fruit into their cheeks and chewing blissfully.\nOther searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees, hidden behind closed doors in secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones too, the skulls of the unburied dead, bleached and broken. \u201cGhosts,\u201d Irri muttered. \u201cTerrible ghosts. We must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their place.\u201d\n\u201cI fear no ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than ghosts.\u201d And figs are more important. \u201cGo with Jhiqui and find me some clean sand for a bath, and trouble me no more with silly talk.\u201d\nIn the coolness of her tent, Dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her choices. There was food and water here to sustain them, and enough grass for the horses to regain their strength. How pleasant it would be to wake every day in the same place, to linger among shady gardens, eat figs, and drink cool water, as much as she might desire.\nWhen Irri and Jhiqui returned with pots of white sand, Dany stripped and let them scrub her clean. \u201cYour hair is coming back, Khaleesi,\u201d Jhiqui said as she scraped sand off her back. Dany ran a hand over the top of her head, feeling the new growth. Dothraki men wore their hair in long oiled braids, and cut them only when defeated. Perhaps I should do the same, she thought, to remind them that Drogo\u2019s strength lives within me now. Khal Drogo had died with his hair uncut, a boast few men could make.\nAcross the tent, Rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half foot before thumping to the carpet. When he landed, his tail lashed back and forth in fury, and he raised his head and screamed. If I had wings, I would want to fly too, Dany thought. The Targaryens of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war. She tried to imagine what it would feel like, to straddle a dragon\u2019s neck and soar high into the air. It would be like standing on a mountaintop, only better. The whole world would be spread out below If I flew high enough, I could even see the Seven Kingdoms, and reach up and touch the comet.\nIrri broke her reverie to tell her that Ser Jorah Mormont was outside, awaiting her pleasure. \u201cSend him in,\u201d Dany commanded, sand-scrubbed skin tingling. She wrapped herself in the lionskin. The hrakkar had been much bigger than Dany, so the pelt covered everything that wanted covering.\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought you a peach,\u201d Ser Jorah said, kneeling. It was so small she could almost hide it in her palm, and overripe too, but when she took the first bite, the flesh was so sweet she almost cried. She ate it slowly, savoring every mouthful, while Ser Jorah told her of the tree it had been plucked from, in a garden near the western wall.\n\u201cFruit and water and shade,\u201d Dany said, her cheeks sticky with peach juice. \u201cThe gods were good to bring us to this place.\u201d\n\u201cWe should rest here until we are stronger,\u201d the knight urged. \u201cThe red lands are not kind to the weak.\u201d\n\u201cMy handmaids say there are ghosts here.\u201d\n\u201cThere are ghosts everywhere,\u201d Ser Jorah said softly. \u201cWe carry them with us wherever we go.\u201d\nYes, she thought. Viserys, Khal Drogo, my son Rhaego, they are with me always. \u201cTell me the name of your ghost, Jorah. You know all of mine.\u201d\nHis face grew very still. \u201cHer name was Lynesse.\u201d\n\u201cYour wife?\u201d\n\u201cMy second wife.\u201d\nIt pains him to speak of her, Dany saw, but she wanted to know the truth. \u201cIs that all you would say of her?\u201d The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place. \u201cWas she beautiful?\u201d\n\u201cVery beautiful.\u201d Ser Jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face. \u201cThe first time I beheld her, I thought she was a goddess come to earth, the Maid herself made flesh. Her birth was far above my own. She was the youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower of Oldtown. The White Bull who commanded your father\u2019s Kingsguard was her great-uncle. The Hightowers are an ancient family, very rich and very proud.\u201d\n\u201cAnd loyal,\u201d Dany said. \u201cI remember, Viserys said the Hightowers were among those who stayed true to my father.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cDid your fathers make the match?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cOur marriage\u2026 that makes a long tale and a dull one, Your Grace. I would not trouble you with it.\u201d\n\u201cI have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cAs my queen commands.\u201d Ser Jorah frowned. \u201cMy home\u2026 you must understand that to understand the rest. Bear Island is beautiful, but remote. Imagine old gnarled oaks and tall pines, flowering thornbushes, grey stones bearded with moss, little creeks running icy down steep hillsides. The hall of the Mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen palisade. Aside from a few crofters, my people live along the coasts and fish the seas. The island lies far to the north, and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine, Khaleesi.\n\u201cStill, the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women. I had my share of fishwives and crofter\u2019s daughters, before and after I was wed. I married young, to a bride of my father\u2019s choosing, a Glover of Deepwood Motte. Ten years we were wed, or near enough as makes no matter. She was a plain-faced woman, but not unkind. I suppose I came to love her after a fashion, though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate. Three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir. The last time she never recovered. She died not long after.\u201d\nDany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze. \u201cI am sorry for you, truly.\u201d\nSer Jorah nodded. \u201cBy then my father had taken the black, so I was Lord of Bear Island in my own right. I had no lack of marriage offers, but before I could reach a decision Lord Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper, and Ned Stark called his banners to help his friend Robert. The final battle was on Pyke. When Robert\u2019s stonethrowers opened a breach in King Balon\u2019s wall, a priest from Myr was the first man through, but I was not far behind. For that I won my knighthood.\n\u201cTo celebrate his victory, Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport. It was there I saw Lynesse, a maid half my age. She had come up from Oldtown with her father to see her brothers joust. I could not take my eyes off her. In a fit of madness, I begged her favor to wear in the tourney, never dreaming she would grant my request, yet she did.\n\u201cI fight as well as any man, Khaleesi, but I have never been a tourney knight. Yet with Lynesse\u2019s favor knotted round my arm, I was a different man. I won joust after joust. Lord Jason Mallister fell before me, and Bronze Yohn Royce. Ser Ryman Frey, his brother Ser Hosteen, Lord Whent, Strongboar, even Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard, I unhorsed them all. In the last match, I broke nine lances against Jaime Lannister to no result, and King Robert gave me the champion\u2019s laurel. I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty, and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand. I was drunk, as much on glory as on wine. By rights I should have gotten a contemptuous refusal, but Lord Leyton accepted my offer. We were married there in Lannisport, and for a fortnight I was the happiest man in the wide world.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a fortnight?\u201d asked Dany. Even I was given more happiness than that, with Drogo who was my sun-and-stars.\n\u201cA fortnight was how long it took us to sail from Lannisport back to Bear Island. My home was a great disappointment to Lynesse. It was too cold, too damp, too far away, my castle no more than a wooden longhall. We had no masques, no mummer shows, no balls or fairs. Seasons might pass without a singer ever coming to play for us, and there\u2019s not a goldsmith on the island. Even meals became a trial. My cook knew little beyond his roasts and stews, and Lynesse soon lost her taste for fish and venison.\n\u201cI lived for her smiles, so I sent all the way to Oldtown for a new cook, and brought a harper from Lannisport. Goldsmiths, jewelers, dressmakers, whatever she wanted I found for her, but it was never enough. Bear Island is rich in bears and trees, and poor in aught else. I built a fine ship for her and we sailed to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs, and once even to Braavos, where I borrowed heavily from the money-lenders. It was as a tourney champion that I had won her hand and heart, so I entered other tourneys for her sake, but the magic was gone. I never distinguished myself again, and each defeat meant the loss of another charger and another suit of jousting armor, which must needs be ransomed or replaced. The cost could not be borne. Finally I insisted we return home, but there matters soon grew even worse than before. I could no longer pay the cook and the harper, and Lynesse grew wild when I spoke of pawning her jewels.\n\u201cThe rest\u2026 I did things it shames me to speak of. For gold. So Lynesse might keep her jewels, her harper, and her cook. In the end it cost me all. When I heard that Eddard Stark was coming to Bear Island, I was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face his judgment, I took her with me into exile. Nothing mattered but our love, I told myself. We fled to Lys, where I sold my ship for gold to keep us.\u201d\nHis voice was thick with grief, and Dany was reluctant to press him any further, yet she had to know how it ended. \u201cDid she die there?\u201d she asked him gently.\n\u201cOnly to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn half a year my gold was gone, and I was obliged to take service as a sellsword. While I was fighting Braavosi on the Rhoyne, Lynesse moved into the manse of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen. They say she is his chief concubine now, and even his wife goes in fear of her.\u201d\nDany was horrified. \u201cDo you hate her?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost as much as I love her,\u201d Ser Jorah answered. \u201cPray excuse me, my queen. I find I am very tired.\u201d\nShe gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question. \u201cWhat did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?\u201d\nSer Jorah smiled sadly. \u201cWhy, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys.\u201d He bowed low. \u201cSleep well, my queen.\u201d\nDany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. She looked like me. It explained much that she had not truly understood. He wants me, she realized. He loves me as he loved her, not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman. She tried to imagine herself in Ser Jorah\u2019s arms, kissing him, pleasuring him, letting him enter her. It was no good. When she closed her eyes, his face kept changing into Drogo\u2019s.\nKhal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars, her first, and perhaps he must be her last. The maegi Mirri Maz Duur had sworn she should never bear a living child, and what man would want a barren wife? And what man could hope to rival Drogo, who had died with his hair uncut and rode now through the night lands, the stars his khalasar?\nShe had heard the longing in Ser Jorah\u2019s voice when he spoke of his Bear Island. He can never have me, but one day I can give him back his home and honor. That much I can do for him.\nNo ghosts troubled her sleep that night. She dreamed of Drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were wed. In the dream it was not horses they rode, but dragons.\nThe next morn, she summoned her bloodriders. \u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d she told the three of them, \u201cI have need of you. Each of you is to choose three horses, the hardiest and healthiest that remain to us. Load as much water and food as your mounts can bear, and ride forth for me. Aggo shall strike southwest, Rakharo due south. Jhogo, you are to follow shierak qiya on southeast.\u201d\n\u201cWhat shall we seek, Khaleesi?\u201d asked Jhogo.\n\u201cWhatever there is,\u201d Dany answered. \u201cSeek for other cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for rivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. When I leave this place, I do not mean to strike out blind again. I will know where I am bound, and how best to get there.\u201d\nAnd so they went, the bells in their hair ringing softly, while Dany settled down with her small band of survivors in the place they named Vaes Tolorro, the city of bones. Day followed night followed day. Women harvested fruit from the gardens of the dead. Men groomed their mounts and mended saddles, stirrups, and shoes. Children wandered the twisty alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and stone flagons with handles carved like snakes. One woman was stung by a red scorpion, but hers was the only death. The horses began to put on some flesh. Dany tended Ser Jorah\u2019s wound herself, and it began to heal.\nRakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns. He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws. Other than that, he had seen nothing.\nDany gave him charge of a dozen of her strongest men, and set them to pulling up the plaza to get to the earth beneath. If devilgrass could grow between the paving stones, other grasses would grow when the stones were gone. They had wells enough, no lack of water. Given seed, they could make the plaza bloom.\nAggo was back next. The southwest was barren and burnt, he swore. He had found the ruins of two more cities, smaller than Vaes Tolorro but otherwise the same. One was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears, so he dared not enter, but he had explored the second for as long as he could. He showed Dany an iron bracelet he had found, set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb. There were scrolls as well, but they were dry and crumbling and Aggo had left them where they lay.\nDany thanked him and told him to see to the repair of the gates. If enemies had crossed the waste to destroy these cities in ancient days, they might well come again. \u201cIf so, we must be ready,\u201d she declared.\nJhogo was gone so long that Dany feared him lost, but finally when they had all but ceased to look for him, he came riding up from the southeast. One of the guards that Aggo had posted saw him first and gave a shout, and Dany rushed to the walls to see for herself. It was true. Jhogo came, yet not alone. Behind him rode three queerly garbed strangers atop ugly humped creatures that dwarfed any horse.\nThey drew rein before the city gates, and looked up to see Dany on the wall above them. \u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d Jhogo called, \u201cI have been to the great city Qarth, and returned with three who would look on you with their own eyes.\u201d\nDany stared down at the strangers. \u201cHere I stand. Look, if that is your pleasure\u2026 but first tell me your names.\u201d\nThe pale man with the blue lips replied in guttural Dothraki, \u201cI am Pyat Pree, the great warlock.\u201d\nThe bald man with the jewels in his nose answered in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, \u201cI am Xaro Xhoan Daxos of the Thirteen, a merchant prince of Qarth.\u201d\nThe woman in the lacquered wooden mask said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms, \u201cI am Quaithe of the Shadow. We come seeking dragons.\u201d\n\u201cSeek no more,\u201d Daenerys Targaryen told them. \u201cYou have found them.\u201d",

      "content": "Jon\nWhitetree, the village was named on Sam\u2019s old maps. Jon did not think it much of a village. Four tumbledown one-room houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty sheepfold and a well. The houses were roofed with sod, the windows shuttered with ragged pieces of hide. And above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous great weirwood.\nIt was the biggest tree Jon Snow had ever seen, the trunk near eight feet wide, the branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath their canopy. The size did not disturb him so much as the face\u2026 the mouth especially, no simple carved slash, but a jagged hollow large enough to swallow a sheep.\nThose are not sheep bones, though. Nor is that a sheep\u2019s skull in the ashes.\n\u201cAn old tree.\u201d Mormont sat his horse, frowning. \u201cOld,\u201d his raven agreed from his shoulder. \u201cOld, old, old.\u201d\n\u201cAnd powerful.\u201d Jon could feel the power.\nThoren Smallwood dismounted beside the trunk, dark in his plate and mail. \u201cLook at that face. Small wonder men feared them, when they first came to Westeros. I\u2019d like to take an axe to the bloody thing myself.\u201d\nJon said, \u201cMy lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree. The old gods know when men are lying.\u201d\n\u201cMy father believed the same,\u201d said the Old Bear. \u201cLet me have a look at that skull.\u201d\nJon dismounted. Slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was Longclaw, the hand-and-a-half bastard blade the Old Bear had given him for saving his life. A bastard sword for a bastard, the men joked. The hilt had been fashioned new for him, adorned with a wolf\u2019s-head pommel in pale stone, but the blade itself was Valyrian steel, old and light and deadly sharp.\nHe knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw. The inside of the hollow was red with dried sap and blackened by fire. Beneath the skull he saw another, smaller, the jaw broken off. It was half-buried in ash and bits of bone.\nWhen he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets. \u201cThe wildlings burn their dead. We\u2019ve always known that. Now I wished I\u2019d asked them why, when there were still a few around to ask.\u201d\nJon Snow remembered the wight rising, its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face. He knew why, he was certain.\n\u201cWould that bones could talk,\u201d the Old Bear grumbled. \u201cThis fellow could tell us much. How he died. Who burned him, and why. Where the wildlings have gone.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe children of the forest could speak to the dead, it\u2019s said. But I can\u2019t.\u201d He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash. \u201cGo through all these houses. Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look. I\u2019ll have the hounds brought up too. Perchance this time the trail will be fresher.\u201d His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last.\nTwo men went through each house, to make certain nothing was missed. Jon was paired with dour Eddison Tollett, a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike, whom the other brothers called Dolorous Edd. \u201cBad enough when the dead come walking,\u201d he said to Jon as they crossed the village, \u201cnow the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will come of that, I\u2019ll warrant. And who\u2019s to say the bones wouldn\u2019t lie? Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints\u2014the ground\u2019s too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do\u2026\u201d\nJon had to stoop to pass through the low door. Within he found a packed dirt floor. There were no furnishings, no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof. \u201cWhat a dismal place to live,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was born in a house much like this,\u201d declared Dolorous Edd. \u201cThose were my enchanted years. Later I fell on hard times.\u201d A nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of the room. Edd looked at it with longing. \u201cI\u2019d give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a bed again.\u201d\n\u201cYou call that a bed?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed.\u201d Dolorous Edd sniffed the air. \u201cI smell dung.\u201d\nThe smell was very faint. \u201cOld dung,\u201d said Jon. The house felt as though it had been empty for some time. Kneeling, he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath, then made a round of the walls. It did not take very long. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here.\u201d\nNothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and it had been the same in all of them. The people were gone, vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had. None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked. They were simply\u2026 empty. \u201cWhat do you think happened to them all?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cSomething worse than we can imagine,\u201d suggested Dolorous Edd. \u201cWell, I might be able to imagine it, but I\u2019d sooner not. Bad enough to know you\u2019re going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime.\u201d\nTwo of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged. Other dogs ranged through the village. Chett was cursing them loudly, his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside. The light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils on his face look even more inflamed than usual. When he saw Jon his eyes narrowed; there was no love lost between them.\nThe other houses had yielded no wisdom. \u201cGone,\u201d cried Mormont\u2019s raven, flapping up into the weirwood to perch above them. \u201cGone, gone, gone.\u201d\n\u201cThere were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago.\u201d Thoren Smallwood looked more a lord than Mormont did, clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker\u2019s gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate. His heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable, and clasped with the crossed hammers of the Rykkers, wrought in silver. Ser Jaremy\u2019s cloak, once\u2026 but the wight had claimed Ser Jaremy, and the Night\u2019s Watch wasted nothing.\n\u201cA year ago Robert was king, and the realm was at peace,\u201d declared Jarman Buckwell, the square stolid man who commanded the scouts. \u201cMuch can change in a year\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Ser Mallador Locke insisted. \u201cFewer wildlings means fewer worries. I won\u2019t mourn, whatever\u2019s become of them. Raiders and murderers, the lot of them.\u201d\nJon heard a rustling from the red leaves above. Two branches parted, and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel. Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall, but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age. The other rangers called him Giant. He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said, \u201cThere\u2019s water to the north. A lake, might be. A few flint hills rising to the west, not very high. Nothing else to see, my lords.\u201d\n\u201cWe might camp here tonight,\u201d Smallwood suggested.\nThe Old Bear glanced up, searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood. \u201cNo,\u201d he declared. \u201cGiant, how much daylight remains to us?\u201d\n\u201cThree hours, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll press on north,\u201d Mormont decided. \u201cIf we reach this lake, we can make camp by the shore, perchance catch a few fish. Jon, fetch me paper, it\u2019s past time I wrote Maester Aemon.\u201d\nJon found parchment, quill, and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the Lord Commander. At Whitetree, Mormont scrawled. The fourth village. All empty. The wildlings are gone. \u201cFind Tarly and see that he gets this on its way,\u201d he said as he handed Jon the message. When he whistled, his raven came flapping down to land on his horse\u2019s head. \u201cCorn,\u201d the raven suggested, bobbing. The horse whickered.\nJon mounted his garron, wheeled him about, and trotted off. Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night\u2019s Watch stood beneath lesser trees, tending their horses, chewing strips of salt beef, pissing, scratching, and talking. When the command was given to move out again, the talk died, and they climbed back into their saddles. Jarman Buckwell\u2019s scouts rode out first, with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper. Then came the Old Bear with the main force, Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and packhorses, and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard. Two hundred men all told, with half again as many mounts.\nBy day they followed game trails and streambeds, the \u201cranger\u2019s roads\u201d that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root. At night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet. The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits, joking and trading tales, but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all. Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter. No one would admit to being afraid\u2014they were men of the Night\u2019s Watch, after all\u2014but Jon could feel the unease. Four empty villages, no wildlings anywhere, even the game seemingly fled. The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted, even veteran rangers agreed.\nAs he rode, Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers. Ugly things. He remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya\u2019s hair. His little stick of a sister. He wondered how she was faring. It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again. He began to flex his hand, opening and closing the fingers. If he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy, it well might be the end of him, he knew. A man needed his sword beyond the Wall.\nJon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards, watering his horses. He had three to tend: his own mount, and two packhorses, each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens. The birds flapped their wings at Jon\u2019s approach and screamed at him through the bars. A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words. \u201cHave you been teaching them to talk?\u201d he asked Sam.\n\u201cA few words. Three of them can say snow.\u201d\n\u201cOne bird croaking my name was bad enough,\u201d said Jon, \u201cand snow\u2019s nothing a black brother wants to hear about.\u201d Snow often meant death in the north.\n\u201cWas there anything in Whitetree?\u201d\n\u201cBones, ashes, and empty houses.\u201d Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment. \u201cThe Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon.\u201d\nSam took a bird from one of the cages, stroked its feathers, attached the message, and said, \u201cFly home now, brave one. Home.\u201d The raven quorked something unintelligible back at him, and Sam tossed it into the air. Flapping, it beat its way skyward through the trees. \u201cI wish he could carry me with him.\u201d\n\u201cStill?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Sam, \u201cyes, but\u2026 I\u2019m not as frightened as I was, truly. The first night, every time I heard someone getting up to make water, I thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat. I was afraid that if I closed my eyes, I might never open them again, only\u2026 well\u2026 dawn came after all.\u201d He managed a wan smile. \u201cI may be craven, but I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground, but I\u2019m hardly scared at all. Look.\u201d He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my maps.\u201d\nThe world is strange, Jon thought. Two hundred brave men had left the Wall, and the only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam, the self-confessed coward. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a ranger of you yet,\u201d he joked. \u201cNext thing, you\u2019ll want to be an outrider like Grenn. Shall I speak to the Old Bear?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse. It was a plow horse, big and slow and clumsy, but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode. \u201cI had hoped we might stay the night in the village,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cIt would be nice to sleep under a roof again.\u201d\n\u201cToo few roofs for all of us.\u201d Jon mounted again, gave Sam a parting smile, and rode off. The column was well under way, so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion. He had seen enough of Whitetree.\nGhost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared. The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march, but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game. The woods were as empty as the villages, Dywen had told him one night around the fire. \u201cWe\u2019re a large party,\u201d Jon had said. \u201cThe game\u2019s probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march.\u201d\n\u201cFrightened away by something, no doubt,\u201d Dywen said.\nOnce the horse had settled, Ghost loped along easily beside him. Jon caught up to Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket. \u201cIs the bird away?\u201d the Old Bear asked.\n\u201cYes, my lord. Sam is teaching them to talk.\u201d\nThe Old Bear snorted. \u201cHe\u2019ll regret that. Damned things make a lot of noise, but they never say a thing worth hearing.\u201d\nThey rode in silence, until Jon said, \u201cIf my uncle found all these villages empty as well\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014he would have made it his purpose to learn why,\u201d Lord Mormont finished for him, \u201cand it may well be someone or something did not want that known. Well, we\u2019ll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us. Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with. We will find them, Jon, I promise you.\u201d\nOr they will find us, thought Jon.",

      "content": "Arya\nThe river was a blue-green ribbon shining in the morning sun. Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks, and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface, ripples spreading out behind it as it went. Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles.\nIt seemed a peaceful place\u2026 until Koss spotted the dead man. \u201cThere, in the reeds.\u201d He pointed, and Arya saw it. The body of a soldier, shapeless and swollen. His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log, and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face. \u201cI told you there was bodies,\u201d Lommy announced. \u201cI could taste them in that water.\u201d\nWhen Yoren saw the corpse, he spat. \u201cDobber, see if he\u2019s got anything worth the taking. Mail, knife, a bit o\u2019 coin, what have you.\u201d He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river, but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened. Yoren rode back angry, his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees. \u201cWe won\u2019t be crossing here. Koss, you\u2019ll come with me upriver, look for a ford. Woth, Gerren, you go downstream. The rest o\u2019 you wait here. Put a guard out.\u201d\nDobber found a leather purse in the dead man\u2019s belt. Inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon. Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, \u201cMud Pie! Mud Pie!\u201d In the back of their wagon, Rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while Yoren was gone, but no one paid him any mind. Kurz caught a fish with his bare hands. Arya saw how he did it, standing over a shallow pool, calm as still water, his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near. It didn\u2019t look as hard as catching cats. Fish didn\u2019t have claws.\nIt was midday when the others returned. Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream, but someone had burned it up. Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale. \u201cMight be we could swim the horses over, maybe the donkeys, but there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll get those wagons across. And there\u2019s smoke to the north and west, more fires, could be this side o\u2019 the river\u2019s the place we want to be.\u201d He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud, a line trailing down from it. \u201cThat\u2019s Gods Eye, with the river flowing south. We\u2019re here.\u201d He poked a hole beside the line of the river, under the circle. \u201cWe can\u2019t go round west of the lake, like I thought. East takes us back to the kingsroad.\u201d He moved the stick up to where the line and circle met. \u201cNear as I recall, there\u2019s a town here. The holdfast\u2019s stone, and there\u2019s a lordling got his seat there too, just a towerhouse, but he\u2019ll have a guard, might be a knight or two. We follow the river north, should be there before dark. They\u2019ll have boats, so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one.\u201d He drew the stick up through the circle of the lake, from bottom to top. \u201cGods be good, we\u2019ll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown.\u201d He thrust the point down at the top of the circle. \u201cWe can buy new mounts there, or else take shelter at Harrenhal. That\u2019s Lady Whent\u2019s seat, and she\u2019s always been a friend o\u2019 the Watch.\u201d\nHot Pie\u2019s eyes got wide. \u201cThere\u2019s ghosts in Harrenhal\u2026\u201d\nYoren spat. \u201cThere\u2019s for your ghosts.\u201d He tossed the stick down in the mud. \u201cMount up.\u201d\nArya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal. Evil King Harren had walled himself up inside, so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre. Nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers. Sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning, all burnt up. Arya didn\u2019t really believe that, and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago. Hot Pie was being silly; it wouldn\u2019t be ghosts at Harrenhal, it would be knights. Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; they kept you safe, especially women. Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl.\nThe river track was no kingsroad, yet it was not half bad for what it was, and for once the wagons rolled along smartly. They saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall, a snug little thatch-roofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat. Yoren rode out ahead, hallooing, but got no answer. \u201cDead, might be. Or hiding. Dobber, Rey, with me.\u201d The three men went into the cottage. \u201cPots is gone, no sign o\u2019 any coin laid by,\u201d Yoren muttered when they returned. \u201cNo animals. Run, most like. Might be we met \u2018em on the kingsroad.\u201d At least the house and field had not been burned, and there were no corpses about. Tarber found a garden out back, and they pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before they went on their way.\nA little farther up the road, they glimpsed a forester\u2019s cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting, and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall, both deserted. They passed more fields, wheat and corn and barley ripening in the sun, but here there were no men sitting in trees, nor walking the rows with scythes. Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord\u2019s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west\u2026 and no sign of any people, anywhere.\nYoren sat on his horse, frowning through his tangle of beard. \u201cDon\u2019t like it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there it is. We\u2019ll go have us a look. A careful look. See maybe there\u2019s some folk hiding. Might be they left a boat behind, or some weapons we can use.\u201d\nThe black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl, and split the rest of them into four groups of five to search the town. \u201cKeep your eyes and ears open,\u201d he warned them, before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling or his guards.\nArya found herself with Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy. Squat, kettle-bellied Woth had pulled an oar on a galley once, which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor, so Yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat. As they rode between the silent white houses, gooseprickles crawled up Arya\u2019s arms. This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they\u2019d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What could scare them so much?\nThe sun was low to the west, and the houses cast long dark shadows. A sudden clap of sound made Arya reach for Needle, but it was only a shutter banging in the wind. After the open river shore, the closeness of the town unnerved her.\nWhen she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees, Arya put her knees into her horse, galloping past Woth and Gendry. She burst out onto the grassy sward beside the pebbled shore. The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper. It was the biggest lake she had ever seen, with no hint of a far shore. She saw a rambling inn to her left, built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings. To her right, a long pier jutted into the lake, and there were other docks farther east, wooden fingers reaching out from the town. But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn, its bottom thoroughly rotted out. \u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d Arya said, dejected. What would they do now?\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inn,\u201d Lommy said, when the others rode up. \u201cDo you think they left any food? Or ale?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go see,\u201d Hot Pie suggested.\n\u201cNever you mind about no inn,\u201d snapped Woth. \u201cYoren said we\u2019re to find a boat.\u201d\n\u201cThey took the boats.\u201d Somehow Arya knew it was true; they could search the whole town, and they\u2019d find no more than the upside-down rowboat. Despondent, she climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around her legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on and off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It tasted of summer and mud and growing things. Arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt good. She wished she could take off her clothes and swim, gliding through the warm water like an skinny pink otter. Maybe she could swim all the way to Winterfell.\nWoth was shouting at her to help search, so she did, peering into boathouses and sheds while her horse grazed along the shore. They found some sails, some nails, buckets of tar gone hard, and a mother cat with a litter of new-born kittens. But no boats.\nThe town was as dark as any forest when Yoren and the others reappeared. \u201cTower\u2019s empty,\u201d he said. \u201cLord\u2019s gone off to fight maybe, or to get his smallfolk to safety, no telling. Not a horse or pig left in town, but we\u2019ll eat. Saw a goose running loose, and some chickens, and there\u2019s good fish in the Gods Eye.\u201d\n\u201cThe boats are gone,\u201d Arya reported.\n\u201cWe could patch the bottom of that rowboat,\u201d said Koss.\n\u201cMight do for four o\u2019 us,\u201d Yoren said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nails,\u201d Lommy pointed out. \u201cAnd there\u2019s trees all around. We could build us all boats.\u201d\nYoren spat. \u201cYou know anything \u2019bout boat-building, dyer\u2019s boy?\u201d Lommy looked blank.\n\u201cA raft,\u201d suggested Gendry. \u201cAnyone can build a raft, and long poles for pushing.\u201d\nYoren looked thoughtful. \u201cLake\u2019s too deep to pole across, but if we stayed to the shallows near shore\u2026 it\u2019d mean leaving the wagons. Might be that\u2019s best. I\u2019ll sleep on it.\u201d\n\u201cCan we stay at the inn?\u201d Lommy asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stay in the holdfast, with the gates barred,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI like the feel o\u2019 stone walls about me when I sleep.\u201d\nArya could not keep quiet. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stay here,\u201d she blurted. \u201cThe people didn\u2019t. They all ran off, even their lord.\u201d\n\u201cArry\u2019s scared,\u201d Lommy announced, braying laughter.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she snapped back, \u201cbut they were.\u201d\n\u201cSmart boy,\u201d said Yoren. \u201cThing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no. We\u2019re not. Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, so no man\u2019s our enemy.\u201d\nAnd no man\u2019s our friend, she thought, but this time she held her tongue. Lommy and the rest were looking at her, and she did not want to seem craven in front of them.\nThe holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings, with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when they\u2019d explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake. Yoren had them roll a wagon on top of the trap, to make certain no one came in that way. He divided them into three watches, and sent Tarber, Kurz, and Cutjack off to the abandoned towerhouse to keep an eye out from on high. Kurz had a hunting horn to sound if danger threatened.\nThey drove their wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind them. The barn was a ramshackle thing, large enough to hold half the animals in the town. The haven, where the townfolk would shelter in times of trouble, was even larger, low and long and built of stone, with a thatched roof. Koss went out the postern gate and brought the goose back, and two chickens as well, and Yoren allowed a cookfire. There was a big kitchen inside the holdfast, though all the pots and kettles had been taken. Gendry, Dobber, and Arya drew cook duty. Dobber told Arya to pluck the fowl while Gendry split wood. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I split the wood?\u201d she asked, but no one listened. Sullenly, she set to plucking a chicken while Yoren sat on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of his dirk with a whetstone.\nWhen the food was ready, Arya ate a chicken leg and a bit of onion. No one talked much, not even Lommy. Gendry went off by himself afterward, polishing his helm with a look on his face like he wasn\u2019t even there. The crying girl whimpered and wept, but when Hot Pie offered her a bit of goose she gobbled it down and looked for more.\nArya drew second watch, so she found a straw pallet in the haven. Sleep did not come easy, so she borrowed Yoren\u2019s stone and set to honing Needle. Syrio Forel had said that a dull blade was like a lame horse. Hot Pie squatted on the pallet beside her, watching her work. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get a good sword like that?\u201d he asked. When he saw the look she gave him, he raised his hands defensively. \u201cI never said you stole it, I just wanted to know where you got it, is all.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother gave it to me,\u201d she muttered.\n\u201cI never knew you had no brother.\u201d\nArya paused to scratch under her shirt. There were fleas in the straw, though she couldn\u2019t see why a few more would bother her. \u201cI have lots of brothers.\u201d\n\u201cYou do? Are they bigger than you, or littler?\u201d\nI shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut. \u201cBigger,\u201d she lied. \u201cThey have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.\u201d\n\u201cI was talking, not bothering.\u201d Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on her pallet. She could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven. I wish she\u2019d just be quiet. Why does she have to cry all the time?\nShe must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once. Arya sat up on her pallet with her heart thumping. \u201cHot Pie, wake up.\u201d She scrambled to her feet. \u201cWoth, Gendry, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d She pulled on a boot.\nAll around her, men and boys stirred and crawled from their pallets. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hot Pie asked. \u201cHear what?\u201d Gendry wanted to know. \u201cArry had a bad dream,\u201d someone else said.\n\u201cNo, I heard it,\u201d she insisted. \u201cA wolf.\u201d\n\u201cArry has wolves in his head,\u201d sneered Lommy. \u201cLet them howl,\u201d Gerren said, \u201cthey\u2019re out there, we\u2019re in here.\u201d Woth agreed. \u201cNever saw no wolf could storm a holdfast.\u201d Hot Pie was saying, \u201cI never heard nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a wolf,\u201d she shouted at them as she yanked on her second boot. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, someone\u2019s coming, get up!\u201d\nBefore they could hoot her down again, the sound came shuddering through the night\u2014only it was no wolf this time, it was Kurz blowing his hunting horn, sounding danger. In a heartbeat, all of them were pulling on clothes and snatching for whatever weapons they owned. Arya ran for the gate as the horn sounded again. As she dashed past the barn, Biter threw himself furiously against his chains, and Jaqen H\u2019ghar called out from the back of their wagon. \u201cBoy! Sweet boy! Is it war, red war? Boy, free us. A man can fight. Boy!\u201d She ignored him and plunged on. By then she could hear horses and shouts beyond the wall.\nShe scrambled up onto the catwalk. The parapets were a bit too high and Arya a bit too short; she had to wedge her toes into the holes between the stones to see over. For a moment she thought the town was full of lantern bugs. Then she realized they were men with torches, galloping between the houses. She saw a roof go up, flames licking at the belly of the night with hot orange tongues as the thatch caught. Another followed, and then another, and soon there were fires blazing everywhere.\nGendry climbed up beside her, wearing his helm. \u201cHow many?\u201d\nArya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung them. \u201cA hundred,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo hundred, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Over the roar of the flames, she could hear shouts. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for us soon.\u201d\n\u201cThere,\u201d Gendry said, pointing.\nA column of riders moved between the burning buildings toward the holdfast. Firelight glittered off metal helms and spattered their mail and plate with orange and yellow highlights. One carried a banner on a tall lance. She thought it was red, but it was hard to tell in the night, with the fires roaring all around. Everything seemed red or black or orange.\nThe fire leapt from one house to another. Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange. Everyone was awake now, manning the catwalks or struggling with the frightened animals below. She could hear Yoren shouting commands. Something bumped against her leg, and she glanced down to discover the crying girl clutching her. \u201cGet away!\u201d She wrenched her leg free. \u201cWhat are you doing up here? Run and hide someplace, you stupid.\u201d She shoved the girl away.\nThe riders reined up before the gates. \u201cYou in the holdfast!\u201d shouted a knight in a tall helm with a spiked crest. \u201cOpen, in the name of the king!\u201d\n\u201cAye, and which king is that?\u201d old Reysen yelled back down, before Woth cuffed him into silence.\nYoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff. \u201cYou men hold down here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe townfolk\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are you, old man? One of Lord Beric\u2019s cravens?\u201d called the knight in the spiked helm. \u201cIf that fat fool Thoros is in there, ask him how he likes these fires.\u201d\n\u201cGot no such man here,\u201d Yoren shouted back. \u201cOnly some lads for the Watch. Got no part o\u2019 your war.\u201d He hoisted up the staff, so they could all see the color of his cloak. \u201cHave a look. That\u2019s black, for the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\n\u201cOr black for House Dondarrion,\u201d called the man who bore the enemy banner. Arya could see its colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town: a golden lion on red. \u201cLord Beric\u2019s sigil is a purple lightning bolt on a black field.\u201d\nSuddenly Arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in Sansa\u2019s face and gotten juice all over her stupid ivory silk gown. There had been some southron lordling at the tourney, her sister\u2019s stupid friend Jeyne was in love with him. He had a lightning bolt on his shield and her father had sent him out to behead the Hound\u2019s brother. It seemed a thousand years ago now, something that had happened to a different person in a different life\u2026 to Arya Stark the Hand\u2019s daughter, not Arry the orphan boy. How would Arry know lords and such?\n\u201cAre you blind, man?\u201d Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. \u201cYou see a bloody lightning bolt?\u201d\n\u201cBy night all banners look black,\u201d the knight in the spiked helm observed. \u201cOpen, or we\u2019ll know you for outlaws in league with the king\u2019s enemies.\u201d\nYoren spat. \u201cWho\u2019s got your command?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d The reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse as the others parted to let him pass. He was a stout man with a manticore on his shield, and ornate scrollwork crawling across his steel breastplate. Through the open visor of his helm, a face pale and piggy peered up. \u201cSer Amory Lorch, bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock, the Hand of the King. The true king, Joffrey.\u201d He had a high, thin voice. \u201cIn his name, I command you to open these gates.\u201d\nAll around them, the town burned. The night air was full of smoke, and the drifting red embers outnumbered the stars. Yoren scowled. \u201cDon\u2019t see the need. Do what you want to the town, it\u2019s naught to me, but leave us be. We\u2019re no foes to you.\u201d\nLook with your eyes, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. \u201cCan\u2019t they see we\u2019re no lords or knights?\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they care, Arry,\u201d Gendry whispered back.\nAnd she looked at Ser Amory\u2019s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw that he was right.\n\u201cIf you are no traitors, open your gates,\u201d Ser Amory called. \u201cWe\u2019ll make certain you\u2019re telling it true and be on our way.\u201d\nYoren was chewing sourleaf. \u201cTold you, no one here but us. You got my word on that.\u201d\nThe knight in the spiked helm laughed. \u201cThe crow gives us his word.\u201d\n\u201cYou lost, old man?\u201d mocked one of the spearmen. \u201cThe Wall\u2019s a long way north o\u2019 here.\u201d\n\u201cI command you once more, in King Joffrey\u2019s name, to prove the loyalty you profess and open these gates,\u201d said Ser Amory.\nFor a long moment Yoren considered, chewing. Then he spat. \u201cDon\u2019t think I will.\u201d\n\u201cSo be it. You defy the king\u2019s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.\u201d\n\u201cGot me young boys in here,\u201d Yoren shouted down.\n\u201cYoung boys and old men die the same.\u201d Ser Amory raised a lanquid fist, and a spear came hurtling from the fire-bright shadows behind. Yoren must have been the target, but it was Woth beside him who was hit. The spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the back of his neck, dark and wet. Woth grabbed at the shaft, and fell boneless from the walk.\n\u201cStorm the walls and kill them all,\u201d Ser Amory said in a bored voice. More spears flew. Arya yanked down Hot Pie by the back of his tunic. From outside came the rattle of armor, the scrape of swords on scabbards, the banging of spears on shields, mingled with curses and the hoofbeats of racing horses. A torch sailed spinning above their heads, trailing fingers of fire as it thumped down in the dirt of the yard.\n\u201cBlades!\u201d Yoren shouted. \u201cSpread apart, defend the wall wherever they hit. Koss, Urreg, hold the postern. Lommy, pull that spear out of Woth and get up where he was.\u201d\nHot Pie dropped his shortsword when he tried to unsheath it. Arya shoved the blade back into his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to swordfight,\u201d he said, white-eyed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d Arya said, but the lie died in her throat as a hand grasped the top of the parapet. She saw it by the light of the burning town, so clear that it was as if time had stopped. The fingers were blunt, callused, wiry black hairs grew between the knuckles, there was dirt under the nail of the thumb. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she remembered as the top of a pothelm loomed up behind the hand.\nShe slashed down hard, and Needle\u2019s castle-forged steel bit into the grasping fingers between the knuckles. \u201cWinterfell!\u201d she screamed. Blood spurted, fingers flew, and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. \u201cBehind!\u201d Hot Pie yelled. Arya whirled. The second man was bearded and helmetless, his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing. As he swung his leg over the parapet, she drove her point at his eyes. Needle never touched him; he reeled backward and fell. I hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue. \u201cWatch them, not me!\u201d she screamed at Hot Pie. The next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall, the boy hacked at his hands with his swordshort until the man dropped away.\nSer Amory had no ladders, but the holdfast walls were rough-cut and unmortared, easy to climb, and there seemed to be no end to the foes. For each one Arya cut or stabbed or shoved back, another was coming over the wall. The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart, but Yoren tangled his black banner around his spike, and forced the point of his dirk through his armor while the man was fighting the cloth. Every time Arya looked up, more torches were flying, trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes. She saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of Joffrey, wishing he was here so she could drive Needle through his sneery face. When four men assaulted the gate with axes, Koss shot them down with arrows, one by one. Dobber wrestled a man off the walk, and Lommy smashed his head with a rock before he could rise, and hooted until he saw the knife in Dobber\u2019s belly and realized he wouldn\u2019t be getting up either. Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon, lying with his arm cut off. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done it, but she wasn\u2019t sure. She heard Qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked mace. Everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss, but after a time it seemed like that was only one smell. She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall, but when he did she fell on him with Gendry and Hot Pie. Gendry\u2019s sword shattered on the man\u2019s helm, tearing it off his head. Underneath he was bald and scared-looking, with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard, but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him, shouting, \u201cWinterfell! Winterfell!\u201d while Hot Pie screamed \u201cHot Pie!\u201d beside her as he hacked at the man\u2019s scrawny neck.\nWhen the skinny man was dead, Gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more. Arya looked past him, and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast, firelight shining off mail and blades, and she knew that they\u2019d gotten over the wall somewhere, or broken through at the postern. She jumped down beside Gendry, landing the way Syrio had taught her. The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.\nAnd then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. \u201cBoy!\u201d he yelled, the way he always yelled it. \u201cGet out, it\u2019s done, we\u2019ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Arya said.\n\u201cThat trap,\u201d he screamed. \u201cUnder the barn.\u201d\nQuick as that he was gone, off to fight, sword in hand. Arya grabbed Gendry by the arm. \u201cHe said go,\u201d she shouted, \u201cthe barn, the way out.\u201d Through the slits of his helm, the Bull\u2019s eyes shone with reflected fire. He nodded. They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf. They found Gerren too, but he was hurt too bad to move. As they were running toward the barn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn\u2019t walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left. Ahead, the night was a sullen red. The barn\u2019s on fire, she thought. Flames were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within. Hot Pie stepped out of the barn. \u201cArry, come on! Lommy\u2019s gone, leave her if she won\u2019t come!\u201d\nStubbornly, Arya dragged all the harder, pulling the crying girl along. Hot Pie scuttled back inside, abandoning them\u2026 but Gendry came back, the fire shining so bright on his polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange. He ran to them, and hoisted the crying girl up over his shoulder. \u201cRun!\u201d\nRushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace. The air was swirling with smoke, the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof. Their horses and donkeys were kicking and rearing and screaming. The poor animals, Arya thought. Then she saw the wagon, and the three men manacled to its bed. Biter was flinging himself against the chains, blood running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists. Rorge screamed curses, kicking at the wood. \u201cBoy!\u201d called Jaqen H\u2019ghar. \u201cSweet boy!\u201d\nThe open trap was only a few feet ahead, but the fire was spreading fast, consuming the old wood and dry straw faster than she would have believed. Arya remembered the Hound\u2019s horrible burned face. \u201cTunnel\u2019s narrow,\u201d Gendry shouted. \u201cHow do we get her through?\u201d\n\u201cPull her,\u201d Arya said. \u201cPush her.\u201d\n\u201cGood boys, kind boys,\u201d called Jaqen H\u2019ghar, coughing.\n\u201cGet these fucking chains off!\u201d Rorge screamed.\nGendry ignored them. \u201cYou go first, then her, then me. Hurry, it\u2019s a long way.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you split the firewood,\u201d Arya remembered, \u201cwhere did you leave the axe?\u201d\n\u201cOut by the haven.\u201d He spared a glance for the chained men. \u201cI\u2019d save the donkeys first. There\u2019s no time.\u201d\n\u201cYou take her!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou get her out! You do it!\u201d The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where he stood. Smoke was everywhere. There was no sign of Yoren, but the axe was where Gendry had left it, by the woodpile outside the haven. As she wrenched it free, a mailed hand grabbed her arm. Spinning, Arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs. She never saw his face, only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk. Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men. She chewed her lip, and darted through the doors, crouched low where the smoke wasn\u2019t quite so thick.\nA donkey was caught in a ring of fire, shrieking in terror and pain. She could smell the stench of burning hair. The roof was gone up too, and things were falling down, pieces of flaming wood and bits of straw and hay. Arya put a hand over her mouth and nose. She couldn\u2019t see the wagon for the smoke, but she could still hear Biter screaming. She crawled toward the sound.\nAnd then a wheel was looming over her. The wagon jumped and moved a half foot when Biter threw himself against his chains again. Jaqen saw her, but it was too hard to breathe, let alone talk. She threw the axe into the wagon. Rorge caught it and lifted it over his head, rivers of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face. Arya was running, coughing. She heard the steel crash through the old wood, and again, again. An instant later came a crack as loud as thunder, and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters.\nArya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but she didn\u2019t care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThe queen was not disposed to wait on Varys. \u201cTreason is vile enough,\u201d she declared furiously, \u201cbut this is barefaced naked villainy, and I do not need that mincing eunuch to tell me what must be done with villains.\u201d\nTyrion took the letters from his sister\u2019s hand and compared them side by side. There were two copies, the words exactly alike, though they had been written by different hands.\n\u201cMaester Frenken received the first missive at Castle Stokeworth,\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle explained. \u201cThe second copy came through Lord Gyles.\u201d\nLittlefinger fingered his beard. \u201cIf Stannis bothered with them, it\u2019s past certain every other lord in the Seven Kingdoms saw a copy as well.\u201d\n\u201cI want these letters burned, every one,\u201d Cersei declared. \u201cNo hint of this must reach my son\u2019s ears, or my father\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI imagine Father\u2019s heard rather more than a hint by now,\u201d Tyrion said dryly. \u201cDoubtless Stannis sent a bird to Casterly Rock, and another to Harrenhal. As for burning the letters, to what point? The song is sung, the wine is spilled, the wench is pregnant. And this is not as dire as it seems, in truth.\u201d\nCersei turned on him in green-eyed fury. \u201cAre you utterly witless? Did you read what he says? The boy Joffrey, he calls him. And he dares to accuse me of incest, adultery, and treason!\u201d\nOnly because you\u2019re guilty. It was astonishing to see how angry Cersei could wax over accusations she knew perfectly well to be true. If we lose the war, she ought to take up mummery, she has a gift for it. Tyrion waited until she was done and said, \u201cStannis must have some pretext to justify his rebellion. What did you expect him to write? \u2018Joffrey is my brother\u2019s trueborn son and heir, but I mean to take his throne for all that\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI will not suffer to be called a whore!\u201d\nWhy, sister, he never claims Jaime paid you. Tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again. There had been some niggling phrase\u2026\u201cDone in the Light of the Lord,\u201d he read. \u201cA queer choice of words, that.\u201d\nPycelle cleared his throat. \u201cThese words often appear in letters and documents from the Free Cities. They mean no more than, let us say, written in the sight of god. The god of the red priests. It is their usage, I do believe.\u201d\n\u201cVarys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a red priest,\u201d Littlefinger reminded them.\nTyrion tapped the paper. \u201cAnd now it would seem her lord husband has done the same. We can use that against him. Urge the High Septon to reveal how Stannis has turned against the gods as well as his rightful king\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the queen said impatiently, \u201cbut first we must stop this filth from spreading further. The council must issue an edict. Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joff a bastard should lose his tongue for it.\u201d\n\u201cA prudent measure,\u201d said Grand Maester Pycelle, his chain of office clinking as he nodded.\n\u201cA folly,\u201d sighed Tyrion. \u201cWhen you tear out a man\u2019s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you\u2019re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.\u201d\n\u201cSo what would you have us do?\u201d his sister demanded.\n\u201cVery little. Let them whisper, they\u2019ll grow bored with the tale soon enough. Any man with a thimble of sense will see it for a clumsy attempt to justify usurping the crown. Does Stannis offer proof? How could he, when it never happened?\u201d Tyrion gave his sister his sweetest smile.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d she had to say. \u201cStill\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace, your brother has the right of this.\u201d Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers. \u201cIf we attempt to silence this talk, we only lend it credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the pathetic lie it is. And meantime, fight fire with fire.\u201d\nCersei gave him a measuring look. \u201cWhat sort of fire?\u201d\n\u201cA tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. But more easily believed. Lord Stannis has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife. Not that I fault him, I\u2019d do the same were I married to Lady Selyse. Nonetheless, if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well\u2026 the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.\u201d\n\u201cHe has never been much loved, that\u2019s true.\u201d Cersei considered a moment. \u201cSo we pay him back in his own coin. Yes, I like this. Who can we name as Lady Selyse\u2019s lover? She has two brothers, I believe. And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSer Axell Florent is her castellan.\u201d Loath as Tyrion was to admit it, Littlefinger\u2019s scheme had promise. Stannis had never been enamored of his wife, but he was bristly as a hedgehog where his honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature. If they could sow discord between him and his followers, it could only help their cause. \u201cThe child has the Florent ears, I\u2019m told.\u201d\nLittlefinger gestured languidly. \u201cA trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord Stannis must love his daughter very well, since he\u2019d erected hundreds of statues of her all along the walls of Dragonstone. \u2018My lord\u2019 I had to tell him, \u2018those are gargoyles.\u2019\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSer Axell might serve for Shireen\u2019s father, but in my experience, the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated. Stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool, a lackwit with a tattooed face.\u201d\nGrand Maester Pycelle gaped at him, aghast. \u201cSurely you do not mean to suggest that Lady Selyse would bring a fool into her bed?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse Florent,\u201d said Littlefinger. \u201cDoubtless Patchface reminded her of Stannis. And the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause. As it happens, this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and follows her everywhere. They even look somewhat alike. Shireen has a mottled, half-frozen face as well.\u201d\nPycelle was lost. \u201cBut that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe, poor thing.\u201d\n\u201cI like my tale better,\u201d said Littlefinger, \u201cand so will the smallfolk. Most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant, her child will be born with long floppy ears.\u201d\nCersei smiled the sort of smile she customarily reserved for Jaime. \u201cLord Petyr, you are a wicked creature.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a most accomplished liar,\u201d Tyrion added, less warmly. This one is more dangerous than I knew, he reflected.\nLittlefinger\u2019s grey-green eyes met the dwarf\u2019s mismatched stare with no hint of unease. \u201cWe all have our gifts, my lord.\u201d\nThe queen was too caught up in her revenge to take note of the exchange. \u201cCuckolded by a halfwit fool! Stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea.\u201d\n\u201cThe story should not come from us,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201cor it will be seen for a self-serving lie.\u201d Which it is, to be sure.\nOnce more Littlefinger supplied the answer. \u201cWhores love to gossip, and as it happens I own a brothel or three. And no doubt Varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and pot-shops.\u201d\n\u201cVarys,\u201d Cersei said, frowning. \u201cWhere is Varys?\u201d\n\u201cI have been wondering about that myself, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cThe Spider spins his secret webs day and night,\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle said ominously. \u201cI mistrust that one, my lords.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he speaks so kindly of you.\u201d Tyrion pushed himself off his chair. As it happened, he knew what the eunuch was about, but it was nothing the other councillors needed to hear. \u201cPray excuse me, my lords. Other business calls.\u201d\nCersei was instantly suspicious. \u201cKing\u2019s business?\u201d\n\u201cNothing you need trouble yourself about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d\n\u201cWould you spoil my surprise?\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cI\u2019m having a gift made for Joffrey. A little chain.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does he need with another chain? He has gold chains and silver, more than he can wear. If you think for a moment you can buy Joff\u2019s love with gifts\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy, surely I have the king\u2019s love, as he has mine. And this chain I believe he may one day treasure above all others.\u201d The little man bowed and waddled to the door.\nBronn was waiting outside the council chambers to escort him back to the Tower of the Hand. \u201cThe smiths are in your audience chamber, waiting your pleasure,\u201d he said as they crossed the ward.\n\u201cWaiting my pleasure. I like the ring of that, Bronn. You almost sound a proper courtier. Next you\u2019ll be kneeling.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Shae\u2019s task.\u201d Tyrion heard Lady Tanda calling to him merrily from the top of the serpentine steps. Pretending not to notice her, he waddled a bit faster. \u201cSee that my litter is readied, I\u2019ll be leaving the castle as soon as I\u2019m done here.\u201d Two of the Moon Brothers had the door guard. Tyrion greeted them pleasantly, and grimaced before starting up the stairs. The climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache.\nWithin he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed; his squire, such that he was. Podrick Payne was so shy he was furtive. Tyrion had never quite gotten over the suspicion that his father had inflicted the boy on him as a joke.\n\u201cYour garb, my lord,\u201d the boy mumbled when Tyrion entered, staring down at his boots. Even when he worked up the courage to speak, Pod could never quite manage to look at you. \u201cFor the audience. And your chain. The Hand\u2019s chain.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. Help me dress.\u201d The doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in the shape of lions\u2019 heads, the chain a loop of solid gold hands, the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next. Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold, cut to his height. On a normal man, it would be no more than a half cape.\nThe Hand\u2019s private audience chamber was not so large as the king\u2019s, nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room, but Tyrion liked its Myrish rugs, wall hangings, and sense of intimacy. As he entered, his steward cried out, \u201cTyrion Lannister, Hand of the King.\u201d He liked that too. The gaggle of smiths, armorers, and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell to their knees.\nHe hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them rise. \u201cGoodmen, I know you are all busy, so I will be succinct. Pod, if you please.\u201d The boy handed him a canvas sack. Tyrion yanked the drawstring and upended the bag. Its contents spilled onto the rug with a muffled thunk of metal on wool. \u201cI had these made at the castle forge. I want a thousand more just like them.\u201d\nOne of the smiths knelt to inspect the object: three immense steel links, twisted together. \u201cA mighty chain.\u201d\n\u201cMighty, but short,\u201d the dwarf replied. \u201cSomewhat like me. I fancy one a good deal longer. Do you have a name?\u201d\n\u201cThey call me Ironbelly, m\u2019lord.\u201d The smith was squat and broad, plainly dressed in wool and leather, but his arms were as thick as a bull\u2019s neck.\n\u201cI want every forge in King\u2019s Landing turned to making these links and joining them. All other work is to be put aside. I want every man who knows the art of working metal set to this task, be he master, journeyman, or apprentice. When I ride up the Street of Steel, I want to hear hammers ringing, night or day. And I want a man, a strong man, to see that all this is done. Are you that man, Goodman Ironbelly?\u201d\n\u201cMight be I am, m\u2019lord. But what of the mail and swords the queen was wanting?\u201d\nAnother smith spoke up. \u201cHer Grace commanded us to make chainmail and armor, swords and daggers and axes, all in great numbers. For arming her new gold cloaks, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cThat work can wait,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cThe chain first.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord, begging your pardon, Her Grace said those as didn\u2019t meet their numbers would have their hands crushed,\u201d the anxious Smith persisted. \u201cSmashed on their own anvils, she said.\u201d\nSweet Cersei, always striving to make the smallfolk love us. \u201cNo one will have their hands smashed. You have my word on it.\u201d\n\u201cIron is grown dear,\u201d Ironbelly declared, \u201cand this chain will be needing much of it, and coke beside, for the fires.\u201d\n\u201cLord Baelish will see that you have coin as you need it,\u201d Tyrion promised. He could count on Littlefinger for that much, he hoped. \u201cI will command the City Watch to help you find iron. Melt down every horseshoe in this city if you must.\u201d\nAn older man moved forward, richly dressed in a damask tunic with silver fastenings and a cloak lined with foxfur. He knelt to examine the great steel links Tyrion had dumped on the floor. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he announced gravely, \u201cthis is crude work at best. There is no art to it. Suitable labor for common smiths, no doubt, for men who bend horseshoes and hammer out kettles, but I am a master armorer, as it please my lord. This is no work for me, nor my fellow masters. We make swords as sharp as song, armor such as a god might wear. Not this.\u201d\nTyrion tilted his head to the side and gave the man a dose of his mismatched eyes. \u201cWhat is your name, master armorer?\u201d\n\u201cSalloreon, as it please my lord. If the King\u2019s Hand will permit, I should be most honored to forge him a suit of armor suitable to his House and high office.\u201d Two of the others sniggered, but Salloreon plunged ahead, heedless. \u201cPlate and scale, I think. The scales gilded bright as the sun, the plate enameled a deep Lannister crimson. I would suggest a demon\u2019s head for a helm, crowned with tall golden horns. When you ride into battle, men will shrink away in fear.\u201d\nA demon\u2019s head, Tyrion thought ruefully, now what does that say of me? \u201cMaster Salloreon, I plan to fight the rest of my battles from this chair. It\u2019s links I need, not demon horns. So let me put it to you this way. You will make chains, or you will wear them. The choice is yours.\u201d He rose, and took his leave with nary a backward glance.\nBronn was waiting by the gate with his litter and an escort of mounted Black Ears. \u201cYou know where we\u2019re bound,\u201d Tyrion told him. He accepted a hand up into the litter. He had done all he could to feed the hungry city\u2014he\u2019d set several hundred carpenters to building fishing boats in place of catapults, opened the kingswood to any hunter who dared to cross the river, even sent gold cloaks foraging to the west and south\u2014yet he still saw accusing eyes everywhere he rode. The litter\u2019s curtains shielded him from that, and besides gave him leisure to think.\nAs they wound their slow way down twisty Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon\u2019s High Hill, Tyrion reflected on the events of the morning. His sister\u2019s ire had led her to overlook the true significance of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s letter. Without proof, his accusations were nothing; what mattered was that he had named himself a king. And what will Renly make of that? They could not both sit the Iron Throne.\nIdly, he pushed the curtain back a few inches to peer out at the streets. Black Ears rode on both sides of him, their grisly necklaces looped about their throats, while Bronn went in front to clear the way. He watched the passersby watching him, and played a little game with himself, trying to sort the informers from the rest. The ones who look the most suspicious are likely innocent, he decided. It\u2019s the ones who look innocent I need to beware.\nHis destination was behind the hill of Rhaenys, and the streets were crowded. Almost an hour had passed before the litter swayed to a stop. Tyrion was dozing, but he woke abruptly when the motion ceased, rubbed the sand from his eyes, and accepted Bronn\u2019s hand to climb down.\nThe house was two stories tall, stone below and timber above. A round turret rose from one corner of the structure. Many of the windows were leaded. Over the door swung an ornate lamp, a globe of gilded metal and scarlet glass.\n\u201cA brothel,\u201d Bronn said. \u201cWhat do you mean to do here?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does one usually do in a brothel?\u201d\nThe sellsword laughed. \u201cShae\u2019s not enough?\u201d\n\u201cShe was pretty enough for a camp follower, but I\u2019m no longer in camp. Little men have big appetites, and I\u2019m told the girls here are fit for a king.\u201d\n\u201cIs the boy old enough?\u201d\n\u201cNot Joffrey. Robert. This house was a great favorite of his.\u201d Although Joffrey may indeed be old enough. An interesting notion, that. \u201cIf you and the Black Ears care to amuse yourselves, feel free, but Chataya\u2019s girls are costly. You\u2019ll find cheaper houses all along the street. Leave one man here who\u2019ll know where to find the others when I wish to return.\u201d\nBronn nodded. \u201cAs you say.\u201d The Black Ears were all grins.\nInside the door, a tall woman in flowing silks was waiting for him. She had ebon skin and sandalwood eyes. \u201cI am Chataya,\u201d she announced, bowing deeply. \u201cAnd you are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet us not get into the habit of names. Names are dangerous.\u201d The air smelled of some exotic spice, and the floor beneath his feet displayed a mosaic of two women entwined in love. \u201cYou have a pleasant establishment.\u201d\n\u201cI have labored long to make it so. I am glad the Hand is pleased.\u201d Her voice was flowing amber, liquid with the accents of the distant Summer Isles.\n\u201cTitles can be as dangerous as names,\u201d Tyrion warned. \u201cShow me a few of your girls.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be my great delight. You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful, and skilled in every art of love.\u201d She swept off gracefully, leaving Tyrion to waddle after as best he could on legs half the length of hers.\nFrom behind an ornate Myrish screen carved with flowers and fancies and dreaming maidens, they peered unseen into a common room where an old man was playing a cheerful air on the pipes. In a cushioned alcove, a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a buxom young wench on his knee. He\u2019d unlaced her bodice and was tilting his cup to pour a thin trickle of wine over her breasts so he might lap it off. Two other girls sat playing at tiles before a leaded glass window. The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed hair. The other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet, wide dark eyes, small pointed breasts. They dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts. The sunlight pouring through the colored glass outlined their sweet young bodies through the thin cloth, and Tyrion felt a stirring in his groin. \u201cI would respectfully suggest the dark-skinned girl,\u201d said Chataya.\n\u201cShe\u2019s young.\u201d\n\u201cShe has sixteen years, my lord.\u201d\nA good age for Joffrey, he thought, remembering what Bronn had said. His first had been even younger. Tyrion remembered how shy she\u2019d seemed as he drew her dress up over her head the first time. Long dark hair and blue eyes you could drown in, and he had. So long ago\u2026 What a wretched fool you are, dwarf. \u201cDoes she come from your home lands, this girl?\u201d\n\u201cHer blood is the blood of summer, my lord, but my daughter was born here in King\u2019s Landing.\u201d His surprise must have shown on his face, for Chataya continued, \u201cMy people hold that there is no shame to be found in the pillow house. In the Summer Isles, those who are skilled at giving pleasure are greatly esteemed. Many highborn youths and maidens serve for a few years after their flowerings, to honor the gods.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do the gods have to do with it?\u201d\n\u201cThe gods made our bodies as well as our souls, is it not so? They give us voices, so we might worship them with song. They give us hands, so we might build them temples. And they give us desire, so we might mate and worship them in that way.\u201d\n\u201cRemind me to tell the High Septon,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cIf I could pray with my cock, I\u2019d be much more religious.\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cI will gladly accept your suggestion.\u201d\n\u201cI shall summon my daughter. Come.\u201d\nThe girl met him at the foot of the stairs. Taller than Shae, though not so tall as her mother, she had to kneel before Tyrion could kiss her. \u201cMy name is Alayaya,\u201d she said, with only the slightest hint of her mother\u2019s accent. \u201cCome, my lord.\u201d She took him by the hand and drew him up two flights of stairs, then down a long hall. Gasps and shrieks of pleasure were coming from behind one of the closed doors, giggles and whispers from another. Tyrion\u2019s cock pressed against the lacings of his breeches. This could be humiliating, he thought as he followed Alayaya up another stair to the turret room. There was only one door. She led him through and closed it. Within the room was a great canopied bed, a tall wardrobe decorated with erotic carvings, and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow diamonds.\n\u201cYou are very beautiful, Alayaya,\u201d Tyrion told her when they were alone. \u201cFrom head to heels, every part of you is lovely. Yet just now the part that interests me most is your tongue.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord will find my tongue well schooled. When I was a girl I learned when to use it, and when not.\u201d\n\u201cThat pleases me.\u201d Tyrion smiled. \u201cSo what shall we do now? Perchance you have some suggestion?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my lord will open the wardrobe, he will find what he seeks.\u201d\nTyrion kissed her hand, and climbed inside the empty wardrobe. Alayaya closed it after him. He groped for the back panel, felt it slide under his fingers, and pushed it all the way aside. The hollow space behind the walls was pitch-black, but he fumbled until he felt metal. His hand closed around the rung of a ladder. He found a lower rung with his foot, and started down. Well below street level, the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel, where he found Varys waiting with candle in hand.\nVarys did not look at all like himself. A scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his spiked steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, dirk and shortsword at his belt. \u201cWas Chataya\u2019s to your satisfaction, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost too much so,\u201d admitted Tyrion. \u201cYou\u2019re certain this woman can be relied on?\u201d\n\u201cI am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world, my lord. Chataya has no cause to love the queen, though, and she knows that she has you to thank for ridding her of Allar Deem. Shall we go?\u201d He started down the tunnel.\nEven his walk is different, Tyrion observed. The scent of sour wine and garlic clung to Varys instead of lavender. \u201cI like this new garb of yours,\u201d he offered as they went.\n\u201cThe work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights. So when I leave the castle, I adopt more suitable guises, and thus live to serve you longer.\u201d\n\u201cLeather becomes you. You ought to come like this to our next council session.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister would not approve, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cMy sister would soil her smallclothes.\u201d He smiled in the dark. \u201cI saw no signs of any of her spies skulking after me.\u201d\n\u201cI am pleased to hear it, my lord. Some of your sister\u2019s hirelings are mine as well, unbeknownst to her. I should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for naught.\u201d\n\u201cScarcely for naught,\u201d Varys assured him. \u201cThey know you are here. Whether any will be bold enough to enter Chataya\u2019s in the guise of patrons I cannot say, but I find it best to err on the side of caution.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?\u201d\n\u201cThe tunnel was dug for another King\u2019s Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you knew of it.\u201d\n\u201cLittle birds fly through many a dark tunnel. Careful, the steps are steep.\u201d\nThey emerged through a trap at the back of a stable, having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under Rhaenys\u2019s Hill. A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut. Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about. A mule and three horses occupied the stalls. He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth. \u201cOld,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have my doubts about his wind.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not a mount to carry you into battle, true,\u201d Varys replied, \u201cbut he will serve, and attract no notice. As will the others. And the stableboys see and hear only the animals.\u201d The eunuch took a cloak from a peg. It was roughspun, sun-faded, and threadbare, but very ample in its cut. \u201cIf you will permit me.\u201d When he swept it over Tyrion\u2019s shoulders it enveloped him head to heel, with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows. \u201cMen see what they expect to see,\u201d Varys said as he fussed and pulled. \u201cDwarfs are not so common a sight as children, so a child is what they will see. A boy in an old cloak on his father\u2019s horse, going about his father\u2019s business. Though it would be best if you came most often by night.\u201d\n\u201cI plan to\u2026 after today. At the moment, though, Shae awaits me.\u201d He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King\u2019s Landing, not far from the sea, but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed.\n\u201cWhich horse will you have?\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cThis one will do well enough.\u201d\n\u201cI shall saddle him for you.\u201d Varys took tack and saddle down from a peg.\nTyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly. \u201cYou missed a lively council. Stannis has crowned himself, it seems.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cHe accuses my brother and sister of incest. I wonder how he came by that suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard\u2019s hair, as Ned Stark did, and Jon Arryn before him. Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear.\u201d The eunuch\u2019s laugh was not his usual giggle, but deeper and more throaty.\n\u201cSomeone like you, perchance?\u201d\n\u201cAm I suspected? It was not me.\u201d\n\u201cIf it had been, would you admit it?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long? It is one thing to deceive a king, and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney. Besides, the bastards were there for all to see.\u201d\n\u201cRobert\u2019s bastards? What of them?\u201d\n\u201cHe fathered eight, to the best of my knowing,\u201d Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. \u201cTheir mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens\u2026 and as ill-omened, it would seem. So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen slid out between your sister\u2019s thighs, each as golden as the sun, the truth was not hard to glimpse.\u201d\nTyrion shook his head. If she had borne only one child for her husband, it would have been enough to disarm suspicion\u2026 but then she would not have been Cersei. \u201cIf you were not this whisperer, who was?\u201d\n\u201cSome traitor, doubtless.\u201d Varys tightened the cinch.\n\u201cLittlefinger?\u201d\n\u201cI named no name.\u201d\nTyrion let the eunuch help him mount. \u201cLord Varys,\u201d he said from the saddle, \u201csometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King\u2019s Landing, and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy.\u201d\n\u201cHow odd. I think quite the same of you.\u201d",

      "content": "Bran\nLong before the first pale fingers of light pried apart Bran\u2019s shutters, his eyes were open.\nThere were guests in Winterfell, visitors come for the harvest feast. This morning they would be tilting at quintains in the yard. Once that prospect would have filled him with excitement, but that was before.\nNot now. The Walders would break lances with the squires of Lord Manderly\u2019s escort, but Bran would have no part of it. He must play the prince in his father\u2019s solar. \u201cListen, and it may be that you will learn something of what lordship is all about,\u201d Maester Luwin had said.\nBran had never asked to be a prince. It was knighthood he had always dreamed of; bright armor and streaming banners, lance and sword, a warhorse between his legs. Why must he waste his days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood? Because you\u2019re broken, a voice inside reminded him. A lord on his cushioned chair might be crippled\u2014the Walders said their grandfather was so feeble he had to be carried everywhere in a litter\u2014but not a knight on his destrier. Besides, it was his duty. \u201cYou are your brother\u2019s heir and the Stark in Winterfell,\u201d Ser Rodrik said, reminding him of how Robb used to sit with their lord father when his bannermen came to see him.\nLord Wyman Manderly had arrived from White Harbor two days past, traveling by barge and litter, as he was too fat to sit a horse. With him had come a long tail of retainers: knights, squires, lesser lords and ladies, heralds, musicians, even a juggler, all aglitter with banners and surcoats in what seemed half a hundred colors. Bran had welcomed them to Winterfell from his father\u2019s high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms, and afterward Ser Rodrik had said he\u2019d done well. If that had been the end of it, he would not have minded. But it was only the beginning.\n\u201cThe feast makes a pleasant pretext,\u201d Ser Rodrik explained, \u201cbut a man does not cross a hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine. Only those who have matters of import to set before us are like to make the journey.\u201d\nBran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above his head. Robb would tell him not to play the boy, he knew. He could almost hear him, and their lord father as well. Winter is coming, and you are almost a man grown, Bran. You have a duty.\nWhen Hodor came bustling in, smiling and humming tunelessly, he found the boy resigned to his fate. Together they got him washed and brushed. \u201cThe white wool doublet today,\u201d Bran commanded. \u201cAnd the silver brooch. Ser Rodrik will want me to look lordly.\u201d As much as he could, Bran preferred to dress himself, but there were some tasks\u2014pulling on breeches, lacing his boots\u2014that vexed him. They went quicker with Hodor\u2019s help. Once he had been taught to do something, he did it deftly. His hands were always gentle, though his strength was astonishing. \u201cYou could have been a knight too, I bet,\u201d Bran told him. \u201cIf the gods hadn\u2019t taken your wits, you would have been a great knight.\u201d\n\u201cHodor?\u201d Hodor blinked at him with guileless brown eyes, eyes innocent of understanding.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Bran. \u201cHodor.\u201d He pointed.\nOn the wall beside the door hung a basket, stoutly made of wicker and leather, with holes cut for Bran\u2019s legs. Hodor slid his arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight around his chest, then knelt beside the bed. Bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support himself as he swung the dead weight of his legs into the basket and through the holes.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor said again, rising. The stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by himself; on his back Bran\u2019s head almost brushed the ceiling. He ducked low as they passed through the door. One time Hodor smelled bread baking and ran to the kitchens, and Bran got such a crack that Maester Luwin had to sew up his scalp. Mikken had given him a rusty old visorless helm from the armory, but Bran seldom troubled to wear it. The Walders laughed whenever they saw it on his head.\nHe rested his hands on Hodor\u2019s shoulders as they descended the winding stair. Outside, the sounds of sword and shield and horse already rang through the yard. It made a sweet music. I\u2019ll just have a look, Bran thought, a quick look, that\u2019s all.\nThe White Harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning, with their knights and men-at-arms. Until then, the yard belonged to their squires, who ranged in age from ten to forty. Bran wished he were one of them so badly that his stomach hurt with the wanting.\nTwo quintains had been erected in the courtyard, each a stout post supporting a spinning crossbeam with a shield at one end and a padded butt at the other. The shields had been painted red-and-gold, though the Lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen, and already well scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at them.\nThe sight of Bran in his basket drew stares from those who had not seen it before, but he had learned to ignore stares. At least he had a good view; on Hodor\u2019s back, he towered over everyone. The Walders were mounting up, he saw. They\u2019d brought fine armor up from the Twins, shining silver plate with enameled blue chasings. Big Walder\u2019s crest was shaped like a castle, while Little Walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk. Their shields and surcoats also set them apart from each other. Little Walder quartered the twin towers of Frey with the brindled boar of his grandmother\u2019s House and the plowman of his mother\u2019s: Crakehall and Darry, respectively. Big Walder\u2019s quarterings were the tree-and-ravens of House Blackwood and the twining snakes of the Paeges. They must be hungry for honor, Bran thought as he watched them take up their lances. A Stark needs only the direwolf.\nTheir dappled grey coursers were swift, strong, and beautifully trained. Side by side they charged the quintains. Both hit the shields cleanly and were well past before the padded butts came spinning around. Little Walder struck the harder blow, but Bran thought Big Walder sat his horse better. He would have given both his useless legs for the chance to ride against either.\nLittle Walder cast his splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up. \u201cNow there\u2019s an ugly horse,\u201d he said of Hodor.\n\u201cHodor\u2019s no horse,\u201d Bran said.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor.\nBig Walder trotted up to join his cousin. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not as smart as a horse, that\u2019s for certain.\u201d A few of the White Harbor lads poked each other and laughed.\n\u201cHodor.\u201d Beaming genially, Hodor looked from one Frey to the other, oblivious to their taunting. \u201cHodor hodor?\u201d\nLittle Walder\u2019s mount whickered. \u201cSee, they\u2019re talking to each other. Maybe hodor means \u2018I love you\u2019 in horse.\u201d\n\u201cYou shut up, Frey.\u201d Bran could feel his color rising.\nLittle Walder spurred his horse closer, giving Hodor a bump that pushed him backward. \u201cWhat will you do if I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll set his wolf on you, cousin,\u201d warned Big Walder.\n\u201cLet him. I always wanted a wolfskin cloak.\u201d\n\u201cSummer would tear your fat head off,\u201d Bran said.\nLittle Walder banged a mailed fist against his breastplate. \u201cDoes your wolf have steel teeth, to bite through plate and mail?\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Maester Luwin\u2019s voice cracked through the clangor of the yard as loud as a thunderclap. How much he had overheard, Bran could not say\u2026 but it was enough to anger him, clearly. \u201cThese threats are unseemly, and I\u2019ll hear no more of them. Is this how you behave at the Twins, Walder Frey?\u201d\n\u201cIf I want to.\u201d Atop his courser, Little Walder gave Luwin a sullen glare, as if to say, You are only a maester, who are you to reproach a Frey of the Crossing?\n\u201cWell, it is not how Lady Stark\u2019s wards ought behave at Winterfell. What\u2019s at the root of this?\u201d The maester looked at each boy in turn. \u201cOne of you will tell me, I swear, or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe were having a jape with Hodor,\u201d confessed Big Walder. \u201cI am sorry if we offended Prince Bran. We only meant to be amusing.\u201d He at least had the grace to look abashed.\nLittle Walder only looked peevish. \u201cAnd me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only being amusing too.\u201d\nThe bald spot atop the maester\u2019s head had turned red, Bran could see; if anything, Luwin was more angry than before. \u201cA good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless,\u201d he told the Freys. \u201cI will not have you making Hodor the butt of cruel jests, do you hear me? He\u2019s a goodhearted lad, dutiful and obedient, which is more than I can say for either of you.\u201d The maester wagged a finger at Little Walder. \u201cAnd you will stay out of the godswood and away from those wolves, or answer for it.\u201d Sleeves flapping, he turned on his heels, stalked off a few paces, and glanced back. \u201cBran. Come. Lord Wyman awaits.\u201d\n\u201cHodor, go with the maester,\u201d Bran commanded.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor. His long strides caught up with the maester\u2019s furiously pumping legs on the steps of the Great Keep. Maester Luwin held the door open, and Bran hugged Hodor\u2019s neck and ducked as they went through.\n\u201cThe Walders\u2014\u201d he began.\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear no more of that, it\u2019s done.\u201d Maester Luwin looked worn-out and frayed. \u201cYou were right to defend Hodor, but you should never have been there. Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman have broken their fast already while they waited for you. Must I come myself to fetch you, as if you were a little child?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bran said, ashamed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I only wanted\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know what you wanted,\u201d Maester Luwin said, more gently. \u201cWould that it could be, Bran. Do you have any questions before we begin this audience?\u201d\n\u201cWill we talk of the war?\u201d\n\u201cYou will talk of naught.\u201d The sharpness was back in Luwin\u2019s voice. \u201cYou are still a child of eight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlmost nine!\u201d\n\u201cEight,\u201d the maester repeated firmly. \u201cSpeak nothing but courtesies unless Ser Rodrik or Lord Wyman puts you a question.\u201d\nBran nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d\n\u201cI will say nothing to Ser Rodrik of what passed between you and the Frey boys.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThey put Bran in his father\u2019s oak chair with the grey velvet cushions, behind a long plank-and-trestle table. Ser Rodrik sat on his right hand and Maester Luwin to his left, armed with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired. Bran ran a hand across the rough wood of the table and begged Lord Wyman\u2019s pardons for being late.\n\u201cWhy, no prince is ever late,\u201d the Lord of White Harbor responded amiably. \u201cThose who arrive before him have come early, that\u2019s all.\u201d Wyman Manderly had a great booming laugh. it was small wonder he could not sit a saddle; he looked as if he outweighed most horses. As windy as he was vast, he began by asking Winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he had appointed for White Harbor. The old ones had been holding back silver for King\u2019s Landing rather than paying it over to the new King in the North. \u201cKing Robb needs his own coinage as well,\u201d he declared, \u201cand White Harbor is the very place to mint it.\u201d He offered to take charge of the matter, as it please the king, and went from that to speak of how he had strengthened the port\u2019s defenses, detailing the cost of every improvement.\nIn addition to a mint, Lord Manderly also proposed to build Robb a warfleet. \u201cWe have had no strength at sea for hundreds of years, since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his father\u2019s ships. Grant me the gold and within the year I will float you sufficient galleys to take Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing both.\u201d\nBran\u2019s interest pricked up at talk of warships. No one asked him, but he thought Lord Wyman\u2019s notion a splendid one. In his mind\u2019s eye he could see them already. He wondered if a cripple had ever commanded a warship. But Ser Rodrik promised only to send the proposal on to Robb for his consideration, while Maester Luwin scratched at the parchment.\nMidday came and went. Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the kitchens, and they dined in the solar on cheese, capons, and brown oatbread. While tearing apart a bird with fat fingers, Lord Wyman made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood, who was a cousin of his. \u201cShe was born a Manderly, you know. Perhaps, when her grief has run its course, she would like to be a Manderly again, eh?\u201d He took a bite from a wing, and smiled broadly. \u201cAs it happens, I am a widower these past eight years. Past time I took another wife, don\u2019t you agree, my lords? A man does get lonely.\u201d Tossing the bones aside, he reached for a leg. \u201cOr if the lady fancies a younger lad, well, my son Wendel is unwed as well. He is off south guarding Lady Catelyn, but no doubt he will wish to take a bride on his return. A valiant boy, and jolly. just the man to teach her to laugh again, eh?\u201d He wiped a bit of grease off his chin with the sleeve of his tunic.\nBran could hear the distant clash of arms through the windows. He cared nothing about marriages. I wish I was down in the yard.\nHis lordship waited until the table had been cleared before he raised the matter of a letter he had received from Lord Tywin Lannister, who held his elder son, Ser Wylis, taken captive on the Green Fork. \u201cHe offers him back to me without ransom, provided I withdraw my levies from His Grace and vow to fight no more.\u201d\n\u201cYou will refuse him, of course,\u201d said Ser Rodrik.\n\u201cHave no fear on that count,\u201d the lord assured them. \u201cKing Robb has no more loyal servant than Wyman Manderly. I would be loath to see my son languish at Harrenhal any longer than he must, however. That is an ill place. Cursed, they say. Not that I am the sort to swallow such tales, but still, there it is. Look at what\u2019s befallen this Janos Slynt. Raised up to Lord of Harrenhal by the queen, and cast down by her brother. Shipped off to the Wall, they say. I pray some equitable exchange of captives can be arranged before too very long. I know Wylis would not want to sit out the rest of the war. Gallant, that son of mine, and fierce as a mastiff.\u201d\nBran\u2019s shoulders were stiff from sitting in the same chair by the time the audience drew to a close. And that night, as he sat to supper, a horn sounded to herald the arrival of another guest. Lady Donella Hornwood brought no tail of knights and retainers; only herself, and six tired men-at-arms with a moosehead badge on their dusty orange livery. \u201cWe are very sorry for all you have suffered, my lady,\u201d Bran said when she came before him to speak her words of greetings. Lord Hornwood had been killed in the battle on the Green Fork, their only son cut down in the Whispering Wood. \u201cWinterfell will remember.\u201d\n\u201cThat is good to know.\u201d She was a pale husk of a woman, every line of her face etched with grief. \u201cI am very weary, my lord. If I might have leave to rest, I should be thankful.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d Ser Rodrik said. \u201cThere is time enough for talk on the morrow.\u201d\nWhen the morrow came, most of the morning was given over to talk of grains and greens and salting meat. Once the maesters in their Citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn, wise men put away a portion of each harvest\u2026 though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to require much talk. Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest. At Maester Luwin\u2019s suggestion, she vowed to increase that to a quarter.\n\u201cBolton\u2019s bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort,\u201d she warned them. \u201cI hope he means to take them south to join his father at the Twins, but when I sent to ask his intent, he told me that no Bolton would be questioned by a woman. As if he were trueborn and had a right to that name.\u201d\n\u201cLord Bolton has never acknowledged the boy, so far as I know,\u201d Ser Rodrik said. \u201cI confess, I do not know him.\u201d\n\u201cFew do,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe lived with his mother until two years past, when young Domeric died and left Bolton without an heir. That was when he brought his bastard to the Dreadfort. The boy is a sly creature by all accounts, and he has a servant who is almost as cruel as he is. Reek, they call the man. It\u2019s said he never bathes. They hunt together, the Bastard and this Reek, and not for deer. I\u2019ve heard tales, things I can scarce believe, even of a Bolton. And now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the gods, the Bastard looks at my lands hungrily.\u201d\nBran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend her rights, but Ser Rodrik only said, \u201cHe may look, but should he do more I promise you there will be dire retribution. You will be safe enough, my lady\u2026 though perhaps in time, when your grief is passed, you may find it prudent to wed again.\u201d\n\u201cI am past my childbearing years, what beauty I had long fled,\u201d she replied with a tired half smile, \u201cyet men come sniffing after me as they never did when I was a maid.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not look favorably on these suitors?\u201d asked Luwin.\n\u201cI shall wed again if His Grace commands it,\u201d Lady Hornwood replied, \u201cbut Mors Crowfood is a drunken brute, and older than my father. As for my noble cousin of Manderly, my lord\u2019s bed is not large enough to hold one of his majesty, and I am surely too small and frail to lie beneath him.\u201d\nBran knew that men slept on top of women when they shared a bed. Sleeping under Lord Manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse, he imagined. Ser Rodrik gave the widow a sympathetic nod. \u201cYou will have other suitors, my lady. We shall try and find you a prospect more to your taste.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you need not look very far, ser.\u201d\nAfter she had taken her leave, Maester Luwin smiled. \u201cSer Rodrik, I do believe my lady fancies you.\u201d\nSer Rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable.\n\u201cShe was very sad,\u201d said Bran.\nSer Rodrik nodded. \u201cSad and gentle, and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years, for all her modesty. Yet a danger to the peace of your brother\u2019s realm nonetheless.\u201d\n\u201cHer?\u201d Bran said, astonished.\nMaester Luwin answered. \u201cWith no direct heir, there are sure to be many claimants contending for the Hornwood lands. The Tallharts, Flints, and Karstarks all have ties to House Hornwood through the female line, and the Glovers are fostering Lord Harys\u2019s bastard at Deepwood Motte. The Dreadfort has no claim that I know, but the lands adjoin, and Roose Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance.\u201d\nSer Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. \u201cIn such cases, her liege lord must find her a suitable match.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you marry her?\u201d Bran asked. \u201cYou said she was comely, and Beth would have a mother.\u201d\nThe old knight put a hand on Bran\u2019s arm. \u201cA kindly thought, my prince, but I am only a knight, and besides too old. I might hold her lands for a few years, but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find herself back in the same mire, and Beth\u2019s prospects might be perilous as well.\u201d\n\u201cThen let Lord Hornwood\u2019s bastard be the heir,\u201d Bran said, thinking of his half brother Jon.\nSer Rodrik said, \u201cThat would please the Glovers, and perhaps Lord Hornwood\u2019s shade as well, but I do not think Lady Hornwood would love us. The boy is not of her blood.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d said Maester Luwin, \u201cit must be considered. Lady Donella is past her fertile years, as she said herself. If not the bastard, who?\u201d\n\u201cMay I be excused?\u201d Bran could hear the squires at their swordplay in the yard below, the ring of steel on steel.\n\u201cAs you will, my prince,\u201d said Ser Rodrik. \u201cYou did well.\u201d Bran flushed with pleasure. Being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared, and since Lady Hornwood had been so much briefer than Lord Manderly, he even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with Summer. He liked to spend time with his wolf every day, when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed it.\nNo sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than Summer emerged from under an oak, almost as if he had known they were coming. Bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching from the undergrowth as well. \u201cShaggy,\u201d he called. \u201cHere, Shaggydog. To me.\u201d But Rickon\u2019s wolf vanished as swiftly as he\u2019d appeared.\nHodor knew Bran\u2019s favorite place, so he took him to the edge of the pool beneath the great spread of the heart tree, where Lord Eddard used to kneel to pray. Ripples were running across the surface of the water when they arrived, making the reflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance. There was no wind, though. For an instant Bran was baffled.\nAnd then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so sudden that even Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing \u201cHodor, Hodor\u201d in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears. \u201cHow can you swim in there?\u201d he asked Osha. \u201cIsn\u2019t it cold?\u201d\n\u201cAs a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like the cold.\u201d Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping. She was naked, her skin bumpy with gooseprickles. Summer crept close and sniffed at her. \u201cI wanted to touch the bottom.\u201d\n\u201cI never knew there was a bottom.\u201d\n\u201cMight be there isn\u2019t.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWhat are you staring at, boy? Never seen a woman before?\u201d\n\u201cI have so.\u201d Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he\u2019d seen serving women in the hot pools too. Osha looked different, though, hard and sharp instead of soft and curvy. Her legs were all sinew, her breasts flat as two empty purses. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of scars.\u201d\n\u201cEvery one hard earned.\u201d She picked up her brown shift, shook some leaves off of it, and pulled it down over her head.\n\u201cFighting giants?\u201d Osha claimed there were still giants beyond the Wall. One day maybe I\u2019ll even see one\u2026\n\u201cFighting men.\u201d She belted herself with a length of rope. \u201cBlack crows, oft as not. Killed me one too,\u201d she said, shaking out her hair. It had grown since she\u2019d come to Winterfell, well down past her ears. She looked softer than the woman who had once tried to rob and kill him in the wolfswood. \u201cHeard some yattering in the kitchen today about you and them Freys.\u201d\n\u201cWho? What did they say?\u201d\nShe gave him a sour grin. \u201cThat it\u2019s a fool boy who mocks a giant, and a mad world when a cripple has to defend him.\u201d\n\u201cHodor never knew they were mocking him,\u201d Bran said. \u201cAnyhow he never fights.\u201d He remembered once when he was little, going to the market square with his mother and Septa Mordane. They brought Hodor to carry for them, but he had wandered away, and when they found him some boys had him backed into an alley, poking him with sticks. \u201cHodor!\u201d he kept shouting, cringing and covering himself, but he had never raised a hand against his tormentors. \u201cSepton Chayle says he has a gentle spirit.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, \u201cand hands strong enough to twist a man\u2019s head off his shoulders, if he takes a mind to. All the same, he better watch his back around that Walder. Him and you both. The big one they call little, it comes to me he\u2019s well named. Big outside, little inside, and mean down to the bones.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d never dare hurt me. He\u2019s scared of Summer, no matter what he says.\u201d\n\u201cThen might be he\u2019s not so stupid as he seems.\u201d Osha was always wary around the direwolves. The day she was taken, Summer and Grey Wind between them had torn three wildlings to bloody pieces. \u201cOr might be he is. And that tastes of trouble too.\u201d She tied up her hair. \u201cYou have more of them wolf dreams?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He did not like to talk about the dreams.\n\u201cA prince should lie better than that.\u201d Osha laughed. \u201cWell, your dreams are your business. Mine\u2019s in the kitchens, and I\u2019d best be getting back before Gage starts to shouting and waving that big wooden spoon of his. By your leave, my prince.\u201d\nShe should never have talked about the wolf dreams, Bran thought as Hodor carried him up the steps to his bedchamber. He fought against sleep as long as he could, but in the end it took him as it always did. On this night he dreamed of the weirwood. it was looking at him with its deep red eyes, calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth, and from its pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice as sharp as swords.\nThe blast of horns woke him. Bran pushed himself onto his side, grateful for the reprieve. He heard horses and boisterous shouting. More guests have come, and half-drunk by the noise of them. Grasping his bars he pulled himself from the bed and over to the window seat. On their banner was a giant in shattered chains that told him that these were Umber men, down from the northlands beyond the Last River.\nThe next day two of them came together to audience; the Greatjon\u2019s uncles, blustery men in the winter of their days with beards as white as the bearskin cloaks they wore. A crow had once taken Mors for dead and pecked out his eye, so he wore a chunk of dragonglass in its stead. As Old Nan told the tale, he\u2019d grabbed the crow in his fist and bitten its head off, so they named him Crowfood. She would never tell Bran why his gaunt brother Hother was called Whoresbane.\nNo sooner had they been seated than Mors asked for leave to wed Lady Hornwood. \u201cThe Greatjon\u2019s the Young Wolf\u2019s strong right hand, all know that to be true. Who better to protect the widow\u2019s lands than an Umber, and what Umber better than me?\u201d\n\u201cLady Donella is still grieving,\u201d Maester Luwin said.\n\u201cI have a cure for grief under my furs.\u201d Mors laughed. Ser Rodrik thanked him courteously and promised to bring the matter before the lady and the king.\nHother wanted ships. \u201cThere\u2019s wildlings stealing down from the north, more than I\u2019ve ever seen before. They cross the Bay of Seals in little boats and wash up on our shores. The crows in Eastwatch are too few to stop them, and they go to ground quick as weasels. It\u2019s longships we need, aye, and strong men to sail them. The Greatjon took too many. Half our harvest is gone to seed for want of arms to swing the scythes.\u201d\nSer Rodrik pulled at his whiskers. \u201cYou have forests of tall pine and old oak. Lord Manderly has shipwrights and sailors in plenty. Together you ought to be able to float enough longships to guard both your coasts.\u201d\n\u201cManderly?\u201d Mors Umber snorted. \u201cThat great waddling sack of suet? His own people mock him as Lord Lamprey, I\u2019ve heard. The man can scarce walk. If you stuck a sword in his belly, ten thousand eels would wriggle out.\u201d\n\u201cHe is fat,\u201d Ser Rodrik admitted, \u201cbut he is not stupid. You will work with him, or the king will know the reason why.\u201d And to Bran\u2019s astonishment, the truculent Umbers agreed to do as he commanded, though not without grumbling.\nWhile they were sitting at audience, the Glover men arrived from Deepwood Motte, and a large party of Tallharts from Torrhen\u2019s Square. Galbart and Robett Glover had left Deepwood in the hands of Robett\u2019s wife, but it was their steward who came to Winterfell. \u201cMy lady begs that you excuse her absence. Her babes are still too young for such a journey, and she was loath to leave them.\u201d Bran soon realized that it was the steward, not Lady Glover, who truly ruled at Deepwood Motte. The man allowed that he was at present setting aside only a tenth of his harvest. A hedge wizard had told him there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in, he claimed. Maester Luwin had a number of choice things to say about hedge wizards. Ser Rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth, and questioned the steward closely about Lord Hornwood\u2019s bastard, the boy Larence Snow. In the north, all highborn bastards took the surname Snow. This lad was near twelve, and the steward praised his wits and courage.\n\u201cYour notion about the bastard may have merit, Bran,\u201d Maester Luwin said after. \u201cOne day you will be a good lord for Winterfell, I think.\u201d\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t.\u201d Bran knew he would never be a lord, no more than he could be a knight. \u201cRobb\u2019s to marry some Frey girl, you told me so yourself, and the Walders say the same. He\u2019ll have sons, and they\u2019ll be the lords of Winterfell after him, not me.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be so, Bran,\u201d Ser Rodrik said, \u201cbut I was wed three times and my wives gave me daughters. Now only Beth remains to me. My brother Martyn fathered four strong sons, yet only Jory lived to be a man. When he was slain, Martyn\u2019s line died with him. When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.\u201d\nLeobald Tallhart had his turn the following day. He spoke of weather portents and the slack wits of smallfolk, and told how his nephew itched for battle. \u201cBenfred has raised his own company of lances. Boys, none older than nineteen years, but every one thinks he\u2019s another young wolf. When I told them they were only young rabbits, they laughed at me. Now they call themselves the Wild Hares and gallop about the country with rabbitskins tied to the ends of their lances, singing songs of chivalry.\u201d\nBran thought that sounded grand. He remembered Benfred Tallhart, a big bluff loud boy who had often visited Winterfell with his father, Ser Helman, and had been friendly with Robb and with Theon Greyjoy. But Ser Rodrik was clearly displeased by what he heard. \u201cIf the king were in need of more men, he would send for them,\u201d he said. \u201cInstruct your nephew that he is to remain at Torrhen\u2019s Square, as his lord father commanded.\u201d\n\u201cI will, ser,\u201d said Leobald, and only then raised the matter of Lady Hornwood. Poor thing, with no husband to defend her lands nor son to inherit. His own lady wife was a Hornwood, sister to the late Lord Halys, doubtless they recalled. \u201cAn empty hall is a sad one. I had a thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as her own. Beren is near ten, a likely lad, and her own nephew. He would cheer her, I am certain, and perhaps he would even take the name Hornwood\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf he were named heir?\u201d suggested Maester Luwin.\n\u201c\u2026so the House might continue,\u201d finished Leobald.\nBran knew what to say. \u201cThank you for the notion, my lord,\u201d he blurted out before Ser Rodrik could speak. \u201cWe will bring the matter to my brother Robb. Oh, and Lady Hornwood.\u201d\nLeobald seemed surprised that he had spoken. \u201cI\u2019m grateful, my prince,\u201d he said, but Bran saw pity in his pale blue eyes, mingled perhaps with a little gladness that the cripple was, after all, not his son. For a moment he hated the man.\nMaester Luwin liked him better, though. \u201cBeren Tallhart may well be our best answer,\u201d he told them when Leobald had gone. \u201cBy blood he is half Hornwood. If he takes his uncle\u2019s name\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026he will still be a boy,\u201d said Ser Rodrik, \u201cand hard-pressed to hold his lands against the likes of Mors Umber or this bastard of Roose Bolton\u2019s. We must think on this carefully. Robb should have our best counsel before he makes his decision.\u201d\n\u201cIt may come down to practicalities,\u201d said Maester Luwin. \u201cWhich lord he most needs to court. The riverlands are part of his realm, he may wish to cement the alliance by wedding Lady Hornwood to one of the lords of the Trident. A Blackwood, perhaps, or a Frey\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLady Hornwood can have one of our Freys,\u201d said Bran. \u201cShe can have both of them if she likes.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not kind, my prince,\u201d Ser Rodrik chided gently.\nNeither are the Walders. Scowling, Bran stared down at the table and said nothing.\nIn the days that followed, ravens arrived from other lordly houses, bearing regrets. The bastard of the Dreadfort would not be joining them, the Mormonts and Karstarks had all gone south with Robb, Lord Locke was too old to dare the journey, Lady Flint was heavy with child, there was sickness at Widow\u2019s Watch. Finally all of the principal vassals of House Stark had been heard from save for Howland Reed the crannogman, who had not set foot outside his swamps for many a year, and the Cerwyns whose castle lay a half day\u2019s ride from Winterfell. Lord Cerwyn was a captive of the Lannisters, but his son, a lad of fourteen, arrived one bright, blustery morning at the head of two dozen lances. Bran was riding Dancer around the yard when they came through the gate. He trotted over to greet them. Cley Cerwyn had always been a friend to Bran and his brothers.\n\u201cGood morrow, Bran,\u201d Cley called out cheerfully. \u201cOr must I call you Prince Bran now?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you want.\u201d\nCley laughed. \u201cWhy not? Everyone else is a king or prince these days. Did Stannis write Winterfell as well?\u201d\n\u201cStannis? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a king now too,\u201d Cley confided. \u201cHe says Queen Cersei bedded her brother, so Joffrey is a bastard.\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey the Illborn,\u201d one of the Cerwyn knights growled. \u201cSmall wonder he\u2019s faithless, with the Kingslayer for a father.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said another, \u201cthe gods hate incest. Look how they brought down the Targaryens.\u201d\nFor a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe. A giant hand was crushing his chest. He felt as though he was falling, and clutched desperately at Dancer\u2019s reins.\nHis terror must have shown on his face. \u201cBran?\u201d Cley Cerwyn said. \u201cAre you unwell? It\u2019s only another king.\u201d\n\u201cRobb will beat him too.\u201d He turned Dancer\u2019s head toward the stables, oblivious to the puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave him. His blood was roaring in his ears, and had he not been strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen.\nThat night Bran prayed to his father\u2019s gods for dreamless sleep. If the gods heard, they mocked his hopes, for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream.\n\u201cFly or die!\u201d cried the three-eyed crow as it pecked at him. He wept and pleaded but the crow had no pity. It put out his left eye and then his right, and when he was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow, driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull. He screamed until he was certain his lungs must burst. The pain was an axe splitting his head apart, but when the crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain, Bran could see again. What he saw made him gasp in fear. He was clinging to a tower miles high, and his fingers were slipping, nails scrabbling at the stone, his legs dragging him down, stupid useless dead legs. \u201cHelp me!\u201d he cried. A golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up. \u201cThe things I do for love,\u201d he murmured softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air.",

      "content": "Tyrion\n\u201cI do not sleep as I did when I was younger,\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle told him, by way of apology for the dawn meeting. \u201cI would sooner be up, though the world be dark, than lie restless abed, fretting on tasks undone,\u201d he said\u2014though his heavy-lidded eyes made him look half-asleep as he said it.\nIn the airy chambers beneath the rookery, his girl served them boiled eggs, stewed plums, and porridge, while Pycelle served the pontifications. \u201cIn these sad times, when so many hunger, I think it only fitting to keep my table spare.\u201d\n\u201cCommendable,\u201d Tyrion admitted, breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly of the Grand Maester\u2019s bald spotted head. \u201cI take a different view. If there is food I eat it, in case there is none on the morrow.\u201d He smiled. \u201cTell me, are your ravens early risers as well?\u201d\nPycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest. \u201cTo be sure. Shall I send for quill and ink after we have eaten?\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge, twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends. \u201cSend your girl away, so we can talk.\u201d\n\u201cLeave us, child,\u201d Pycelle commanded. The serving girl hurried from the room. \u201cThese letters, now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor the eyes of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.\u201d Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite. It wanted salt. \u201cOne letter, in two copies. Send your swiftest birds. The matter is of great import.\u201d\n\u201cI shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast.\u201d\n\u201cDispatch them now. Stewed plums will keep. The realm may not. Lord Renly is leading his host up the roseroad, and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone.\u201d\nPycelle blinked. \u201cIf my lord prefers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe does.\u201d\n\u201cI am here to serve.\u201d The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly. It was a heavy thing, a dozen maester\u2019s collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones. And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals.\nPycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums\u2014overcooked and watery, to his taste\u2014before the sound of wings prompted him to rise. He spied the raven, dark in the dawn sky, and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room.\nThe maester\u2019s medicines made an impressive display; dozens of pots sealed with wax, hundreds of stoppered vials, as many milkglass bottles, countless jars of dried herbs, each container neatly labeled in Pycelle\u2019s precise hand. An orderly mind, Tyrion reflected, and indeed, once you puzzled out the arrangement, it was easy to see that every potion had its place. And such interesting things. He noted sweetsleep and nightshade, milk of the poppy, the tears of Lys, powdered greycap, wolfsbane and demon\u2019s dance, basilisk venom, blindeye, widow\u2019s blood\u2026\nStanding on his toes and straining upward, he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf. When he read the label, he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve.\nHe was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping down the stairs. \u201cIt is done, my lord.\u201d The old man seated himself. \u201cA matter like this\u2026 best done promptly, indeed, indeed\u2026 of great import, you say?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d The porridge was too thick, Tyrion felt, and wanted butter and honey. To be sure, butter and honey were seldom seen in King\u2019s Landing of late, though Lord Gyles kept them well supplied in the castle. Half of the food they ate these days came from his lands or Lady Tanda\u2019s. Rosby and Stokeworth lay near the city to the north, and were yet untouched by war.\n\u201cThe Prince of Dorne, himself. Might I ask\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBest not.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d Pycelle\u2019s curiosity was so ripe that Tyrion could almost taste it. \u201cMayhaps\u2026 the king\u2019s council\u2026\u201d\nTyrion tapped his wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl. \u201cThe council exists to advise the king, Maester.\u201d\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said Pycelle, \u201cand the king\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014is a boy of thirteen. I speak with his voice.\u201d\n\u201cSo you do. Indeed. The King\u2019s Own Hand. Yet\u2026 your most gracious sister, our Queen Regent, she\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026bears a great weight upon those lovely white shoulders of hers. I have no wish to add to her burdens. Do you?\u201d Tyrion cocked his head and gave the Grand Maester an inquiring stare.\nPycelle dropped his gaze back to his food. Something about Tyrion\u2019s mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm; knowing that, he made good use of them. \u201cAh,\u201d the old man muttered into his plums. \u201cDoubtless you have the right of it, my lord. It is most considerate of you to\u2026 spare her this\u2026 burden.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the sort of fellow I am.\u201d Tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge. \u201cConsiderate. Cersei is my own sweet sister, after all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a woman, to be sure,\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle said. \u201cA most uncommon woman, and yet\u2026 it is no small thing, to tend to all the cares of the realm, despite the frailty of her sex\u2026\u201d\nOh, yes, she\u2019s a frail dove, just ask Eddard Stark. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you share my concern. And I thank you for the hospitality of your table. But a long day awaits.\u201d He swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair. \u201cBe so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne? \u201c\n\u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd only me?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 to be sure.\u201d Pycelle\u2019s spotted hand was clutching at his beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope. It made Tyrion\u2019s heart glad. One, he thought.\nHe waddled out into the lower bailey; his stunted legs complained of the steps. The sun was well up now, and the castle was stirring. Guardsmen walked the walls, and knights and men-at-arms were training with blunted weapons. Nearby, Bronn sat on the lip of a well. A pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them, but the sellsword never looked. \u201cBronn, I despair of you.\u201d Tyrion gestured at the wenches. \u201cWith sweet sights like that before you, all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt I want,\u201d Bronn answered, \u201cbut one day my life may hang on how close I\u2019ve watched your louts.\u201d He stood. \u201cWho\u2019s the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield?\u201d\n\u201cSome hedge knight. Tallad, he names himself. Why?\u201d\nBronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s the best of them. But watch him, he falls into a rhythm, delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThat will be the death of him, the day he faces me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s pledged to Joffrey; he\u2019s not like to face you.\u201d They set off across the bailey, Bronn matching his long stride to Tyrion\u2019s short one. These days the sellsword was looking almost respectable. His dark hair was washed and brushed, he was freshly shaved, and he wore the black breastplate of an officer of the City Watch. From his shoulders trailed a cloak of Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands. Tyrion had made him a gift of it when he named him captain of his personal guard. \u201cHow many supplicants do we have today?\u201d he inquired.\n\u201cThirty odd,\u201d answered Bronn. \u201cMost with complaints, or wanting something, as ever. Your pet was back.\u201d\nHe groaned. \u201cLady Tanda?\u201d\n\u201cHer page. She invites you to sup with her again. There\u2019s to be a haunch of venison, she says, a brace of stuffed geese sauced with mulberries, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014her daughter,\u201d Tyrion finished sourly. Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep, Lady Tanda had been stalking him, armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies, wild boars, and savory cream stews. Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for her daughter Lollys, a large, soft, dim-witted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirty-and-three. \u201cSend her my regrets.\u201d\n\u201cNo taste for stuffed goose?\u201d Bronn grinned evilly.\n\u201cPerhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid. Or better still, send Shagga.\u201d\n\u201cShagga\u2019s more like to eat the maid and marry the goose,\u201d observed Bronn. \u201cAnyway, Lollys outweighs him.\u201d\n\u201cThere is that,\u201d Tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway between two towers. \u201cWho else wants me?\u201d\nThe sellsword grew more serious. \u201cThere\u2019s a moneylender from Braavos, holding fancy papers and the like, requests to see the king about payment on some loan.\u201d\n\u201cAs if Joff could count past twenty. Send the man to Littlefinger, he\u2019ll find a way to put him off. Next?\u201d\n\u201cA lordling down from the Trident, says your father\u2019s men burned his keep, raped his wife, and killed all his peasants.\u201d\n\u201cI believe they call that war.\u201d Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane\u2019s work, or that of Ser Amory Lorch or his father\u2019s other pet hellhound, the Qohorik. \u201cWhat does he want of Joffrey?\u201d\n\u201cNew peasants,\u201d Bronn said. \u201cHe walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make time for him on the morrow.\u201d Whether truly loyal or merely desperate, a compliant river lord might have his uses. \u201cSee that he\u2019s given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal. Send him a new pair of boots as well, good ones, courtesy of King Joffrey.\u201d A show of generosity never hurt.\nBronn gave a curt nod. \u201cThere\u2019s also a great gaggle of bakers, butchers, and greengrocers clamoring to be heard.\u201d\n\u201cI told them last time, I have nothing to give them.\u201d Only a thin trickle of food was coming into King\u2019s Landing, most of it earmarked for castle and garrison. Prices had risen sickeningly high on greens, roots, flour, and fruit, and Tyrion did not want to think about what sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles of the pot-shops down in Flea Bottom. Fish, he hoped. They still had the river and the sea\u2026 at least until Lord Stannis sailed.\n\u201cThey want protection. Last night a baker was roasted in his own oven. The mob claimed he charged too much for bread.\u201d\n\u201cDid he?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not apt to deny it.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t eat him, did they?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cNext time they will,\u201d Tyrion said grimly. \u201cI give them what protection I can. The gold cloaks\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey claim there were gold cloaks in the mob,\u201d Bronn said. \u201cThey\u2019re demanding to speak to the king himself.\u201d\n\u201cFools.\u201d Tyrion had sent them off with regrets; his nephew would send them off with whips and spears. He was half-tempted to allow it\u2026 but no, he dare not. Soon or late, some enemy would march on King\u2019s Landing, and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors within the city walls. \u201cTell them King Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them.\u201d\n\u201cThey want bread, not promises.\u201d\n\u201cIf I give them bread today, on the morrow I\u2019ll have twice as many at the gates. Who else?\u201d\n\u201cA black brother down from the Wall. The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar.\u201d\nTyrion smiled wanly. \u201cI\u2019m surprised no one ate it. I suppose I ought to see him. It\u2019s not Yoren, perchance?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Some knight. Thorne.\u201d\n\u201cSer Alliser Thorne?\u201d Of all the black brothers he\u2019d met on the Wall, Tyrion Lannister had liked Ser Alliser Thorne the least. A bitter, mean-spirited man with too great a sense of his own worth. \u201cCome to think on it, I don\u2019t believe I care to see Ser Alliser just now. Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year, and let his hand rot a little more.\u201d\nBronn snorted laughter and went his way, while Tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps. As he limped across the outer yard, he heard the portcullis rattling up. His sister and a large party were waiting by the main gate.\nMounted on her white palfrey, Cersei towered high above him, a goddess in green. \u201cBrother,\u201d she called out, not warmly. The queen had not been pleased by the way he\u2019d dealt with Janos Slynt.\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Tyrion bowed politely. \u201cYou look lovely this morning.\u201d Her crown was gold, her cloak ermine. Her retinue sat their mounts behind her: Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard, wearing white scale and his favorite scowl; Ser Balon Swann, bow slung from his silver-inlay saddle; Lord Gyles Rosby, his wheezing cough worse than ever; Hallyne the Pyromancer of the Alchemists\u2019 Guild; and the queen\u2019s newest favorite, their cousin Ser Lancel Lannister, her late husband\u2019s squire upjumped to knight at his widow\u2019s insistence. Vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort. \u201cWhere are you bound this day, sister?\u201d Tyrion asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires. I would not have it thought that all of us are as indifferent to the city\u2019s defense as you seem to be.\u201d Cersei fixed him with those clear green eyes of hers, beautiful even in their contempt. \u201cI am informed that Renly Baratheon has marched from Highgarden. He is making his way up the roseroad, with all his strength behind him.\u201d\n\u201cVarys gave me the same report.\u201d\n\u201cHe could be here by the full moon.\u201d\n\u201cNot at his present leisurely pace,\u201d Tyrion assured her. \u201cHe feasts every night in a different castle, and holds court at every crossroads he passes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd every day, more men rally to his banners. His host is now said to be a hundred thousand strong.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems rather high.\u201d\n\u201cHe has the power of Storm\u2019s End and Highgarden behind him, you little fool,\u201d Cersei snapped down at him. \u201cAll the Tyrell bannermen but for the Redwynes, and you have me to thank for that. So long as I hold those poxy twins of his, Lord Paxter will squat on the Arbor and count himself fortunate to be out of it.\u201d\n\u201cA pity you let the Knight of Flowers slip through your pretty fingers. Still, Renly has other concerns besides us. Our father at Harrenhal, Robb Stark at Riverrun\u2026 were I he, I would do much as he is doing. Make my progress, flaunt my power for the realm to see, watch, wait. Let my rivals contend while I bide my own sweet time. If Stark defeats us, the south will fall into Renly\u2019s hands like a windfall from the gods, and he\u2019ll not have lost a man. And if it goes the other way, he can descend on us while we are weakened.\u201d\nCersei was not appeased. \u201cI want you to make Father bring his army to King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\nWhere it will serve no purpose but to make you feel safe. \u201cWhen have I ever been able to make Father do anything?\u201d\nShe ignored the question. \u201cAnd when do you plan to free Jaime? He\u2019s worth a hundred of you.\u201d\nTyrion grinned crookedly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Lady Stark, I beg you. We don\u2019t have a hundred of me to trade.\u201d\n\u201cFather must have been mad to send you. You\u2019re worse than useless.\u201d The queen jerked on her reins and wheeled her palfrey around. She rode out the gate at a brisk trot, ermine cloak streaming behind her. Her retinue hastened after.\nIn truth, Renly Baratheon did not frighten Tyrion half so much as his brother Stannis did. Renly was beloved of the commons, but he had never before led men in war. Stannis was otherwise: hard, cold, inexorable. if only they had some way of knowing what was happening on Dragonstone\u2026 but not one of the fisherfolk he had paid to spy out the island had ever returned, and even the informers the eunuch claimed to have placed in Stannis\u2019s household had been ominously silent. The striped hulls of Lysene war galleys had been seen offshore, though, and Varys had reports from Myr of sellsail captains taking service with Dragonstone. If Stannis attacks by sea while his brother Renly storms the gates, they\u2019ll soon be mounting Joffrey\u2019s head on a spike. Worse, mine will be beside him. A depressing thought. He ought to make plans to get Shae safely out of the city, should the worst seem likely.\nPodrick Payne stood at the door of his solar, studying the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s inside,\u201d he announced to Tyrion\u2019s belt buckle. \u201cYour solar. My lord. Sorry.\u201d\nTyrion sighed. \u201cLook at me, Pod. It unnerves me when you talk to my codpiece, especially when I\u2019m not wearing one. Who is inside my solar?\u201d\n\u201cLord Littlefinger.\u201d Podrick managed a quick look at his face, then hastily dropped his eyes. \u201cI meant, Lord Petyr. Lord Baelish. The master of coin. \u201c\n\u201cYou make him sound a crowd.\u201d The boy hunched down as if struck, making Tyrion feel absurdly guilty.\nLord Petyr was seated on his window seat, languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape, one gloved hand resting on his knee. \u201cThe king is fighting hares with a crossbow,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hares are winning. Come see.\u201d\nTyrion had to stand on his toes to get a look. A dead hare lay on the ground below; another, long ears twitching, was about to expire from the bolt in his side. Spent quarrels lay strewn across the hard-packed earth like straws scattered by a storm. \u201cNow!\u201d Joff shouted. The gamesman released the hare he was holding, and he went bounding off. Joffrey jerked the trigger on the crossbow. The bolt missed by two feet. The hare stood on his hind legs and twitched his nose at the king. Cursing, Joff spun the wheel to winch back his string, but the animal was gone before he was loaded. \u201cAnother!\u201d The gamesman reached into the hutch. This one made a brown streak against the stones, while Joffrey\u2019s hurried shot almost took Ser Preston in the groin.\nLittlefinger turned away. \u201cBoy, are you fond of potted hare?\u201d he asked Podrick Payne.\nPod stared at the visitor\u2019s boots, lovely things of red-dyed leather ornamented with black scrollwork. \u201cTo eat, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cInvest in pots,\u201d Littlefinger advised. \u201cHares will soon overrun the castle. We\u2019ll be eating hare thrice a day.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than rats on a skewer,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cPod, leave us. Unless Lord Petyr would care for some refreshment?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, but no.\u201d Littlefinger flashed his mocking smile. \u201cDrink with the dwarf, it\u2019s said, and you wake up walking the Wall. Black brings out my unhealthy pallor.\u201d\nHave no fear, my lord, Tyrion thought, it\u2019s not the Wall I have in mind for you. He seated himself in a high chair piled with cushions and said, \u201cYou look very elegant today, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m wounded. I strive to look elegant every day.\u201d\n\u201cIs the doublet new?\u201d\n\u201cIt is. You\u2019re most observant.\u201d\n\u201cPlum and yellow. Are those the colors of your House?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out, or so I\u2019ve found.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a handsome knife as well.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d There was mischief in Littlefinger\u2019s eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, as if he had never seen it before. \u201cValyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though. It\u2019s yours, if you would like it.\u201d\n\u201cMine?\u201d Tyrion gave him a long look. \u201cNo. I think not. Never mine.\u201d He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him.\nIf ever truly a man had armored himself in gold, it was Petyr Baelish, not Jaime Lannister. Jaime\u2019s famous armor was but gilded steel, but Littlefinger, ah\u2026 Tyrion had learned a few things about sweet Petyr, to his growing disquiet.\nTen years ago, Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs, where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king\u2019s other collectors. King Robert had been a prodigious spender. A man like Petyr Baelish, who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third, was invaluable to his Hand. Littlefinger\u2019s rise had been arrow-swift. Within three years of his coming to court, he was master of coin and a member of the small council, and today the crown\u2019s revenues were ten times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor\u2026 though the crown\u2019s debts had grown vast as well. A master juggler was Petyr Baelish.\nOh, he was clever. He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault, no. He paid the king\u2019s debts in promises, and put the king\u2019s gold to work. He bought wagons, shops, ships, houses. He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce. He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys, stored it, moved it, dyed it, sold it. The golden dragons bred and multiplied, and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings.\nAnd in the process, he moved his own men into place. The Keepers of the Keys were his, all four. The King\u2019s Counter and the King\u2019s Scales were men he\u2019d named. The officers in charge of all three mints. Harbormasters, tax farmers, customs sergeants, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, wine factors; nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger. They were men of middling birth, by and large; merchants\u2019 sons, lesser lordlings, sometimes even foreigners, but judging from their results, far more able than their highborn predecessors.\nNo one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone\u2019s friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage.\nBut do I dare touch him? Tyrion wondered. Even if he is a traitor? He was not at all certain he could, least of all now, while the war raged. Given time, he could replace Littlefinger\u2019s men with his own in key positions, but\u2026\nA shout rang up from the yard. \u201cAh, His Grace has killed a hare,\u201d Lord Baelish observed.\n\u201cNo doubt a slow one,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cMy lord, you were fostered at Riverrun. I\u2019ve heard it said that you grew close to the Tullys.\u201d\n\u201cYou might say so. The girls especially.\u201d\n\u201cHow close?\u201d\n\u201cI had their maidenhoods. Is that close enough?\u201d\nThe lie\u2014Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie\u2014was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it. Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied? About her defloration, and the dagger as well? The longer he lived, the more Tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true. \u201cLord Hoster\u2019s daughters do not love me,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make. Yet coming from you, the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears. \u201c\n\u201cThat would depend on the words. If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother, waste someone else\u2019s time. Joffrey will never surrender his plaything, and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl.\u201d\n\u201cI mean to have Arya as well. I have men searching.\u201d\n\u201cSearching is not finding.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, my lord. In any case, it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway. For her, I have a sweeter offer.\u201d\n\u201cLysa is more tractable than Catelyn, true\u2026 but also more fearful, and I understand she hates you.\u201d\n\u201cShe believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that Id murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cIf I gave her Jon Arryn\u2019s true killer, she might think more kindly of me.\u201d\nThat made Littlefinger sit up. \u201cTrue killer? I confess, you make me curious. Who do you propose?\u201d\nIt was Tyrion\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cGifts I give my friends, freely. Lysa Arryn would need to understand that.\u201d\n\u201cIs it her friendship you require, or her swords?\u201d\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\nLittlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard. \u201cLysa has woes of her own. Clansmen raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon, in greater numbers than ever before\u2026 and better armed.\u201d\n\u201cDistressing,\u201d said Tyrion Lannister, who had armed them. \u201cI could help her with that. A word from me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would this word cost her?\u201d\n\u201cI want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king, to swear fealty, and to\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014make war on the Starks and Tullys?\u201d Littlefinger shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s the roach in your pudding, Lannister. Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun.\u201d\n\u201cNor would I ask it. We have no lack of enemies. I\u2019ll use her power to oppose Lord Renly, or Lord Stannis, should he stir from Dragonstone. In return, I will give her justice for Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale. I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East, as his father was before him.\u201d I want to see him fly, a boy\u2019s voice whispered faintly in memory. \u201cAnd to seal the bargain, I will give her my niece.\u201d\nHe had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish\u2019s grey-green eyes. \u201cMyrcella?\u201d\n\u201cWhen she comes of age, she can wed little Lord Robert. Until such time, she\u2019ll be Lady Lysa\u2019s ward at the Eyrie.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy?\u201d When Tyrion shrugged, Littlefinger burst into laughter. \u201cI thought not. You\u2019re a dangerous little man, Lannister. Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa.\u201d Again the sly smile, the mischief in his glance. \u201cIf I cared to.\u201d\nTyrion nodded, waiting, knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Lord Petyr continued after a pause, utterly unabashed, \u201cwhat\u2019s in your pot for me?\u201d\n\u201cHarrenhal.\u201d\nIt was interesting to watch his face. Lord Petyr\u2019s father had been the smallest of small lords, his grandfather a landless hedge knight; by birth, he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers. Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms, its lands broad and rich and fertile, its great castle as formidable as any in the realm\u2026 and so large as to dwarf Riverrun, where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully, only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to Lord Hoster\u2019s daughter.\nLittlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape, but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat\u2019s eyes. I have him, he knew. \u201cHarrenhal is cursed,\u201d Lord Petyr said after a moment, trying to sound bored.\n\u201cThen raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself. You\u2019ll have no lack of coin. I mean to make you liege lord of the Trident. These river lords have proven they cannot be trusted. Let them do you fealty for their lands.\u201d\n\u201cEven the Tullys?\u201d\n\u201cIf there are any Tullys left when we are done.\u201d\nLittlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb. He was trying to watch for bees, but the honey was so sweet. \u201cHarrenhal and all its lands and incomes,\u201d he mused. \u201cWith a stroke, you\u2019d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm. Not that I\u2019m ungrateful, my lord, but\u2014why?\u201d\n\u201cYou served my sister well in the matter of the succession.\u201d\n\u201cAs did Janos Slynt. On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed\u2014only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use.\u201d\nTyrion laughed. \u201cYou have me, my lord. What can I say? I need you to deliver the Lady Lysa. I did not need Janos Slynt.\u201d He gave a crooked shrug. \u201cI\u2019d sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne. What could be plainer?\u201d\n\u201cWhat indeed. You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage?\u201d\n\u201cI have little doubt you\u2019ll be equal to the task.\u201d\n\u201cI once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman, the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it.\u201d Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into Tyrion\u2019s mismatched eyes. \u201cGive me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown.\u201d\n\u201cThat will do nicely.\u201d\nHis guest rose. \u201cThis has been quite the pleasant morning, Lannister. And profitable\u2026 for both of us, I trust.\u201d He bowed, his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door.\nTwo, thought Tyrion.\nHe went up to his bedchamber to await Varys, who would soon be making an appearance. Evenfall, he guessed. Perhaps as late as moonrise, though he hoped not. He hoped to visit Shae tonight. He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door. \u201cYou are a cruel man, to make the Grand Maester squirm so,\u201d the eunuch scolded. \u201cThe man cannot abide a secret.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a crow I hear, calling the raven black? Or would you sooner not hear what I\u2019ve proposed to Doran Martell?\u201d\nVarys giggled. \u201cPerhaps my little birds have told me.\u201d\n\u201cHave they, indeed?\u201d He wanted to hear this. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cThe Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars. Doran Martell has called his banners, but no more. His hatred for House Lannister is well known, and it is commonly thought he will join Lord Renly. You wish to dissuade him.\u201d\n\u201cAll this is obvious,\u201d said Tyrion.\n\u201cThe only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance. The prince is a sentimental man, and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe.\u201d\n\u201cMy father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition\u2026 and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council, now that Lord Janos has taken the black.\u201d\n\u201cA council seat is not to be despised,\u201d Varys admitted, \u201cyet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sister\u2019s murder?\u201d\n\u201cWhy forget?\u201d Tyrion smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve promised to deliver his sister\u2019s killers, alive or dead, as he prefers. After the war is done, to be sure.\u201d\nVarys gave him a shrewd look. \u201cMy little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a\u2026 certain name\u2026 when they came for her.\u201d\n\u201cIs a secret still a secret if everyone knows it?\u201d In Casterly Rock, it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe. They said he had raped the princess with her son\u2019s blood and brains still on his hands.\n\u201cThis secret is your lord father\u2019s sworn man.\u201d\n\u201cMy father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog.\u201d\nVarys stroked a powdered cheek. \u201cAnd if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRobert Baratheon led the rebellion. All commands came from him, in the end.\u201d\n\u201cRobert was not at King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\n\u201cNeither was Doran Martell.\u201d\n\u201cSo. Blood for his pride, a chair for his ambition. Gold and land, that goes without saying. A sweet offer\u2026 yet sweets can be poisoned. If I were the prince, something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb. Some token of good faith, some sure safeguard against betrayal.\u201d Varys smiled his slimiest smile. \u201cWhich one will you give him, I wonder?\u201d\nTyrion sighed. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cSince you put it that way\u2014yes. Tommen. You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both.\u201d\n\u201cRemind me never to play these guessing games with you again. You cheat. \u201c\n\u201cPrince Tommen is a good boy.\u201d\n\u201cIf I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he\u2019s still young, he may even grow to be a good man.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a good king?\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey is king.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tommen is heir, should anything ill befall His Grace. Tommen, whose nature is so sweet, and notably\u2026 tractable.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a suspicious mind, Varys.\u201d\n\u201cI shall take that as a tribute, my lord. In any case, Prince Doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do him. Very deftly done, I would say\u2026 but for one small flaw.\u201d\nThe dwarf laughed. \u201cNamed Cersei?\u201d\n\u201cWhat avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb? Perhaps, for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm, the queen might be persuaded to send away Tommen or Myrcella. But both of them? Surely not.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Cersei does not know will never hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy.\u201d And when Varys giggled, he thought, Three.",

      "content": "Sansa\nCome to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home.\nThe words were the same on the hundredth reading as they\u2019d been on the first, when Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow. She did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it. The note was unsigned, unsealed, and the hand unfamiliar. She crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself. \u201cCome to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home,\u201d she breathed, ever so faintly.\nWhat could it mean? Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good? Nervously, she rubbed her stomach. The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given her had faded to an ugly yellow, but still hurt. His fist had been mailed when he hit her. It was her own fault. She must learn to hide her feelings better, so as not to anger Joffrey. When she heard that the Imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall, she had forgotten herself and said, \u201cI hope the Others get him.\u201d The king had not been pleased.\nCome to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home.\nSansa had prayed so hard. Could this be her answer at last, a true knight sent to save her? Perhaps it was one of the Redwyne twins, or bold Ser Balon Swann\u2026 or even Beric Dondarrion, the young lord her friend Jeyne Poole had loved, with his red-gold hair and the spray of stars on his black cloak.\nCome to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home.\nWhat if it was some cruel jape of Joffrey\u2019s, like the day he had taken her up to the battlements to show her Father\u2019s head? Or perhaps it was some subtle snare to prove she was not loyal. If she went to the godswood, would she find Ser Ilyn Payne waiting for her, sitting silent under the heart tree with Ice in his hand, his pale eyes watching to see if she\u2019d come?\nCome to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home.\nWhen the door opened, she hurriedly stuffed the note under her sheet and sat on it. It was her bedmaid, the mousy one with the limp brown hair. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Sansa demanded.\n\u201cWill milady be wanting a bath tonight?\u201d\n\u201cA fire, I think\u2026 I feel a chill.\u201d She was shivering, though the day had been hot.\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d\nSansa watched the girl suspiciously. Had she seen the note? Had she put it under the pillow? It did not seem likely; she seemed a stupid girl, not one you\u2019d want delivering secret notes, but Sansa did not know her. The queen had her servants changed every fortnight, to make certain none of them befriended her.\nWhen a fire was blazing in the hearth, Sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered her out. The girl was quick to obey, as ever, but Sansa decided there was something sly about her eyes. Doubtless, she was scurrying off to report to the queen, or maybe Varys. All her maids spied on her, she was certain.\nOnce alone, she thrust the note in the flames, watching the parchment curl and blacken. Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home. She drifted to her window. Below, she could see a short knight in moon-pale armor and a heavy white cloak pacing the drawbridge. From his height, it could only be Ser Preston Greenfield. The queen had given her freedom of the castle, but even so, he would want to know where she was going if she tried to leave Maegor\u2019s Holdfast at this time of night. What was she to tell him? Suddenly she was glad she had burned the note.\nShe unlaced her gown and crawled into her bed, but she did not sleep. Was he still there? she wondered. How long will he wait? It was so cruel, to send her a note and tell her nothing. The thoughts went round and round in her head.\nIf only she had someone to tell her what to do. She missed Septa Mordane, and even more Jeyne Poole, her truest friend. The septa had lost her head with the rest, for the crime of serving House Stark. Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne, who had disappeared from her rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again. She tried not to think of them too often, yet sometimes the memories came unbidden, and then it was hard to hold back the tears. Once in a while, Sansa even missed her sister. By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the winter town if she liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and it got boring going round in a circle all day.\nShe was wide awake when she heard the shouting. Distant at first, then growing louder. Many voices yelling together. She could not make out the words. And there were horses as well, and pounding feet, shouts of command. She crept to her window and saw men running on the walls, carrying spears and torches. Go back to your bed, Sansa told herself, this is nothing that concerns you, just some new trouble out in the city. The talk at the wells had all been of troubles in the city of late. People were crowding in, running from the war, and many had no way to live save by robbing and killing each other. Go to bed.\nBut when she looked, the white knight was gone, the bridge across the dry moat down but undefended.\nSansa turned away without thinking and ran to her wardrobe. Oh, what am I doing? she asked herself as she dressed. This is madness. She could see the lights of many torches on the curtain walls. Had Stannis and Renly come at last to kill Joffrey and claim their brother\u2019s throne? If so, the guards would raise the drawbridge, cutting off Maegor\u2019s Holdfast from the outer castle. Sansa threw a plain grey cloak over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat. If it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more, she told herself. She hid the blade under her cloak.\nA column of red-cloaked swordsmen ran past as she slipped out into the night. She waited until they were well past before she darted across the undefended drawbridge. In the yard, men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of their horses. She glimpsed Ser Preston near the stables with three others of the Kingsguard, white cloaks bright as the moon as they helped Joffrey into his armor. Her breath caught in her throat when she saw the king. Thankfully, he did not see her. He was shouting for his sword and crossbow.\nThe noise receded as she moved deeper into the castle, never daring to look back for fear that Joffrey might be watching\u2026 or worse, following. The serpentine steps twisted ahead, striped by bars of flickering light from the narrow windows above. Sansa was panting by the time she reached the top. She ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a wall to catch her breath. When something brushed against her leg, she almost jumped out of her skin, but it was only a cat, a ragged black tom with a chewed-off ear. The creature spit at her and leapt away.\nBy the time she reached the godswood, the noises had faded to a faint rattle of steel and a distant shouting. Sansa pulled her cloak tighter. The air was rich with the smells of earth and leaf. Lady would have liked this place, she thought. There was something wild about a godswood; even here, in the heart of the castle at the heart of the city, you could feel the old gods watching with a thousand unseen eyes.\nSansa had favored her mother\u2019s gods over her father\u2019s. She loved the statues, the pictures in leaded glass, the fragrance of burning incense, the septons with their robes and crystals, the magical play of the rainbows over altars inlaid with mother-of-pearl and onyx and lapis lazuli. Yet she could not deny that the godswood had a certain power too. Especially by night. Help me, she prayed, send me a friend, a true knight to champion me\u2026\nShe moved from tree to tree, feeling the roughness of the bark beneath her fingers. Leaves brushed at her cheeks. Had she come too late? He would not have left so soon, would he? Or had he even been here? Dare she risk calling out? It seemed so hushed and still here\u2026\n\u201cI feared you would not come, child.\u201d\nSansa whirled. A man stepped out of the shadows, heavyset, thick of neck, shambling. He wore a dark grey robe with the cowl pulled forward, but when a thin sliver of moonlight touched his cheek, she knew him at once by the blotchy skin and web of broken veins beneath. \u201cSer Dontos,\u201d she breathed, heartbroken. \u201cWas it you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d When he moved closer, she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath. \u201cMe.\u201d He reached out a hand.\nSansa shrank back. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d She slid her hand under her cloak, to her hidden knife. \u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want with me?\u201d\n\u201cOnly to help you,\u201d Dontos said, \u201cas you helped me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one cup of wine, to help my courage. If they catch me now, they\u2019ll strip the skin off my back.\u201d\nAnd what will they do to me? Sansa found herself thinking of Lady again. She could smell out falsehood, she could, but she was dead, Father had killed her, on account of Arya. She drew the knife and held it before her with both hands.\n\u201cAre you going to stab me?\u201d Dontos asked.\n\u201cI will,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me who sent you.\u201d\n\u201cNo one, sweet lady. I swear it on my honor as a knight.\u201d\n\u201cA knight?\u201d Joffrey had decreed that he was to be a knight no longer, only a fool, lower even than Moon Boy. \u201cI prayed to the gods for a knight to come save me,\u201d she said. \u201cI prayed and prayed. Why would they send me a drunken old fool?\u201d\n\u201cI deserve that, though\u2026 I know it\u2019s queer, but\u2026 all those years I was a knight, I was truly a fool, and now that I am a fool I think\u2026 I think I may find it in me to be a knight again, sweet lady. And all because of you\u2026 your grace, your courage. You saved me, not only from Joffrey, but from myself.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cThe singers say there was another fool once who was the greatest knight of all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFlorian,\u201d Sansa whispered. A shiver went through her.\n\u201cSweet lady, I would be your Florian,\u201d Dontos said humbly, falling to his knees before her.\nSlowly, Sansa lowered the knife. Her head seemed terribly light, as if she were floating. This is madness, to trust myself to this drunkard, but if I turn away will the chance ever come again? \u201cHow\u2026 how would you do it? Get me away?\u201d\nSer Dontos raised his face to her. \u201cTaking you from the castle, that will be the hardest. Once you\u2019re out, there are ships that would take you home. I\u2019d need to find the coin and make the arrangements, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cCould we go now?\u201d she asked, hardly daring to hope.\n\u201cThis very night? No, my lady, I fear not. First I must find a sure way to get you from the castle when the hour is ripe. It will not be easy, nor quick. They watch me as well.\u201d He licked his lips nervously. \u201cWill you put away your blade?\u201d\nSansa slipped the knife beneath her cloak. \u201cRise, ser.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, sweet lady.\u201d Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and leaves from his knees. \u201cYour lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing\u2026 and yet, when Joffrey would have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan the Bold. I\u2019ve won no tourneys, no renown in war\u2026 but I was a knight once, and you have helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours.\u201d Ser Dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw. \u201cI vow, with your father\u2019s gods as witness, that I shall send you home.\u201d\nHe swore. A solemn oath, before the gods. \u201cThen\u2026 I will put myself in your hands, ser. But how will I know, when it is time to go? Will you send me another note?\u201d\nSer Dontos glanced about anxiously. \u201cThe risk is too great. You must come here, to the godswood. As often as you can. This is the safest place. The only safe place. Nowhere else. Not in your chambers nor mine nor on the steps nor in the yard, even if it seems we are alone. The stones have ears in the Red Keep, and only here may we talk freely.\u201d\n\u201cOnly here,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I should seem cruel or mocking or indifferent when men are watching, forgive me, child. I have a role to play, and you must do the same. One misstep and our heads will adorn the walls as did your father\u2019s.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou will need to be brave and strong\u2026 and patient, patient above all.\u201d\n\u201cI will be,\u201d she promised, \u201cbut\u2026 please\u2026 make it as soon as you can. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d Ser Dontos said, smiling wanly. \u201cAnd now you must go, before you are missed.\u201d\n\u201cYou will not come with me?\u201d\n\u201cBetter if we are never seen together.\u201d\nNodding, Sansa took a step\u2026 then spun back, nervous, and softly laid a kiss on his cheek, her eyes closed. \u201cMy Florian,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe gods heard my prayer.\u201d\nShe flew along the river walk, past the small kitchen, and through the pig yard, her hurried footsteps lost beneath the squealing of the hogs in their pens. Home, she thought, home, he is going to take me home, he\u2019ll keep me safe, my Florian. The songs about Florian and Jonquil were her very favorites. Florian was homely too, though not so old.\nShe was racing headlong down the serpentine steps when a man lurched out of a hidden doorway. Sansa caromed into him and lost her balance. Iron fingers caught her by the wrist before she could fall, and a deep voice rasped at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a long roll down the serpentine, little bird. Want to kill us both?\u201d His laughter was rough as a saw on stone. \u201cMaybe you do.\u201d\nThe Hound. \u201cNo, my lord, pardons, I\u2019d never.\u201d Sansa averted her eyes but it was too late, he\u2019d seen her face. \u201cPlease, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d She tried to wriggle free.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s Joff\u2019s little bird doing flying down the serpentine in the black of night?\u201d When she did not answer, he shook her. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d\n\u201cThe g-g-godswood, my lord,\u201d she said, not daring to lie. \u201cPraying\u2026 praying for my father, and\u2026 for the king, praying that he\u2019d not be hurt.\u201d\n\u201cThink I\u2019m so drunk that I\u2019d believe that?\u201d He let go his grip on her arm, swaying slightly as he stood, stripes of light and darkness falling across his terrible burnt face. \u201cYou look almost a woman\u2026 face, teats, and you\u2019re taller too, almost\u2026 ah, you\u2019re still a stupid little bird, aren\u2019t you? Singing all the songs they taught you\u2026 sing me a song, why don\u2019t you? Go on. Sing to me. Some song about knights and fair maids. You like knights, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe was scaring her. \u201cT-true knights, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cTrue knights,\u201d he mocked. \u201cAnd I\u2019m no lord, no more than I\u2019m a knight. Do I need to beat that into you?\u201d Clegane reeled and almost fell. \u201cGods,\u201d he swore, \u201ctoo much wine. Do you like wine, little bird? True wine? A flagon of sour red, dark as blood, all a man needs. Or a woman.\u201d He laughed, shook his head. \u201cDrunk as a dog, damn me. You come now. Back to your cage, little bird. I\u2019ll take you there. Keep you safe for the king.\u201d The Hound gave her a push, oddly gentle, and followed her down the steps. By the time they reached the bottom, he had lapsed back into a brooding silence, as if he had forgotten she was there.\nWhen they reached Maegor\u2019s Holdfast, she was alarmed to see that it was Ser Boros Blount who now held the bridge. His high white helm turned stiffly at the sound of their footsteps. Sansa flinched away from his gaze. Ser Boros was the worst of the Kingsguard, an ugly man with a foul temper, all scowls and jowls.\n\u201cThat one is nothing to fear, girl.\u201d The Hound laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. \u201cPaint stripes on a toad, he does not become a tiger.\u201d\nSer Boros lifted his visor. \u201cSer, where\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck your ser, Boros. You\u2019re the knight, not me. I\u2019m the king\u2019s dog, remember? \u201c\n\u201cThe king was looking for his dog earlier.\u201d\n\u201cThe dog was drinking. It was your night to shield him, ser. You and my other brothers.\u201d\nSer Boros turned to Sansa. \u201cHow is it you are not in your chambers at this hour, lady?\u201d\n\u201cI went to the godswood to pray for the safety of the king.\u201d The lie sounded better this time, almost true.\n\u201cYou expect her to sleep with all the noise?\u201d Clegane said. \u201cWhat was the trouble?\u201d\n\u201cFools at the gate,\u201d Ser Boros admitted. \u201cSome loose tongues spread tales of the preparations for Tyrek\u2019s wedding feast, and these wretches got it in their heads they should be feasted too. His Grace led a sortie and sent them scurrying.\u201d\n\u201cA brave boy,\u201d Clegane said, mouth twitching.\nLet us see how brave he is when he faces my brother, Sansa thought. The Hound escorted her across the drawbridge. As they were winding their way up the steps, she said, \u201cWhy do you let people call you a dog? You won\u2019t let anyone call you a knight.\u201d\n\u201cI like dogs better than knights. My father\u2019s father was kennelmaster at the Rock. One autumn year, Lord Tytos came between a lioness and her prey. The lioness didn\u2019t give a shit that she was Lannister\u2019s own sigil. Bitch tore into my lord\u2019s horse and would have done for my lord too, but my grandfather came up with the hounds. Three of his dogs died running her off. My grandfather lost a leg, so Lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse, and took his son to squire. The three dogs on our banner are the three that died, in the yellow of autumn grass. A hound will die for you, but never lie to you. And he\u2019ll look you straight in the face.\u201d He cupped her under the jaw, raising her chin, his fingers pinching her painfully. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more than little birds can do, isn\u2019t it? I never got my song.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I know a song about Florian and Jonquil.\u201d\n\u201cFlorian and Jonquil? A fool and his cunt. Spare me. But one day I\u2019ll have a song from you, whether you will it or no.\u201d\n\u201cI will sing it for you gladly.\u201d\nSandor Clegane snorted. \u201cPretty thing, and such a bad liar. A dog can smell a lie, you know. Look around you, and take a good whiff. They\u2019re all liars here\u2026 and every one better than you.\u201d",

      "content": "Arya\nWhen she climbed all the way up to the highest branch, Arya could see chimneys poking through the trees. Thatched roofs clustered along the shore of the lake and the small stream that emptied into it, and a wooden pier jutted out into the water beside a low long building with a slate roof.\nShe skinnied farther out, until the branch began to sag under her weight. No boats were tied to the pier, but she could see thin tendrils of smoke rising from some of the chimneys, and part of a wagon jutting out behind a stable.\nSomeone\u2019s there. Arya chewed her lip. All the other places they\u2019d come upon had been empty and desolate. Farms, villages, castles, septs, barns, it made no matter. If it could burn, the Lannisters had burned it; if it could die, they\u2019d killed it. They had even set the woods ablaze where they could, though the leaves were still green and wet from recent rains, and the fires had not spread. \u201cThey would have burned the lake if they could have,\u201d Gendry had said, and Arya knew he was right. On the night of their escape, the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake was afire.\nWhen they finally summoned the nerve to steal back into the ruins the next night, nothing remained but blackened stones, the hollow shells of houses, and corpses. In some places wisps of pale smoke still rose from the ashes. Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back, and Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill them too, but Lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the holdfast. They found the gates broken down, the walls partly demolished, and the inside strewn with the unburied dead. One look was enough for Gendry. \u201cThey\u2019re killed, every one,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd dogs have been at them too, look.\u201d\n\u201cOr wolves.\u201d\n\u201cDogs, wolves, it makes no matter. It\u2019s done here.\u201d\nBut Arya would not leave until they found Yoren. They couldn\u2019t have killed him, she told herself, he was too hard and tough, and a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch besides. She said as much to Gendry as they searched among the corpses.\nThe axe blow that had killed him had split his skull apart, but the great tangled beard could be no one else\u2019s, or the garb, patched and unwashed and so faded it was more grey than black. Ser Amory Lorch had given no more thought to burying his own dead than to those he had murdered, and the corpses of four Lannister men-at-arms were heaped near Yoren\u2019s. Arya wondered how many it had taken to bring him down.\nHe was going to take me home, she thought as they dug the old man\u2019s hole. There were too many dead to bury them all, but Yoren at least must have a grave, Arya had insisted. He was going to bring me safe to Winterfell, he promised. Part of her wanted to cry. The other part wanted to kick him.\nIt was Gendry who thought of the lord\u2019s towerhouse and the three that Yoren had sent to hold it. They had come under attack as well, but the round tower had only one entry, a second-story door reached by a ladder. Once that had been pulled inside, Ser Amory\u2019s men could not get at them. The Lannisters had piled brush around the tower\u2019s base and set it afire, but the stone would not burn, and Lorch did not have the patience to starve them out. Cutjack opened the door at Gendry\u2019s shout, and when Kurz said they\u2019d be better pressing on north than going back, Arya had clung to the hope that she still might reach Winterfell.\nWell, this village was no Winterfell, but those thatched roofs promised warmth and shelter and maybe even food, if they were bold enough to risk them. Unless it\u2019s Lorch there. He had horses; he would have traveled faster than us.\nShe watched from the tree for a long time, hoping she might see something; a man, a horse, a banner, anything that would help her know. A few times she glimpsed motion, but the buildings were so far off it was hard to be certain. Once, very clearly, she heard the whinny of a horse.\nThe air was full of birds, crows mostly. From afar, they were no larger than flies as they wheeled and flapped above the thatched roofs. To the east, Gods Eye was a sheet of sun-hammered blue that filled half the world. Some days, as they made their slow way up the muddy shore (Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the sense in that), Arya felt as though the lake were calling her. She wanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see, not even to wash them. At the end of the day she would often sit on a rock and dangle her feet in the cool water. She had finally thrown away her cracked and rotted shoes. Walking barefoot was hard at first, but the blisters had finally broken, the cuts had healed, and her soles had turned to leather. The mud was nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she walked.\nFrom up here, she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast. Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene\u2026 no one had told them that war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan. The other part wanted to eat one. She had broken her fast on some acorn paste and a handful of bugs. Bugs weren\u2019t so bad when you got used to them. Worms were worse, but still not as bad as the pain in your belly after days without food. Finding bugs was easy, all you had to do was kick over a rock. Arya had eaten a bug once when she was little, just to make Sansa screech, so she hadn\u2019t been afraid to eat another. Weasel wasn\u2019t either, but Hot Pie retched up the beetle he tried to swallow, and Lommy and Gendry wouldn\u2019t even try. Yesterday Gendry had caught a frog and shared it with Lommy, and, a few days before, Hot Pie had found blackberries and stripped the bush bare, but mostly they had been living on water and acorns. Kurz had told them how to use rocks and make a kind of acorn paste. it tasted awful.\nShe wished the poacher hadn\u2019t died. He\u2019d known more about the woods than all the rest of them together, but he\u2019d taken an arrow through the shoulder pulling in the ladder at the towerhouse. Tarber had packed it with mud and moss from the lake, and for a day or two Kurz swore the wound was nothing, even though the flesh of his throat was turning dark while angry red welts crept up his jaw and down his chest. Then one morning he couldn\u2019t find the strength to get up, and by the next he was dead.\nThey buried him under a mound of stones, and Cutjack had claimed his sword and hunting horn, while Tarber helped himself to bow and boots and knife. They\u2019d taken it all when they left. At first they thought the two had just gone hunting, that they\u2019d soon return with game and feed them all. But they waited and waited, until finally Gendry made them move on. Maybe Tarber and Cutjack figured they would stand a better chance without a gaggle of orphan boys to herd along. They probably would too, but that didn\u2019t stop her hating them for leaving.\nBeneath her tree, Hot Pie barked like a dog. Kurz had told them to use animal sounds to signal to each other. An old poacher\u2019s trick, he\u2019d said, but he\u2019d died before he could teach them how to make the sounds right. Hot Pie\u2019s bird calls were awful. His dog was better, but not much.\nArya hopped from the high branch to one beneath it, her hands out for balance. A water dancer never falls. Lightfoot, her toes curled tight around the branch, she walked a few feet, hopped down to a larger limb, then swung hand over hand through the tangle of leaves until she reached the trunk. The bark was rough beneath her fingers, against her toes. She descended quickly, jumping down the final six feet, rolling when she landed.\nGendry gave her a hand to pull her up. \u201cYou were up there a long time. What could you see?\u201d\n\u201cA fishing village, just a little place, north along the shore. Twenty-six thatch roofs and one slate, I counted. I saw part of a wagon. Someone\u2019s there.\u201d\nAt the sound of her voice, Weasel came creeping out from the bushes. Lommy had named her that. He said she looked like a weasel, which wasn\u2019t true, but they couldn\u2019t keep on calling her the crying girl after she finally stopped crying. Her mouth was filthy. Arya hoped she hadn\u2019t been eating mud again.\n\u201cDid you see people?\u201d asked Gendry.\n\u201cMostly just roofs,\u201d Arya admitted, \u201cbut some chimneys were smoking, and I heard a horse.\u201d The Weasel put her arms around her leg, clutching tight. Sometimes she did that now.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s people, there\u2019s food,\u201d Hot Pie said, too loudly. Gendry was always telling him to be more quiet, but it never did any good. \u201cMight be they\u2019d give us some.\u201d\n\u201cMight be they\u2019d kill us too,\u201d Gendry said.\n\u201cNot if we yielded,\u201d Hot Pie said hopefully.\n\u201cNow you sound like Lommy.\u201d\nLommy Greenhands sat propped up between two thick roots at the foot of an oak. A spear had taken him through his left calf during the fight at the holdfast. By the end of the next day, he had to limp along one-legged with an arm around Gendry, and now he couldn\u2019t even do that. They\u2019d hacked branches off trees to make a litter for him, but it was slow, hard work carrying him along, and he whimpered every time they jounced him.\n\u201cWe have to yield,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Yoren should have done. He should have opened the gates like they said.\u201d\nArya was sick of Lommy going on about how Yoren should have yielded. It was all he talked about when they carried him, that and his leg and his empty belly.\nHot Pie agreed. \u201cThey told Yoren to open the gates, they told him in the king\u2019s name. You have to do what they tell you in the king\u2019s name. It was that stinky old man\u2019s fault. If he\u2019d of yielded, they would have left us be.\u201d\nGendry frowned. \u201cKnights and lordlings, they take each other captive and pay ransoms, but they don\u2019t care if the likes of you yield or not.\u201d He turned to Arya. \u201cWhat else did you see?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fishing village, they\u2019d sell us fish, I bet,\u201d said Hot Pie. The lake teemed with fresh fish, but they had nothing to catch them with. Arya had tried to use her hands, the way she\u2019d seen Koss do, but fish were quicker than pigeons and the water played tricks on her eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about fish.\u201d Arya tugged at the Weasel\u2019s matted hair, thinking it might be best to hack it off. \u201cThere\u2019s crows down by the water. Something\u2019s dead there.\u201d\n\u201cFish, washed up on shore,\u201d Hot Pie said. \u201cIf the crows eat it, I bet we could.\u201d\n\u201cWe should catch some crows, we could eat them,\u201d said Lommy. \u201cWe could make a fire and roast them like chickens.\u201d\nGendry looked fierce when he scowled. His beard had grown in thick and black as briar. \u201cI said, no fires.\u201d\n\u201cLommy\u2019s hungry,\u201d Hot Pie whined, \u201cand I am too.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hungry,\u201d said Arya.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Lommy spat from the ground. \u201cWorm breath.\u201d\nArya could have kicked him in his wound. \u201cI said I\u2019d dig worms for you too, if you wanted.\u201d\nLommy made a disgusted face. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my leg, I\u2019d hunt us some boars.\u201d\n\u201cSome boars,\u201d she mocked. \u201cYou need a boarspear to hunt boars, and horses and dogs, and men to flush the boar from its lair.\u201d Her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with Robb and Jon. Once he even took Bran, but never Arya, even though she was older. Septa Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies, and Mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own hawk. She was older now, but if she had a hawk she\u2019d eat it.\n\u201cWhat do you know about hunting boars?\u201d said Hot Pie.\n\u201cMore than you.\u201d\nGendry was in no mood to hear it. \u201cQuiet, both of you, I need to think what to do.\u201d He always looked pained when he tried to think, like it hurt him something fierce.\n\u201cYield,\u201d Lommy said.\n\u201cI told you to shut up about the yielding. We don\u2019t even know who\u2019s in there. Maybe we can steal some food.\u201d\n\u201cLommy could steal, if it wasn\u2019t for his leg,\u201d said Hot Pie. \u201cHe was a thief in the city.\u201d\n\u201cA bad thief,\u201d Arya said, \u201cor he wouldn\u2019t have got caught.\u201d\nGendry squinted up at the sun. \u201cEvenfall will be the best time to sneak in. I\u2019ll go scout come dark.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go,\u201d Arya said. \u201cYou\u2019re too noisy.\u201d\nGendry got that look on his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll both go.\u201d\n\u201cArry should go,\u201d said Lommy. \u201cHe\u2019s sneakier than you are.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll both go, I said.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if you don\u2019t come back? Hot Pie can\u2019t carry me by himself, you know he can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s wolves,\u201d Hot Pie said. \u201cI heard them last night, when I had the watch. They sounded close.\u201d\nArya had heard them too. She\u2019d been asleep in the branches of an elm, but the howling had woken her. She\u2019d sat awake for a good hour, listening to them, prickles creeping up her spine.\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t even let us have a fire to keep them off,\u201d Hot Pie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, leaving us for the wolves.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is leaving you,\u201d Gendry said in disgust. \u201cLommy has his spear if the wolves come, and you\u2019ll be with him. We\u2019re just going to go see, that\u2019s all; we\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever it is, you should yield to them,\u201d Lommy whined. \u201cI need some potion for my leg, it hurts bad.\u201d\n\u201cIf we see any leg potion, we\u2019ll bring it,\u201d Gendry said. \u201cArry, let\u2019s go, I want to get near before the sun is down. Hot Pie, you keep Weasel here, I don\u2019t want her following.\u201d\n\u201cLast time she kicked me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll kick you if you don\u2019t keep her here.\u201d Without waiting for an answer, Gendry donned his steel helm and walked off.\nArya had to scamper to keep up. Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she was, and long of leg as well. For a while he said nothing, just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on his face, making too much noise. But finally he stopped and said, \u201cI think Lommy\u2019s going to die.\u201d\nShe was not surprised. Kurz had died of his wound, and he\u2019d been a lot stronger than Lommy. Whenever it was Arya\u2019s turn to help carry him, she could feel how warm his skin was, and smell the stink off his leg. \u201cMaybe we could find a maester\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou only find maesters in castles, and even if we found one, he wouldn\u2019t dirty his hands on the likes of Lommy.\u201d Gendry ducked under a low-hanging limb.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to him, she was certain.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he\u2019d leave us.\u201d They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. \u201cI\u2019m sick of carrying him, and I\u2019m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I\u2019d knock his teeth in. Lommy\u2019s no use to anyone. That crying girl\u2019s no use either.\u201d\n\u201cYou leave Weasel alone, she\u2019s just scared and hungry is all.\u201d Arya glanced back, but the girl was not following for once. Hot Pie must have grabbed her, like Gendry had told him.\n\u201cShe\u2019s no use,\u201d Gendry repeated stubbornly. \u201cHer and Hot Pie and Lommy, they\u2019re slowing us down, and they\u2019re going to get us killed. You\u2019re the only one of the bunch who\u2019s good for anything. Even if you are a girl.\u201d\nArya froze in her steps. \u201cI\u2019m not a girl!\u201d\n\u201cYes you are. Do you think I\u2019m as stupid as they are?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re stupider. The Night\u2019s Watch doesn\u2019t take girls, everyone knows that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know why Yoren brought you, but he must have had some reason. You\u2019re still a girl.\u201d\n\u201cI am not!\u201d\n\u201cThen pull out your cock and take a piss. Go on.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to take a piss. If I wanted to I could.\u201d\n\u201cLiar. You can\u2019t take out your cock because you don\u2019t have one. I never noticed before when there were thirty of us, but you always go off in the woods to make your water. You don\u2019t see Hot Pie doing that, nor me neither. If you\u2019re not a girl, you must be some eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not.\u201d Gendry smiled. \u201cYou want me to take out my cock and prove it? I don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d\n\u201cYes you do,\u201d Arya blurted, desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didn\u2019t have. \u201cThose gold cloaks were after you at the inn, and you won\u2019t tell us why.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I knew. I think Yoren knew, but he never told me. Why did you think they were after you, though?\u201d\nArya bit her lip. She remembered what Yoren had said, the day he had hacked off her hair. This lot, half o\u2019 them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half\u2019d do the same, only they\u2019d rape you first. Only Gendry was different, the queen wanted him too. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you\u2019ll tell me,\u201d she said warily.\n\u201cI would if I knew, Arry\u2026 is that really what you\u2019re called, or do you have some girl\u2019s name?\u201d\nArya glared at the gnarled root by her feet. She realized that the pretense was done. Gendry knew, and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise. She could draw Needle and kill him where he stood, or else trust him. She wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d be able to kill him, even if she tried; he had his own sword, and he was a lot stronger. All that was left was the truth. \u201cLommy and Hot Pie can\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d he swore. \u201cNot from me.\u201d\n\u201cArya.\u201d She raised her eyes to his. \u201cMy name is Arya. Of House Stark.\u201d\n\u201cOf House\u2026\u201d It took him a moment before he said, \u201cThe King\u2019s Hand was named Stark. The one they killed for a traitor.\u201d\n\u201cHe was never a traitor. He was my father.\u201d\nGendry\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you thought\u2026\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cYoren was taking me home to Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 you\u2019re highborn then, a\u2026 you\u2019ll be a lady\u2026\u201d\nArya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt under her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands. Septa Mordane wouldn\u2019t even know me, I bet. Sansa might, but she\u2019d pretend not to. \u201cMy mother\u2019s a lady, and my sister, but I never was.\u201d\n\u201cYes you were. You were a lord\u2019s daughter and you lived in a castle, didn\u2019t you? And you\u2026 gods be good, I never\u2026\u201d All of a sudden Gendry seemed uncertain, almost afraid. \u201cAll that about cocks, I never should have said that. And I been pissing in front of you and everything, I\u2026 I beg your pardon, m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cStop that!\u201d Arya hissed. Was he mocking her?\n\u201cI know my courtesies, m\u2019lady,\u201d Gendry said, stubborn as ever. \u201cWhenever highborn girls came into the shop with their fathers, my master told me I was to bend the knee, and speak only when they spoke to me, and call them m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cIf you start calling me m\u2019lady, even Hot Pie is going to notice. And you better keep on pissing the same way too.\u201d\n\u201cAs m\u2019lady commands.\u201d\nArya slammed his chest with both hands. He tripped over a stone and sat down with a thump. \u201cWhat kind of lord\u2019s daughter are you?\u201d he said, laughing.\n\u201cThis kind.\u201d She kicked him in the side, but it only made him laugh harder. \u201cYou laugh all you like. I\u2019m going to see who\u2019s in the village.\u201d The sun had already fallen below the trees; dusk would be on them in no time at all. For once it was Gendry who had to hurry after. \u201cYou smell that?\u201d she asked.\nHe sniffed the air. \u201cRotten fish?\u201d\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cWe better be careful. I\u2019ll go around west, see if there\u2019s some road. There must be if you saw a wagon. You take the shore. If you need help, bark like a dog.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid. If I need help, I\u2019ll shout help.\u201d She darted away, bare feet silent in the grass. When she glanced back over her shoulder, he was watching her with that pained look on his face that meant he was thinking. He\u2019s probably thinking that he shouldn\u2019t be letting m\u2019lady go stealing food. Arya just knew he was going to be stupid now.\nThe smell grew stronger as she got closer to the village. It did not smell like rotten fish to her. This stench was ranker, fouler. She wrinkled her nose.\nWhere the trees began to thin, she used the undergrowth, slipping from bush to bush quiet as a shadow. Every few yards she stopped to listen. The third time, she heard horses, and a man\u2019s voice as well. And the smell got worse. Dead man\u2019s stink, that\u2019s what it is. She had smelled it before, with Yoren and the others.\nA dense thicket of brambles grew south of the village. By the time she reached it, the long shadows of sunset had begun to fade, and the lantern bugs were coming out. She could see thatched roofs just beyond the hedge. She crept along until she found a gap and squirmed through on her belly, keeping well hidden until she saw what made the smell.\nBeside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye, a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up, and things that had once been men dangled there, their feet in chains, while crows pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse. For every crow there were a hundred flies. When the wind blew off the lake, the nearest corpse twisted on its chain, ever so slightly. The crows had eaten most of its face, and something else had been at it as well, something much larger. Throat and chest had been torn apart, and glistening green entrails and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened. one arm had been ripped right off the shoulder; Arya saw the bones a few feet away, gnawed and cracked, picked clean of meat.\nShe made herself look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond him, telling herself she was hard as a stone. Corpses all, so savaged and decayed that it took her a moment to realize they had been stripped before they were hanged. They did not look like naked people; they hardly looked like people at all. The crows had eaten their eyes, and sometimes their faces. Of the sixth in the long row, nothing remained but a single leg, still tangled in its chains, swaying with each breeze.\nFear cuts deeper than swords. Dead men could not hurt her, but whoever had killed them could. Well beyond the gibbet, two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in front of the long low building by the water, the one with the slate roof. A pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of it, banners drooping from each staff. One looked red and one paler, white or yellow maybe, but both were limp and with the dusk settling, she could not even be certain that red one was Lannister crimson. I don\u2019t need to see the lion, I can see all the dead people, who else would it be but Lannisters?\nThen there was a shout.\nThe two spearmen turned at the cry, and a third man came into view, shoving a captive before him. It was growing too dark to make out faces, but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm, and when Arya saw the horns she knew it was Gendry. You stupid stupid stupid STUPID! she thought. If he\u2019d been here she would have kicked him again.\nThe guards were talking loudly, but she was too far away to make out the words, especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand. One of the spearmen snatched the helm off Gendry\u2019s head and asked him a question, but he must not have liked the answer, because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down. The one who\u2019d captured him gave him a kick, while the second spearman was trying on the bull\u2019s-head helm. Finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the storehouse. When they opened the heavy wooden doors, a small boy darted out, but one of the guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside. Arya heard sobbing from inside the building, and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip.\nThe guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them. Just then, a breath of wind came sighing off the lake, and the banners stirred and lifted. The one on the tall staff bore the golden lion, as she\u2019d feared. On the other, three sleek black shapes ran across a field as yellow as butter. Dogs, she thought. Arya had seen those dogs before, but where?\nIt didn\u2019t matter. The only thing that mattered was that they had Gendry. Even if he was stubborn and stupid, she had to get him out. She wondered if they knew that the queen wanted him.\nOne of the guards took off his helm and donned Gendry\u2019s instead. It made her angry to see him wearing it, but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him. She thought she heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse, muffled by the masonry, but it was hard to be certain.\nShe stayed long enough to see the guard changed, and much more besides. Men came and went. They led their horses down to the stream to drink. A hunting party returned from the wood, carrying a deer\u2019s carcass slung from a pole. She watched them clean and gut it and build a cookfire on the far side of the stream, and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly with the stench of corruption. Her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch. The prospect of food brought other men out of the houses, near all of them wearing bits of mail or boiled leather. When the deer was cooked, the choicest portions were carried to one of the houses.\nShe thought that the dark might let her crawl close and free Gendry, but the guards kindled torches off the cookfire. A squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the storehouse, and later two more men joined them and they all passed a skin of wine from hand to hand. When it was empty the others left, but the two guards remained, leaning on their spears.\nArya\u2019s arms and legs were stiff when she finally wriggled out from under the briar into the dark of the wood. It was a black night, with a thin sliver of moon appearing and disappearing as the clouds blew past. Silent as a shadow, she told herself as she moved through the trees. In this darkness she dared not run, for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing her way. On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against its shores. on her right a wind sighed through the branches, and leaves rustled and stirred. Far off, she heard the howling of wolves.\nLommy and Hot Pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind them. \u201cQuiet,\u201d she told them, putting an arm around Weasel when the little girl came running up.\nHot Pie stared at her with big eyes. \u201cWe thought you left us.\u201d He had his shortsword in hand, the one Yoren had taken off the gold cloak. \u201cI was scared you was a wolf.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Bull?\u201d asked Lommy.\n\u201cThey caught him,\u201d Arya whispered. \u201cWe have to get him out. Hot Pie, you got to help. We\u2019ll sneak up and kill the guards, and then I\u2019ll open the door.\u201d\nHot Pie and Lommy exchanged a look. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t count,\u201d Arya admitted. \u201cTwenty at least, but only two on the door.\u201d\nHot Pie looked as if he were going to cry. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight twenty.\u201d\n\u201cYou only need to fight one. I\u2019ll do the other and we\u2019ll get Gendry out and run.\u201d\n\u201cWe should yield,\u201d Lommy said. \u201cJust go in and yield.\u201d\nArya shook her head stubbornly.\n\u201cThen just leave him, Arry,\u201d Lommy pleaded. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about the rest of us. If we hide, they\u2019ll go away, you know they will. It\u2019s not our fault Gendry\u2019s captured.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupid, Lommy,\u201d Arya said angrily. \u201cYou\u2019ll die if we don\u2019t get Gendry out. Who\u2019s going to carry you?\u201d\n\u201cYou and Hot Pie.\u201d\n\u201cAll the time, with no one else to help? We\u2019ll never do it. Gendry was the strong one. Anyhow, I don\u2019t care what you say, I\u2019m going back for him.\u201d She looked at Hot Pie. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d\nHot Pie glanced at Lommy, at Arya, at Lommy again. \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said reluctantly.\n\u201cLommy, you keep Weasel here.\u201d\nHe grabbed the little girl by the hand and pulled her close. \u201cWhat if the wolves come?\u201d\n\u201cYield,\u201d Arya suggested.\nFinding their way back to the village seemed to take hours. Hot Pie kept stumbling in the dark and losing his way, and Arya had to wait for him and double back. Finally she took him by the hand and led him along through the trees. \u201cJust be quiet and follow.\u201d When they could make out the first faint glow of the village fires against the sky, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s dead men hanging on the other side of the hedge, but they\u2019re nothing to be scared of, just remember fear cuts deeper than swords. We have to go real quiet and slow.\u201d Hot Pie nodded.\nShe wriggled under the briar first and waited for him on the far side, crouched low. Hot Pie emerged pale and panting, face and arms bloody with long scratches. He started to say something, but Arya put a finger to his lips. On hands and knees, they crawled along the gibbet, beneath the swaying dead. Hot Pie never once looked up, nor made a sound.\nUntil the crow landed on his back, and he gave a muffled gasp. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d a voice boomed suddenly from the dark.\nHot Pie leapt to his feet. \u201cI yield!\u201d He threw away his sword as dozens of crows rose shrieking and complaining to flap about the corpses. Arya grabbed his leg and tried to drag him back down, but he wrenched loose and ran forward, waving his arms. \u201cI yield, I yield.\u201d\nShe bounced up and drew Needle, but by then men were all around her. Arya slashed at the nearest, but he blocked her with a steel-clad arm, and someone else slammed into her and dragged her to the ground, and a third man wrenched the sword from her grasp. When she tried to bite, her teeth snapped shut on cold dirty chainmail. \u201cOho, a fierce one,\u201d the man said, laughing. The blow from his iron-clad fist near knocked her head off.\nThey talked over her as she lay hurting, but Arya could not seem to understand the words. Her ears rang. When she tried to crawl off, the earth moved beneath her. They took Needle. The shame of that hurt worse than the pain, and the pain hurt a lot. Jon had given her that sword. Syrio had taught her to use it.\nFinally someone grabbed the front of her jerkin, yanked her to her knees. Hot Pie was kneeling too, before the tallest man Arya had ever seen, a monster from one of Old Nan\u2019s stories. She never saw where the giant had come from. Three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat, and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone. Suddenly Arya knew where she had seen those dogs before. The night of the tourney at King\u2019s Landing, all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions. \u201cThat one belongs to the Hound\u2019s brother,\u201d Sansa had confided when they passed the black dogs on the yellow field. \u201cHe\u2019s even bigger than Hodor, you\u2019ll see. They call him the Mountain That Rides.\u201d\nArya let her head droop, only half aware of what was going on around her. Hot Pie was yielding some more. The Mountain said, \u201cYou\u2019ll lead us to these others,\u201d and walked off. Next she was stumbling past the dead men on their gibbet, while Hot Pie told their captors he\u2019d bake them pies and tarts if they didn\u2019t hurt him. Four men went with them. One carried a torch, one a longsword; two had spears.\nThey found Lommy where they\u2019d left him, under the oak. \u201cI yield,\u201d he called out at once when he saw them. He\u2019d flung away his own spear and raised his hands, splotchy green with old dye. \u201cI yield. Please.\u201d\nThe man with the torch searched around under the trees. \u201cAre you the last? Baker boy said there was a girl.\u201d\n\u201cShe ran off when she heard you coming,\u201d Lommy said. \u201cYou made a lot of noise.\u201d And Arya thought, Run, Weasel, run as far as you can, run and hide and never come back.\n\u201cTell us where we can find that whoreson Dondarrion, and there\u2019ll be a hot meal in it for you.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Lommy blankly.\n\u201cI told you, this lot don\u2019t know no more than those cunts in the village. Waste o\u2019bloody time.\u201d\nOne of the spearmen drifted over to Lommy. \u201cSomething wrong with your leg, boy?\u201d\n\u201cIt got hurt.\u201d\n\u201cCan you walk?\u201d He sounded concerned.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lommy. \u201cYou got to carry me.\u201d\n\u201cThink so?\u201d The man lifted his spear casually and drove the point through the boy\u2019s soft throat. Lommy never even had time to yield again. He jerked once, and that was all. When the man pulled his spear loose, blood sprayed out in a dark fountain. \u201cCarry him, he says,\u201d he muttered, chuckling.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThey had warned him to dress warmly. Tyrion Lannister took them at their word. He was garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet, and over it all he had thrown the shadowskin cloak he had acquired in the Mountains of the Moon. The cloak was absurdly long, made for a man twice his height. When he was not ahorse, the only way to wear the thing was to wrap it around him several times, which made him look like a ball of striped fur.\nEven so, he was glad he had listened. The chill in the long dank vault went bone deep. Timett had chosen to retreat back up to the cellar after a brief taste of the cold below. They were somewhere under the hill of Rhaenys, behind the Guildhall of the Alchemists. The damp stone walls were splotchy with nitre, and the only light came from the sealed iron-and-glass oil lamp that Hallyne the Pyromancer carried so gingerly.\nGingerly indeed\u2026 and these would be the ginger jars. Tyrion lifted one for inspection. It was round and ruddy, a fat clay grapefruit. A little big for his hand, but it would fit comfortably in the grip of a normal man, he knew. The pottery was thin, so fragile that even he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly, lest he crush it in his fist. The clay felt roughened, pebbled. Hallyne told him that was intentional. \u201cA smooth pot is more apt to slip from a man\u2019s grasp.\u201d\nThe wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when Tyrion tilted it to peer inside. The color would be a murky green, he knew, but the poor light made that impossible to confirm. \u201cThick,\u201d he observed.\n\u201cThat is from the cold, my lord,\u201d said Hallyne, a pallid man with soft damp hands and an obsequious manner. He was dressed in striped black-and-scarlet robes trimmed with sable, but the fur looked more than a little patchy and moth-eaten. \u201cAs it warms, the substance will flow more easily, like lamp oil.\u201d\nThe substance was the pyromancers\u2019 own term for wildfire. They called each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been a powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere. Now only a few of the older order remained, and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals\u2026\n\u2026but they could make wildfire. \u201cWater will not quench it, I am told.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so. Once it takes fire, the substance will burn fiercely until it is no more. More, it will seep into cloth, wood, leather, even steel, so they take fire as well.\u201d\nTyrion remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword. Even a thin coating of wildfire could burn for an hour. Thoros always needed a new sword after a melee, but Robert had been fond of the man and ever glad to provide one. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it seep into the clay as well?\u201d\n\u201cOh, but it does,\u201d said Hallyne. \u201cThere is a vault below this one where we store the older pots. Those from King Aerys\u2019s day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits. Very perilous fruits indeed, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, riper now than ever, if you take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, but even so\u2026 by rights they ought to have been destroyed, but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King\u2019s Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task. And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost. Only last year, two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how they came there, but I\u2019m sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror. I myself saw that they were safely moved. I had a cart filled with sand, and sent our most able acolytes. We worked only by night, we\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014did a splendid job, I have no doubt.\u201d Tyrion placed the jar he\u2019d been holding back among its fellows. They covered the table, standing in orderly rows of four and marching away into the subterranean dimness. And there were other tables beyond, many other tables. \u201cThese, ah, fruits of the late King Aerys, can they still be used?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, most certainly\u2026 but carefully, my lord, ever so carefully. As it ages, the substance grows ever more, hmmmm, fickle, let us say. Any flame will set it afire. Any spark. Too much heat and jars will blaze up of their own accord. It is not wise to let them sit in sunlight, even for a short time. Once the fire begins within, the heat causes the substance to expand violently, and the jars shortly fly to pieces. If other jars should happen to be stored in the same vicinity, those go up as well, and so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow many jars do you have at present?\u201d\n\u201cThis morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty. That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys\u2019s day, to be sure.\u201d\n\u201cOur overripe fruits?\u201d\nHallyne bobbed his head. \u201cWisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars, as was promised the queen. I concur.\u201d The pyromancer looked indecently pleased with that prospect.\nAssuming our enemies give you the time. The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret, but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy, dangerous, and time-consuming process. He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast, like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two. If they can truly give us ten thousand\u2026\nHe did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified. Perhaps a smidge of both. \u201cI trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste, Wisdom. We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire, nor even one\u2026 and we most certainly do not want any mishaps.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be no mishaps, my lord Hand. The substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells, and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant it is ready. Above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand. A protective spell has been laid on the floors, hmmm, most powerful. Any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away, and the sand smothers the blaze at once.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention the careless acolyte.\u201d By spell Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant clever trick. He thought he would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it worked, but this was not the time. Perhaps when the war was won.\n\u201cMy brethren are never careless,\u201d Hallyne insisted. \u201cIf I may be, hmmmm, frank\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, do.\u201d\n\u201cThe substance flows through my veins, and lives in the heart of every pyromancer. We respect its power. But the common soldier, hmmmm, the crew of one of the queen\u2019s spitfires, say, in the unthinking frenzy of battle\u2026 any little mistake can bring catastrophe. That cannot be said too often. My father often told King Aerys as much, as his father told old King Jaehaerys.\u201d\n\u201cThey must have listened,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cIf they had burned the city down, someone would have told me. So your counsel is that we had best be careful? \u201c\n\u201cBe very careful,\u201d said Hallyne. \u201cBe very very careful.\u201d\n\u201cThese clay jars\u2026 do you have an ample supply?\u201d\n\u201cWe do, my lord, and thank you for asking.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t mind if I take some, then. A few thousand.\u201d\n\u201cA few thousand?\u201d\n\u201cOr however many your guild can spare, without interfering with production. It\u2019s empty pots I\u2019m asking for, understand. Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates.\u201d\n\u201cI will, my lord, but why\u2026?\u201d\nTyrion smiled up at him. \u201cWhen you tell me to dress warmly, I dress warmly. When you tell me to be careful, well\u2026\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough. Perhaps you would be so good as to escort me back up to my litter?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my great, hmmm, pleasure, my lord.\u201d Hallyne lifted the lamp and led the way back to the stairs. \u201cIt was good of you to visit us. A great honor, hmmm. It has been too long since the King\u2019s Hand graced us with his presence. Not since Lord Rossart, and he was of our order. That was back in King Aerys\u2019s day. King Aerys took a great interest in our work.\u201d\nKing Aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies. His brother Jaime had told him a few stories of the Mad King and his pet pyromancers. \u201cJoffrey will be interested as well, I have no doubt.\u201d Which is why I\u2019d best keep him well away from you.\n\u201cIt is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in his own royal person. I have spoken of it to your royal sister. A great feast\u2026\u201d\nIt was growing warmer as they climbed. \u201cHis Grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war is won.\u201d At my insistence. \u201cThe king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people go without bread.\u201d\n\u201cA most, hmmm, loving gesture, my lord. Perhaps instead some few of us might call upon the king at the Red Keep. A small demonstration of our powers, as it were, to distract His Grace from his many cares for an evening. Wildfire is but one of the dread secrets of our ancient order. Many and wondrous are the things we might show you.\u201d\n\u201cI will take it up with my sister.\u201d Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks, but Joff\u2019s fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough; he had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning them alive.\nWhen at last they reached the top of the steps, Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm. The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone, but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the Iron Torches, a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall. Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance. Tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadn\u2019t known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit, and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him. Wildfire was too costly to squander.\nThey emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the Street of the Sisters, near the foot of Visenya\u2019s Hill. He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men. Given his purpose today, it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard. Besides, their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble. That was all to the good these days. Only three nights past, another mob had gathered at the gates of the Red Keep, chanting for food. Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them, slaying four, and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead. Winning us still more friends.\nTyrion was surprised to see Bronn standing beside the litter as well. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cDelivering your messages,\u201d Bronn said. \u201cIronhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the Gods. He won\u2019t say why. And you\u2019ve been summoned to Maegor\u2019s too.\u201d\n\u201cSummoned?\u201d Tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word. \u201cAnd what does Cersei want of me?\u201d\nBronn shrugged. \u201cThe queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her chambers. That stripling cousin of yours delivered the message. Four hairs on his lip and he thinks he\u2019s a man.\u201d\n\u201cFour hairs and a knighthood. He\u2019s Ser Lancel now, never forget.\u201d Tyrion knew that Ser Jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import. \u201cI\u2019d best see what Bywater wants. Inform my sister that I will attend her on my return.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t like that,\u201d Bronn warned.\n\u201cGood. The longer Cersei waits, the angrier she\u2019ll become, and anger makes her stupid. I much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning.\u201d Tyrion tossed his folded cloak into his litter, and Timett helped him up after it.\nThe market square inside the Gate of the Gods, which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables, was near deserted when Tyrion crossed it. Ser Jacelyn met him at the gate, and raised his iron hand in brusque salute. \u201cMy lord. Your cousin Cleos Frey is here, come from Riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark.\u201d\n\u201cPeace terms?\u201d\n\u201cSo he says.\u201d\n\u201cSweet cousin. Show me to him.\u201d\nThe gold cloaks had confined Ser Cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse. He rose when they entered. \u201cTyrion, you are a most welcome sight.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I hear often, cousin.\u201d\n\u201cHas Cersei come with you?\u201d\n\u201cMy sister is otherwise occupied. Is this Stark\u2019s letter?\u201d He plucked it off the table. \u201cSer Jacelyn, you may leave us.\u201d\nBywater bowed and departed. \u201cI was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent,\u201d Ser Cleos said as the door shut.\n\u201cI shall.\u201d Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with his letter. \u201cAll in good time, cousin. Sit. Rest. You look gaunt and haggard.\u201d He looked worse than that, in truth.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Ser Cleos lowered himself onto a bench. \u201cIt is bad in the riverlands, Tyrion. Around the Gods Eye and along the kingsroad especially. The river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us, and your father\u2019s foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword.\u201d\nThat was the way of war. The smallfolk were slaughtered, while the highborn were held for ransom. Remind me to thank the gods that I was bom a Lannister.\nSer Cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair. \u201cEven with a peace banner, we were attacked twice. Wolves in mail, hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves. The gods alone know what side they started on, but they\u2019re on their own side now. Lost three men, and twice as many wounded.\u201d\n\u201cWhat news of our foe?\u201d Tyrion turned his attention back to Stark\u2019s terms. The boy does not want too much. Only half the realm, the release of our captives, hostages, his father\u2019s sword\u2026 oh, yes, and his sisters.\n\u201cThe boy sits idle at Riverrun,\u201d Ser Cleos said. \u201cI think he fears to face your father in the field. His strength grows less each day. The river lords have departed, each to defend his own lands.\u201d\nIs this what Father intended? Tyrion rolled up Stark\u2019s map. \u201cThese terms will never do.\u201d\n\u201cWill you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem?\u201d Ser Cleos asked plaintively.\nTion Frey was his younger brother, Tyrion recalled. \u201cNo,\u201d he said gently, \u201cbut we\u2019ll propose our own exchange of captives. Let me consult with Cersei and the council. We shall send you back to Riverrun with our terms.\u201d\nClearly, the prospect did not cheer him. \u201cMy lord, I do not believe Robb Stark will yield easily. It is Lady Catelyn who wants this peace, not the boy.\u201d\n\u201cLady Catelyn wants her daughters.\u201d Tyrion pushed himself down from the bench, letter and map in hand. \u201cSer Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire. You look in dire need of sleep, cousin. I will send for you when we know more.\u201d\nHe found Ser Jacelyn on the ramparts, watching several hundred new recruits drilling in the field below. With so many seeking refuge in King\u2019s Landing, there was no lack of men willing to join the City Watch for a full belly and a bed of straw in the barracks, but Tyrion had no illusions about how well these ragged defenders of theirs would fight if it came to battle.\n\u201cYou did well to send for me,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cI shall leave Ser Cleos in your hands. He is to have every hospitality.\u201d\n\u201cAnd his escort?\u201d the commander wanted to know.\n\u201cGive them food and clean garb, and find a maester to see to their hurts. They are not to set foot inside the city, is that understood?\u201d It would never do to have the truth of conditions in King\u2019s Landing reach Robb Stark in Riverrun.\n\u201cWell understood, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and one more thing. The alchemists will be sending a large supply of clay pots to each of the city gates. You\u2019re to use them to train the men who will work your spitfires. Fill the pots with green paint and have them drill at loading and firing. Any man who spatters should be replaced. When they have mastered the paint pots, substitute lamp oil and have them work at lighting the jars and firing them while aflame. Once they learn to do that without burning themselves, they may be ready for wildfire.\u201d\nSer Jacelyn scratched at his cheek with his iron hand. \u201cWise measures. Though I have no love for that alchemist\u2019s piss.\u201d\n\u201cNor I, but I use what I\u2019m given.\u201d\nOnce back inside his litter, Tyrion Lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion under his elbow. Cersei would be displeased to learn that he had intercepted Stark\u2019s letter, but his father had sent him here to rule, not to please Cersei.\nIt seemed to him that Robb Stark had given them a golden chance. Let the boy wait at Riverrun dreaming of an easy peace. Tyrion would reply with terms of his own, giving the King in the North just enough of what he wanted to keep him hopeful. Let Ser Cleos wear out his bony Frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters. All the while, their cousin Ser Stafford would be training and arming the new host he\u2019d raised at Casterly Rock. Once he was ready, he and Lord Tywin could smash the Tullys and Starks between them.\nNow if only Robert\u2019s brothers would be so accommodating. Glacial as his progress was, still Renly Baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host, and scarcely a night passed that Tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that Lord Stannis was sailing his fleet up the Blackwater Rush. Well, it would seem I have a goodly stock of wildfire, but still\u2026\nThe sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries. Tyrion peered out cautiously between the curtains. They were passing through Cobbler\u2019s Square, where a sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet. A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers.\n\u201cCorruption!\u201d the man cried shrilly. \u201cThere is the warning! Behold the Father\u2019s scourge!\u201d He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky. From this vantage, the distant castle on Aegon\u2019s High Hill was directly behind him, with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers. A clever choice of stage, Tyrion reflected. \u201cWe have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters! Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all\u2026 but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the Whoremonger King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!\u201d He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle. \u201cThere comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!\u201d\n\u201cFire!\u201d other voices echoed, but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out. Tyrion took solace from that. He gave the command to continue, and the litter rocked like a ship on a rough sea as the Burned Men cleared a path. Twisted little monkey demon indeed. The wretch did have a point about the High Septon, to be sure. What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day? A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table. The memory of the fool\u2019s jape made Tyrion smile.\nHe was pleased to reach the Red Keep without further incident. As he climbed the steps to his chambers, Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn. Time, that\u2019s all I truly need, time to piece it all together. Once the chain is done\u2026 He opened the door to his solar.\nCersei turned away from the window, her skirts swirling around her slender hips. \u201cHow dare you ignore my summons!\u201d\n\u201cWho admitted you to my tower?\u201d\n\u201cYour tower? This is my son\u2019s royal castle.\u201d\n\u201cSo they tell me.\u201d Tyrion was not amused. Crawn would be even less so; his Moon Brothers had the guard today. \u201cI was about to come to you, as it happens.\u201d\n\u201cWere you?\u201d\nHe swung the door shut behind him. \u201cYou doubt me?\u201d\n\u201cAlways, and with good reason.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt.\u201d Tyrion waddled to the sideboard for a cup of wine. He knew no surer way to work up a thirst than talking with Cersei. \u201cIf I\u2019ve given you offense, I would know how.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a disgusting little worm you are. Myrcella is my only daughter. Did you truly imagine that I would allow you to sell her like a bag of oats? \u201c\nMyrcella, he thought. Well, that egg has hatched. Let\u2019s see what color the chick is. \u201cHardly a bag of oats. Myrcella is a princess. Some would say this is what she was born for. Or did you plan to marry her to Tommen?\u201d\nHer hand lashed out, knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor. \u201cBrother or no, I should have your tongue out for that. I am Joffrey\u2019s regent, not you, and I say that Myrcella will not be shipped off to this Dornishman the way I was shipped to Robert Baratheon.\u201d\nTyrion shook wine off his fingers and sighed. \u201cWhy not? She\u2019d be a deal safer in Dorne than she is here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you utterly ignorant or simply perverse? You know as well as I that the Martells have no cause to love us.\u201d\n\u201cThe Martells have every cause to hate us. Nonetheless, I expect them to agree. Prince Doran\u2019s grievance against House Lannister goes back only a generation, but the Dornishmen have warred against Storm\u2019s End and Highgarden for a thousand years, and Renly has taken Dorne\u2019s allegiance for granted. Myrcella is nine, Trystane Martell eleven. I have proposed they wed when she reaches her fourteenth year. Until such time, she would be an honored guest at Sunspear, under Prince Doran\u2019s protection.\u201d\n\u201cA hostage,\u201d Cersei said, mouth tightening.\n\u201cAn honored guest,\u201d Tyrion insisted, \u201cand I suspect Martell will treat Myrcella more kindly than Joffrey has treated Sansa Stark. I had in mind to send Ser Arys Oakheart with her. With a knight of the Kingsguard as her sworn shield, no one is like to forget who or what she is.\u201d\n\u201cSmall good Ser Arys will do her if Doran Martell decides that my daughter\u2019s death would wash out his sister\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cMartell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl, particularly one as sweet and innocent as Myrcella. So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we\u2019ll keep faith on our side, and the terms are too rich to refuse. Myrcella is the least part of it. I\u2019ve also offered him his sister\u2019s killer, a council seat, some castles on the Marches\u2026\u201d\n\u201cToo much.\u201d Cersei paced away from him, restless as a lioness, skirts swirling. \u201cYou\u2019ve offered too much, and without my authority or consent.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of. If I\u2019d offered less, he\u2019d likely spit in my face.\u201d\n\u201cToo much!\u201d Cersei insisted, whirling back.\n\u201cWhat would you have offered him, that hole between your legs?\u201d Tyrion said, his own anger flaring.\nThis time he saw the slap coming. His head snapped around with a crack. \u201cSweet sweet sister,\u201d he said, \u201cI promise you, that was the last time you will ever strike me.\u201d\nHis sister laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, little man. Do you think Father\u2019s letter keeps you safe? A piece of paper. Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too, for all the good it did him.\u201d\nEddard Stark did not have the City Watch, Tyrion thought, nor my clansmen, nor the sellswords that Bronn has hired. I do. Or so he hoped. Trusting in Varys, in Ser Jacelyn Bywater, in Bronn. Lord Stark had probably had his delusions as well.\nYet he said nothing. A wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier. Instead he poured a fresh cup of wine. \u201cHow safe do you think Myrcella will be if King\u2019s Landing falls? Renly and Stannis will mount her head beside yours.\u201d\nAnd Cersei began to cry.\nTyrion Lannister could not have been more astonished if Aegon the Conqueror himself had burst into the room, riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies. He had not seen his sister weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock. Awkwardly, he took a step toward her. When your sister cries, you were supposed to comfort her\u2026 but this was Cersei! He reached a tentative hand for her shoulder.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said, wrenching away. It should not have hurt, yet it did, more than any slap. Red-faced, as angry as she was grief-stricken, Cersei struggled for breath. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, not\u2026 not like this\u2026 not you.\u201d\nPolitely, Tyrion turned his back. \u201cI did not mean to frighten you. I promise you, nothing will happen to Myrcella.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she said behind him. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, to be soothed with empty promises. You told me you would free Jaime too. Well, where is he? \u201c\n\u201cIn Riverrun, I should imagine. Safe and under guard, until I find a way to free him.\u201d\nCersei sniffed. \u201cI should have been born a man. I would have no need of any of you then. None of this would have been allowed to happen. How could Jaime let himself be captured by that boy? And Father, I trusted in him, fool that I am, but where is he now that he\u2019s wanted? What is he doing?\u201d\n\u201cMaking war.\u201d\n\u201cFrom behind the walls of Harrenhal?\u201d she said scornfully. \u201cA curious way of fighting. It looks suspiciously like hiding.\u201d\n\u201cLook again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else would you call it? Father sits in one castle, and Robb Stark sits in another, and no one does anything.\u201d\n\u201cThere is sitting and there is sitting,\u201d Tyrion suggested. \u201cEach one waits for the other to move, but the lion is still, poised, his tail twitching, while the fawn is frozen by fear, bowels turned to jelly. No matter which way he bounds, the lion will have him, and he knows it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re quite certain that Father is the lion?\u201d\nTyrion grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s on all our banners.\u201d\nShe ignored the jest. \u201cIf it was Father who\u2019d been taken captive, Jaime would not be sitting by idly, I promise you.\u201d\nJaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun, and the Others take their chances. He never did have any patience, no more than you, sweet sister. \u201cNot all of us can be as bold as Jaime, but there are other ways to win wars. Harrenhal is strong and well situated.\u201d\n\u201cAnd King\u2019s Landing is not, as we both know perfectly well. While Father plays lion and fawn with the Stark boy, Renly marches up the roseroad. He could be at our gates any day now!\u201d\n\u201cThe city will not fall in a day. From Harrenhal it is a straight, swift march down the kingsroad. Renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before Father takes him in the rear. His host will be the hammer, the city walls the anvil. it makes a lovely picture.\u201d\nCersei\u2019s green eyes bored into him, wary, yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding her. \u201cAnd if Robb Stark marches?\u201d\n\u201cHarrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose Bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolf\u2019s horse. Stark cannot march on King\u2019s Landing without taking Harrenhal first, and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do that.\u201d Tyrion tried his most winning smile. \u201cMeanwhile Father lives off the fat of the riverlands, while our uncle Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock.\u201d\nCersei regarded him suspiciously. \u201cHow could you know all this? Did Father tell you his intentions when he sent you here?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I glanced at a map.\u201d\nHer look turned to disdain. \u201cYou\u2019ve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque head of yours, haven\u2019t you, Imp?\u201d\nTyrion tsked. \u201cSweet sister, I ask you, if we weren\u2019t winning, would the Starks have sued for peace?\u201d He drew out the letter that Ser Cleos Frey had brought. \u201cThe Young Wolf has sent us terms, you see. Unacceptable terms, to be sure, but still, a beginning. Would you care to see them?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d That fast, she was all queen again. \u201cHow do you come to have them? They should have come to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else is a Hand for, if not to hand you things?\u201d Tyrion handed her the letter. His cheek still throbbed where Cersei\u2019s hand had left its mark. Let her flay half my face, it will be a small price to pay for her consent to the Dornish marriage. He would have that now, he could sense it.\nAnd certain knowledge of an informer too\u2026 well, that was the plum in his pudding.",

      "content": "Bran\nDancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark, while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet, his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair. Over his heart was his wolf\u2019s-head brooch of silver and polished jet. He would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on his breast, but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding.\nThe low stone steps balked Dancer only for a moment. When Bran urged her on, she took them easily. Beyond the wide oak-and-iron doors, eight long rows of trestle tables filled Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall, four on each side of the center aisle. Men crowded shoulder to shoulder on the benches. \u201cStark!\u201d they called as Bran trotted past, rising to their feet. \u201cWinterfell! Winterfell!\u201d\nHe was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted for\u2014it was the harvest they cheered, it was Robb and his victories, it was his lord father and his grandfather and all the Starks going back eight thousand years. Still, it made him swell with pride. For so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken. Yet when he reached the dais, with every eye upon him, Osha and Hodor undid his straps and buckles, lifted him off Dancer\u2019s back, and carried him to the high seat of his fathers.\nSer Rodrik was seated to Bran\u2019s left, his daughter Beth beside him. Rickon was to his right, his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle. He had refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone. The last girl to try had been bitten for her efforts. \u201cI wanted to ride too,\u201d he said as Hodor led Dancer away. \u201cI ride better than you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, so hush up,\u201d he told his brother. Ser Rodrik bellowed for quiet. Bran raised his voice. He bid them welcome in the name of his brother, the King in the North, and asked them to thank the gods old and new for Robb\u2019s victories and the bounty of the harvest. \u201cMay there be a hundred more,\u201d he finished, raising his father\u2019s silver goblet.\n\u201cA hundred more!\u201d Pewter tankards, clay cups, and iron-banded drinking horns clashed together. Bran\u2019s wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves, but stronger than he was used to. He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest as he swallowed. By the time he set down the goblet, his head was swimming.\n\u201cYou did well, Bran,\u201d Ser Rodrik told him. \u201cLord Eddard would have been most proud.\u201d Down the table, Maester Luwin nodded his agreement as the servers began to carry in the food.\nSuch food Bran had never seen; course after course after course, so much that he could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish. There were great joints of aurochs roasted with leeks, venison pies chunky with carrots, bacon, and mushrooms, mutton chops sauced in honey and cloves, savory duck, peppered boar, goose, skewers of pigeon and capon, beef-and-barley stew, cold fruit soup. Lord Wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from White Harbor packed in salt and seaweed; whitefish and winkles, crabs and mussels, clams, herring, cod, salmon, lobster and lampreys. There was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits; there were turnips and pease and beets, beans and squash and huge red onions; there were baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine. Wheels of white cheese were set at every table, above and below the salt, and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn ale were passed up and down the tables.\nLord Wyman\u2019s musicians played bravely and well, but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter, the clash of cup and plate, and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps. The singer sang good songs, \u201cIron Lances\u201d and \u201cThe Burning of the Ships\u201d and \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair,\u201d but only Hodor seemed to be listening. He stood beside the piper, hopping from one foot to the other.\nThe noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar, a great heady stew of sound. Ser Rodrik talked with Maester Luwin above Beth\u2019s curly head, while Rickon screamed happily at the Walders. Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table, but the maester reminded him that they would soon be kin. Robb was to marry one of their aunts, and Arya one of their uncles. \u201cShe never will,\u201d Bran said, \u201cnot Arya,\u201d but Maester Luwin was unyielding, so there they were beside Rickon.\nThe serving men brought every dish to Bran first, that he might take the lord\u2019s portion if he chose. By the time they reached the ducks, he could eat no more. After that he nodded approval at each course in turn, and waved it away. If the dish smelled especially choice, he would send it to one of the lords on the dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must make. He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood, the boar to the boisterous Umbers, a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn, and a huge lobster to Joseth the master of horse, who was neither lord nor guest, but had seen to Dancer\u2019s training and made it possible for Bran to ride. He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them. Ser Rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster brothers, so he sent Little Walder some boiled beets and Big Walder the buttered turnips.\nOn the benches below, Winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town, friends from the nearer holdfasts, and the escorts of their lordly guests. Some faces Bran had never seen before, others he knew as well as his own, yet they all seemed equally foreign to him. He watched them as from a distance, as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber looking down on the yard below, seeing everything yet a part of nothing.\nOsha moved among the tables, pouring ale. One of Leobald Tallhart\u2019s men slid a hand up under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head, to roars of laughter. Yet Mikken had his hand down some woman\u2019s bodice, and she seemed not to mind. Bran watched Farlen make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers. On the dais, Lord Wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they were an enemy host. He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had commanded that a special wide chair be built for him to sit in, but he laughed loud and often, and Bran thought he liked him. Poor wan Lady Hornwood sat beside him, her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food. At the opposite end of the high table, Hothen and Mors were playing a drinking game, slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust.\nIt is too hot here, and too noisy, and they are all getting drunk. Bran itched under his grey and white woolens, and suddenly he wished he were anywhere but here. It is cool in the godswood now. Steam is rising off the hot pools, and the red leaves of the weirwood are rustling. The smells are richer than here, and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to it.\n\u201cBran?\u201d Ser Rodrik said. \u201cYou do not eat.\u201d\nThe waking dream had been so vivid, for a moment Bran had not known where he was. \u201cI\u2019ll have more later,\u201d he said. \u201cMy belly\u2019s full to bursting.\u201d\nThe old knight\u2019s white mustache was pink with wine. \u201cYou have done well, Bran. Here, and at the audiences. You will be an especial fine lord one day, I think.\u201d\nI want to be a knight. Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his father\u2019s goblet, grateful for something to clutch. The lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on the side of the cup. He felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm, and remembered the last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet.\nIt had been the night of the welcoming feast, when King Robert had brought his court to Winterfell. Summer still reigned then. His parents had shared the dais with Robert and his queen, with her brothers beside her. Uncle Benjen had been there too, all in black. Bran and his brothers and sisters sat with the king\u2019s children, Joffrey and Tommen and Princess Myrcella, who\u2019d spent the whole meal gazing at Robb with adoring eyes. Arya made faces across the table when no one was looking; Sansa listened raptly while the king\u2019s high harper sang songs of chivalry, and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn\u2019t with them. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bastard,\u201d Bran finally had to whisper to him.\nAnd now they are all gone. It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well\u2026\nEven down on the benches, there were new men at the tables. Jory was dead, and Fat Tom, and Porther, Alyn, Desmond, Hullen who had been master of horse, Harwin his son\u2026 all those who had gone south with his father, even Septa Mordane and Vayon Poole. The rest had ridden to war with Robb, and might soon be dead as well for all Bran knew. He liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough, but he missed his old friends.\nHe looked up and down the benches at all the faces happy and sad, and wondered who would be missing next year and the year after. He might have cried then, but he couldn\u2019t. He was the Stark in Winterfell, his father\u2019s son and his brother\u2019s heir, and almost a man grown.\nAt the foot of the hall, the doors opened and a gust of cold air made the torches flame brighter for an instant. Alebelly led two new guests into the feast. \u201cThe Lady Meera of House Reed,\u201d the rotund guardsman bellowed over the clamor. \u201cWith her brother, Jojen, of Greywater Watch.\u201d\nMen looked up from their cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers. Bran heard Little Walder mutter, \u201cFrogeaters,\u201d to Big Walder beside him. Ser Rodrik climbed to his feet. \u201cBe welcome, friends, and share this harvest with us.\u201d Serving men hurried to lengthen the table on the dais, fetching trestles and chairs.\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d Rickon asked.\n\u201cMudmen,\u201d answered Little Walder disdainfully. \u201cThey\u2019re thieves and cravens, and they have green teeth from eating frogs.\u201d\nMaester Luwin crouched beside Bran\u2019s seat to whisper counsel in his ear. \u201cYou must greet these ones warmly. I had not thought to see them here, but\u2026 you know who they are?\u201d\nBran nodded. \u201cCrannogmen. From the Neck.\u201d\n\u201cHowland Reed was a great friend to your father,\u201d Ser Rodrik told him. \u201cThese two are his, it would seem.\u201d\nAs the newcomers walked the length of the hall, Bran saw that one was indeed a girl, though he would never have known it by her dress. She wore lambskin breeches soft with long use, and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales. Though near Robb\u2019s age, she was slim as a boy, with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of breasts. A woven net hung from one slim hip, a long bronze knife from the other; under her arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust; a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back.\nHer brother was several years younger and bore no weapons. All his garb was green, even to the leather of his boots, and when he came closer Bran saw that his eyes were the color of moss, though his teeth looked as white as anyone else\u2019s. Both Reeds were slight of build, slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself. They went to one knee before the dais.\n\u201cMy lords of Stark,\u201d the girl said. \u201cThe years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North. My lord father has sent us here to say the words again, for all our people.\u201d\nShe is looking at me, Bran realized. He had to make some answer. \u201cMy brother Robb is fighting in the south,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can say your words to me, if you like.\u201d\n\u201cTo Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater,\u201d they said together. \u201cHearth and heart and harvest we yield up to you, my lord. Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command. Grant mercy to our weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and we shall never fail you.\u201d\n\u201cI swear it by earth and water,\u201d said the boy in green.\n\u201cI swear it by bronze and iron,\u201d his sister said.\n\u201cWe swear it by ice and fire,\u201d they finished together.\nBran groped for words. Was he supposed to swear something back to them? Their oath was not one he had been taught. \u201cMay your winters be short and your summers bountiful,\u201d he said. That was usually a good thing to say. \u201cRise. I\u2019m Brandon Stark.\u201d\nThe girl, Meera, got to her feet and helped her brother up. The boy stared at Bran all the while. \u201cWe bring you gifts of fish and frog and fowl,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI thank you.\u201d Bran wondered if he would have to eat a frog to be polite. \u201cI offer you the meat and mead of Winterfell.\u201d He tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen, who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands. They were a poor folk, fishers and frog-hunters who lived in houses of thatch and woven reeds on floating islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp. It was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open battle. And yet Howland Reed had been one of Father\u2019s staunchest companions during the war for King Robert\u2019s crown, before Bran was born.\nThe boy, Jojen, looked about the hall curiously as he took his seat. \u201cWhere are the direwolves?\u201d\n\u201cIn the godswood,\u201d Rickon answered. \u201cShaggy was bad.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother would like to see them,\u201d the girl said.\nLittle Walder spoke up loudly. \u201cHe\u2019d best watch they don\u2019t see him, or they\u2019ll take a bite out of him.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t bite if I\u2019m there.\u201d Bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves. \u201cSummer won\u2019t anyway, and he\u2019ll keep Shaggydog away.\u201d He was curious about these mudmen. He could not recall ever seeing one before. His father had sent letters to the Lord of Greywater over the years, but none of the crannogmen had ever called at Winterfell. He would have liked to talk to them more, but the Great Hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear anyone who wasn\u2019t right beside you.\nSer Rodrik was right beside Bran. \u201cDo they truly eat frogs?\u201d he asked the old knight.\n\u201cAye,\u201d Ser Rodrik said. \u201cFrogs and fish and lizard-lions, and all manner of birds.\u201d\nMaybe they don\u2019t have sheep and cattle, Bran thought. He commanded the serving men to bring them mutton chops and a slice off the aurochs and fill their trenchers with beef-and-barley stew. They seemed to like that well enough. The girl caught him staring at her and smiled. Bran blushed and looked away.\nMuch later, after all the sweets had been served and washed down with gallons of surnmerwine, the food was cleared and the tables shoved back against the walls to make room for the dancing. The music grew wilder, the drummers joined in, and Hother Umber brought forth a huge curved warhorn banded in silver. When the singer reached the part in \u201cThe Night That Ended\u201d where the Night\u2019s Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the Battle for the Dawn, he blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking.\nTwo Glover men began a spinning skirl on bladder and woodharp. Mors Umber was the first on his feet. He seized a passing serving girl by the arm, knocking the flagon of wine out of her hands to shatter on the floor. Amidst the rushes and bones and bits of bread that littered the stone, he whirled her and spun her and tossed her in the air. The girl squealed with laughter and turned red as her skirts swirled and lifted.\nOthers soon joined in. Hodor began to dance all by himself, while Lord Wyman asked little Beth Cassel to partner him. For all his size, he moved gracefully. When he tired, Cley Cerwyn danced with the child in his stead. Ser Rodrik approached Lady Hornwood, but she made her excuses and took her leave. Bran watched long enough to be polite, and then had Hodor summoned. He was hot and tired, flushed from the wine, and the dancing made him sad. it was something else he could never do. \u201cI want to go.\u201d\n\u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor shouted back, kneeling. Maester Luwin and Hayhead lifted him into his basket. The folk of Winterfell had seen this sight half a hundred times, but doubtless it looked queer to the guests, some of whom were more curious than polite. Bran felt the stares.\nThey went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall, Bran ducking his head as they passed through the lord\u2019s door. In the dim-lit gallery outside the Great Hall, they came upon Joseth the master of horse engaged in a different sort of riding. He had some woman Bran did not know shoved up against the wall, her skirts around her waist. She was giggling until Hodor stopped to watch. Then she screamed. \u201cLeave them be, Hodor,\u201d Bran had to tell him. \u201cTake me to my bedchamber.\u201d\nHodor carried him up the winding steps to his tower and knelt beside one of the iron bars that Mikken had driven into the wall. Bran used the bars to move himself to the bed, and Hodor pulled off his boots and breeches. \u201cYou can go back to the feast now, but don\u2019t go bothering Joseth and that woman,\u201d Bran said.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor replied, bobbing his head.\nWhen he blew out his bedside candle, darkness covered him like a soft, familiar blanket. The faint sound of music drifted through his shuttered window.\nSomething his father had told him once when he was little came back to him suddenly. He had asked Lord Eddard if the Kingsguard were truly the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms. \u201cNo longer,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut once they were a marvel, a shining lesson to the world.\u201d\n\u201cWas there one who was best of all?\u201d\n\u201cThe finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed.\u201d Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant.\nHe went to sleep with his head full of knights in gleaming armor, fighting with swords that shone like starfire, but when the dream came he was in the godswood again. The smells from the kitchen and the Great Hall were so strong that it was almost as if he had never left the feast. He prowled beneath the trees, his brother close behind him. This night was wildly alive, full of the howling of the man-pack at their play. The sounds made him restless. He wanted to run, to hunt, he wanted to\u2014\nThe rattle of iron made his ears prick up. His brother heard it too. They raced through the undergrowth toward the sound. Bounding across the still water at the foot of the old white one, he caught the scent of a stranger, the man-smell well mixed with leather and earth and iron.\nThe intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon them; a female and a young male, with no taint of fear to them, even when he showed them the white of his teeth. His brother growled low in his throat, yet still they did not run.\n\u201cHere they come,\u201d the female said. Meera, some part of him whispered, some wisp of the sleeping boy lost in the wolf dream. \u201cDid you know they would be so big?\u201d\n\u201cThey will be bigger still before they are grown,\u201d the young male said, watching them with eyes large, green, and unafraid. \u201cThe black one is full of fear and rage, but the grey is strong\u2026 stronger than he knows\u2026 can you feel him, sister?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore. \u201cGo careful, Joien.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me. This is not the day I die.\u201d The male walked toward them, unafraid, and reached out for his muzzle, a touch as light as a summer breeze. Yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing, and then he was spinning and falling, falling, falling\u2026",

      "content": "Catelyn\nAs she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at her breast. Robb, crownless, played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in her bed, smiling.\nSweet it was, sweet and gone too soon. Dawn came cruel, a dagger of light. She woke aching and alone and weary; weary of riding, weary of hurting, weary of duty. I want to weep, she thought. I want to be comforted. I\u2019m so tired of being strong. I want to be foolish and frightened for once. Just for a small while, that\u2019s all\u2026 a day\u2026 an hour\u2026\nOutside her tent, men were stirring. She heard the whicker of horses, Shadd complaining of stiffness in his back, Ser Wendel calling for his bow. Catelyn wished they would all go away. They were good men, loyal, yet she was tired of them all. It was her children she yearned after. One day, she promised herself as she lay abed, one day she would allow herself to be less than strong.\nBut not today. It could not be today.\nHer fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as she fumbled on her clothes. She supposed she ought to be grateful that she had any use of her hands at all. The dagger had been Valyrian steel, and Valyrian steel bites deep and sharp. She had only to look at the scars to remember.\nOutside, Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle, while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing his bow. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said when Catelyn emerged. \u201cThere are birds in this grass. Would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning?\u201d\n\u201cOats and bread are sufficient\u2026 for all of us, I think. We have many leagues yet to ride, Ser Wendel.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, my lady.\u201d The knight\u2019s moon face looked crestfallen, the tips of his great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment. \u201cOats and bread, and what could be better?\u201d He was one of the fattest men Catelyn had ever known, but howevermuch he loved his food, he loved his honor more.\n\u201cFound some nettles and brewed a tea,\u201d Shadd announced. \u201cWill m\u2019lady take a cup?\u201d\n\u201cYes, with thanks.\u201d\nShe cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it. Shadd was one of the Winterfell men. Robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to Renly. He had sent five lordlings as well, whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission. As they made their way south, staying well clear of towns and holdfasts, they had seen bands of mailed men more than once, and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon, but none had dared molest them. They were too weak to be a threat, too many to be easy prey. Once across the Blackwater, the worst was behind. For the past four days, they had seen no signs of war.\nCatelyn had never wanted this. She had told Robb as much, back in Riverrun. \u201cWhen last I saw Renly, he was a boy no older than Bran. I do not know him. Send someone else. My place is here with my father, for whatever time he has left.\u201d\nHer son had looked at her unhappily. \u201cThere is no one else. I cannot go myself. Your father\u2019s too ill. The Blackfish is my eyes and ears, I dare not lose him. Your brother I need to hold Riverrun when we march\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMarch?\u201d No one had said a word to her of marching.\n\u201cI cannot sit at Riverrun waiting for peace. It makes me look as if I were afraid to take the field again. When there are no battles to fight, men start to think of hearth and harvest, Father told me that. Even my northmen grow restless.\u201d\nMy northmen, she thought. He is even starting to talk like a king. \u201cNo one has ever died of restlessness, but rashness is another matter. We\u2019ve planted seeds, let them grow.\u201d\nRobb shook his head stubbornly. \u201cWe\u2019ve tossed some seeds in the wind, that\u2019s all. if your sister Lysa was coming to aid us, we would have heard by now. How many birds have we sent to the Eyrie, four? I want peace too, but why should the Lannisters give me anything if all I do is sit here while my army melts away around me swift as summer snow?\u201d\n\u201cSo rather than look craven, you will dance to Lord Tywin\u2019s pipes?\u201d she threw back. \u201cHe wants you to march on Harrenhal, ask your uncle Brynden if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said nothing of Harrenhal,\u201d Robb said. \u201cNow, will you go to Renly for me, or must I send the Greatjon?\u201d\nThe memory brought a wan smile to her face. Such an obvious ploy, that, yet deft for a boy of fifteen. Robb knew how ill-suited a man like Greatjon Umber would be to treat with a man like Renly Baratheon, and he knew that she knew it as well. What could she do but accede, praying that her father would live until her return? Had Lord Hoster been well, he would have gone himself, she knew. Still, that leavetaking was hard, hard. He did not even know her when she came to say farewell. \u201cMinisa,\u201d he called her, \u201cwhere are the children? My little Cat, my sweet Lysa\u2026\u201d Catelyn had kissed him on the brow and told him his babes were well. \u201cWait for me, my lord,\u201d she said as his eyes closed. \u201cI waited for you, oh, so many times. Now you must wait for me.\u201d\nFate drives me south and south again, Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea, when it is north I should be going, north to home. She had written to Bran and Rickon, that last night at Riverrun. I do not forget you, my sweet ones, you must believe that. It is only that your brother needs me more.\n\u201cWe ought to reach the upper Mander today, my lady,\u201d Ser Wendel announced while Shadd spooned out the porridge. \u201cLord Renly will not be far, if the talk be true.\u201d\nAnd what do I tell him when I find him? That my son holds him no true king? She did not relish this meeting. They needed friends, not more enemies, yet Robb would never bend the knee in homage to a man he felt had no claim to the throne.\nHer bowl was empty, though she could scarce remember tasting the porridge. She laid it aside. \u201cIt is time we were away.\u201d The sooner she spoke to Renly, the sooner she could turn for home. She was the first one mounted, and she set the pace for the column. Hal Mollen rode beside her, bearing the banner of House Stark, the grey direwolf on an ice-white field.\nThey were still a half day\u2019s ride from Renly\u2019s camp when they were taken. Robin Flint had ranged ahead to scout, and he came galloping back with word of a far-eyes watching from the roof of a distant windmill. By the time Catelyn\u2019s party reached the mill, the man was long gone. They pressed on, covering not quite a mile before Renly\u2019s outriders came swooping down on them, twenty men mailed and mounted, led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with bluejays on his surcoat.\nWhen he saw her banners, he trotted up to her alone. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he called, \u201cI am Ser Colen of Greenpools, as it please you. These are dangerous lands you cross.\u201d\n\u201cOur business is urgent,\u201d she answered him. \u201cI come as envoy from my son, Robb Stark, the King in the North, to treat with Renly Baratheon, the King in the South.\u201d\n\u201cKing Renly is the crowned and anointed lord of all the Seven Kingdoms, my lady,\u201d Ser Colen answered, though courteously enough. \u201cHis Grace is encamped with his host near Bitterbridge, where the roseroad crosses the Mander. It shall be my great honor to escort you to him.\u201d The knight raised a mailed hand, and his men formed a double column flanking Catelyn and her guard. Escort or captor? she wondered. There was nothing to be done but trust in Ser Colen\u2019s honor, and Lord Renly\u2019s.\nThey saw the smoke of the camp\u2019s fires when they were still an hour from the river. Then the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain, indistinct as the murmur of some distant sea, but swelling as they rode closer. By the time they caught sight of the Mander\u2019s muddy waters glinting in the sun, they could make out the voices of men, the clatter of steel, the whinny of horses. Yet neither sound nor smoke prepared them for the host itself.\nThousands of cookfires filled the air with a pale smoky haze. The horse lines alone stretched out over leagues. A forest had surely been felled to make the tall staffs that held the banners. Great siege engines lined the grassy verge of the roseroad, mangonels and trebuchets and rolling rams mounted on wheels taller than a man on horseback. The steel points of pikes flamed red with sunlight, as if already blooded, while the pavilions of the knights and high lords sprouted from the grass like silken mushrooms. She saw men with spears and men with swords, men in steel caps and mail shirts, camp followers strutting their charms, archers fletching arrows, teamsters driving wagons, swineherds driving pigs, pages running messages, squires honing swords, knights riding palfreys, grooms leading ill-tempered destriers. \u201cThis is a fearsome lot of men,\u201d Ser Wendel Manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span from which Bitterbridge took its name.\n\u201cThat it is,\u201d Catelyn agreed.\nNear all the chivalry of the south had come to Renly\u2019s call, it seemed. The golden rose of Highgarden was seen everywhere: sewn on the right breast of armsmen and servants, flapping and fluttering from the green silk banners that adorned lance and pike, painted upon the shields hung outside the pavilions of the sons and brothers and cousins and uncles of House Tyrell. As well Catelyn spied the fox-and-flowers of House Florent, Fossoway apples red and green, Lord Tarly\u2019s striding huntsman, oak leaves for Oakheart, cranes for Crane, a cloud of black-and-orange butterflies for the Mullendores.\nAcross the Mander, the storm lords had raised their standards\u2014Renly\u2019s own bannermen, sworn to House Baratheon and Storm\u2019s End. Catelyn recognized Bryce Caron\u2019s nightingales, the Penrose quills, and Lord Estermont\u2019s sea turtle, green on green. Yet for every shield she knew, there were a dozen strange to her, borne by the small lords sworn to the bannermen, and by hedge knights and freeriders, who had come swarming to make Renly Baratheon a king in fact as well as name.\nRenly\u2019s own standard flew high over all. From the top of his tallest siege tower, a wheeled oaken immensity covered with rawhides, streamed the largest war banner that Catelyn had ever seen\u2014a cloth big enough to carpet many a hall, shimmering gold, with the crowned stag of Baratheon black upon it, prancing proud and tall.\n\u201cMy lady, do you hear that noise?\u201d asked Hallis Mollen, trotting close. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nShe listened. Shouts, and horses screaming, and the clash of steel, and\u2026\u201cCheering,\u201d she said. They had been riding up a gentle slope toward a line of brightly colored pavilions on the height. As they passed between them, the press of men grew thicker, the sounds louder. And then she saw.\nBelow, beneath the stone-and-timber battlements of a small castle, a melee was in progress.\nA field had been cleared off, fences and galleries and tilting barriers thrown up. Hundreds were gathered to watch, perhaps thousands. From the looks of the grounds, torn and muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances, they had been at it for a day or more, but now the end was near. Fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse, charging and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered them on. She saw two destriers collide in full armor, going down in a tangle of steel and horseflesh. \u201cA tourney,\u201d Hal Mollen declared. He had a penchant for loudly announcing the obvious.\n\u201cOh, splendid,\u201d Ser Wendel Manderly said as a knight in a rainbow-striped cloak wheeled to deliver a backhand blow with a long-handled axe that shattered the shield of the man pursuing him and sent him reeling in his stirrups.\nThe press in front of them made further progress difficult. \u201cLady Stark,\u201d Ser Colen said, \u201cif your men would be so good as to wait here, I\u2019ll present you to the king.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d She gave the command, though she had to raise her voice to be heard above the tourney din. Ser Colen walked his horse slowly through the throngs, with Catelyn riding in his wake. A roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless red-bearded man with a griffin on his shield went down before a big knight in blue armor. His steel was a deep cobalt, even the blunt morningstar he wielded with such deadly effect, his mount barded in the quartered sun-and-moon heraldry of House Tarth.\n\u201cRed Ronnet\u2019s down, gods be damned,\u201d a man cursed.\n\u201cLoras\u2019ll do for that blue\u2014\u201d a companion answered before a roar drowned out the rest of his words.\nAnother man was fallen, trapped beneath his injured horse, both of them screaming in pain. Squires rushed out to aid them.\nThis is madness, Catelyn thought. Real enemies on every side and half the realm in flames, and Renly sits here playing at war like a boy with his first wooden sword.\nThe lords and ladies in the gallery were as engrossed in the melee as the men on the ground. Catelyn marked them well. Her father had oft treated with the southron lords, and not a few had been guests at Riverrun. She recognized Lord Mathis Rowan, stouter and more florid than ever, the golden tree of his House spread across his white doublet. Below him sat Lady Oakheart, tiny and delicate, and to her left Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill, his greatsword Heartsbane propped up against the back of his seat. Others she knew only by their sigils, and some not at all.\nIn their midst, watching and laughing with his young queen by his side, sat a ghost in a golden crown.\nSmall wonder the lords gather around him with such fervor, she thought, he is Robert come again. Renly was handsome as Robert had been handsome; long of limb and broad of shoulder, with the same coal-black hair, fine and straight, the same deep blue eyes, the same easy smile. The slender circlet around his brows seemed to suit him well. It was soft gold, a ring of roses exquisitely wrought; at the front lifted a stag\u2019s head of dark green jade, adorned with golden eyes and golden antlers.\nThe crowned stag decorated the king\u2019s green velvet tunic as well, worked in gold thread upon his chest; the Baratheon sigil in the colors of Highgarden. The girl who shared the high seat with him was also of Highgarden: his young queen, Margaery, daughter to Lord Mace Tyrell. Their marriage was the mortar that held the great southron alliance together, Catelyn knew. Renly was one-and-twenty, the girl no older than Robb, very pretty, with a doe\u2019s soft eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about her shoulders in lazy ringlets. Her smile was shy and sweet.\nOut in the field, another man lost his seat to the knight in the rainbow-striped cloak, and the king shouted approval with the rest. \u201cLoras!\u201d she heard him call. \u201cLoras! Highgarden!\u201d The queen clapped her hands together in excitement.\nCatelyn turned to see the end of it. Only four men were left in the fight now, and there was small doubt whom king and commons favored. She had never met Ser Loras Tyrell, but even in the distant north one heard tales of the prowess of the young Knight of Flowers. Ser Loras rode a tall white stallion in silver mail, and fought with a long-handled axe. A crest of golden roses ran down the center of his helm.\nTwo of the other survivors had made common cause. They spurred their mounts toward the knight in the cobalt armor. As they closed to either side, the blue knight reined hard, smashing one man full in the face with his splintered shield while his black destrier lashed out with a steel-shod hoof at the other. In a blink, one combatant was unhorsed, the other reeling. The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his left arm, and then the Knight of Flowers was on him. The weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about him.\nThe white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest dance, the riders throwing steel in place of kisses. Longaxe flashed and morningstar whirled. Both weapons were blunted, yet still they raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting much the worse of it. Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and shoulders, to shouts of \u201cHighgarden!\u201d from the throng. The other gave answer with his morningstar, but whenever the ball came crashing in, Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield, emblazoned with three golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight\u2019s hand on the backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp, the crowd screamed like a rutting beast. The Knight of Flowers raised his axe for the final blow.\nThe blue knight charged into it. The stallions slammed together, the blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate\u2026 but somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steel-gauntleted fingers. He wrenched it from Ser Loras\u2019s hand, and suddenly the two were grappling mount-to-mount, and an instant later they were falling. As their horses pulled apart, they crashed to the ground with bone-jarring force. Loras Tyrell, on the bottom, took the brunt of the impact. The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open Tyrell\u2019s visor. The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear what Ser Loras said, but she saw the word form on his split, bloody lips. Yield.\nThe blue knight climbed unsteady to his feet, and raised his dirk in the direction of Renly Baratheon, the salute of a champion to his king. Squires dashed onto the field to help the vanquished knight to his feet. When they got his helm off, Catelyn was startled to see how young he was. He could not have had more than two years on Robb. The boy might have been as comely as his sister, but the broken lip, unfocused eyes, and blood trickling through his matted hair made it hard to be certain.\n\u201cApproach,\u201d King Renly called to the champion.\nHe limped toward the gallery. At close hand, the brilliant blue armor looked rather less splendid; everywhere it showed scars, the dents of mace and warhammer, the long gouges left by swords, chips in the enameled breastplate and helm. His cloak hung in rags. From the way he moved, the man within was no less battered. A few voices hailed him with cries of \u201cTarth!\u201d and, oddly, \u201cA Beauty! A Beauty!\u201d but most were silent. The blue knight knelt before the king. \u201cGrace,\u201d he said, his voice muffled by his dented greathelm.\n\u201cYou are all your lord father claimed you were.\u201d Renly\u2019s voice carried over the field. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Ser Loras unhorsed once or twice\u2026 but never quite in that fashion.\u201d\n\u201cThat were no proper unhorsing,\u201d complained a drunken archer nearby, a Tyrell rose sewn on his jerkin. \u201cA vile trick, pulling the lad down.\u201d\nThe press had begun to open up. \u201cSer Colen,\u201d Catelyn said to her escort, \u201cwho is this man, and why do they mislike him so?\u201d\nSer Colen frowned. \u201cBecause he is no man, my lady. That\u2019s Brienne of Tarth, daughter to Lord Selwyn the Evenstar.\u201d\n\u201cDaughter?\u201d Catelyn was horrified.\n\u201cBrienne the Beauty, they name her\u2026 though not to her face, lest they be called upon to defend those words with their bodies.\u201d\nShe heard King Renly declare the Lady Brienne of Tarth the victor of the great melee at Bitterbridge, last mounted of one hundred sixteen knights. \u201cAs champion, you may ask of me any boon that you desire. If it lies in my power, it is yours.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Brienne answered, \u201cI ask the honor of a place among your Rainbow Guard. I would be one of your seven, and pledge my life to yours, to go where you go, ride at your side, and keep you safe from all hurt and harm.\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d he said. \u201cRise, and remove your helm.\u201d\nShe did as he bid her. And when the greathelm was lifted, Catelyn understood Ser Colen\u2019s words.\nBeauty, they called her\u2026 mocking. The hair beneath the visor was a squirrel\u2019s nest of dirty straw, and her face\u2026 Brienne\u2019s eyes were large and very blue, a young girl\u2019s eyes, trusting and guileless, but the rest\u2026 her features were broad and coarse, her teeth prominent and crooked, her mouth too wide, her lips so plump they seemed swollen. A thousand freckles speckled her cheeks and brow, and her nose had been broken more than once. Pity filled Catelyn\u2019s heart. Is there any creature on earth as unfortunate as an ugly woman?\nAnd yet, when Renly cut away her torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in its place, Brienne of Tarth did not look unfortunate. Her smile lit up her face, and her voice was strong and proud as she said, \u201cMy life for yours, Your Grace. From this day on, I am your shield, I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d The way she looked at the king\u2014looked down at him, she was a good hand higher, though Renly was near as tall as his brother had been\u2014was painful to see.\n\u201cYour Grace!\u201d Ser Colen of Greenpools swung down off his horse to approach the gallery. \u201cI beg your leave.\u201d He went to one knee. \u201cI have the honor to bring you the Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cLord of Winterfell and King in the North, ser,\u201d Catelyn corrected him. She dismounted and moved to Ser Colen\u2019s side.\nKing Renly looked surprised. \u201cLady Catelyn? We are most pleased.\u201d He turned to his young queen. \u201cMargaery my sweet, this is the Lady Catelyn Stark of Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cYou are most welcome here, Lady Stark,\u201d the girl said, all soft courtesy. \u201cI am sorry for your loss.\u201d\n\u201cYou are kind,\u201d said Catelyn.\n\u201cMy lady, I swear to you, I will see that the Lannisters answer for your husband\u2019s murder,\u201d the king declared. \u201cWhen I take King\u2019s Landing, I\u2019ll send you Cersei\u2019s head.\u201d\nAnd will that bring my Ned back to me? she thought. \u201cIt will be enough to know that justice has been done, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Brienne the Blue corrected sharply. \u201cAnd you should kneel when you approach the king.\u201d\n\u201cThe distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my lady,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cLord Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If you wish, we may stand here in the mud and debate what honors and titles are rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters to consider.\u201d\nSome of Renly\u2019s lords bristled at that, but the king only laughed. \u201cWell said, my lady. There will be time enough for graces when these wars are done. Tell me, when does your son mean to march against Harrenhal?\u201d\nUntil she knew whether this king was friend or foe, Catelyn was not about to reveal the least part of Robb\u2019s dispositions. \u201cI do not sit on my son\u2019s war councils, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cSo long as he leaves a few Lannisters for me, I\u2019ll not complain. What has he done with the Kingslayer?\u201d\n\u201cJaime Lannister is held prisoner at Riverrun.\u201d\n\u201cStill alive?\u201d Lord Mathis Rowan seemed dismayed.\nBemused, Renly said, \u201cIt would seem the direwolf is gentler than the lion.\u201d\n\u201cGentler than the Lannisters,\u201d murmured Lady Oakheart with a bitter smile, \u201cis drier than the sea.\u201d\n\u201cI call it weak.\u201d Lord Randyll Tarly had a short, bristly grey beard and a reputation for blunt speech. \u201cNo disrespect to you, Lady Stark, but it would have been more seemly had Lord Robb come to pay homage to the king himself, rather than hiding behind his mother\u2019s skirts.\u201d\n\u201cKing Robb is warring, my lord,\u201d Catelyn replied with icy courtesy, \u201cnot playing at tourney.\u201d\nRenly grinned. \u201cGo softly, Lord Randyll, I fear you\u2019re overmatched.\u201d He summoned a steward in the livery of Storm\u2019s End. \u201cFind a place for the lady\u2019s companions, and see that they have every comfort. Lady Catelyn shall have my own pavilion. Since Lord Caswell has been so kind as to give me use of his castle, I have no need of it. My lady, when you are rested, I would be honored if you would share our meat and mead at the feast Lord Caswell is giving us tonight. A farewell feast. I fear his lordship is eager to see the heels of my hungry horde.\u201d\n\u201cNot true, Your Grace,\u201d protested a wispy young man who must have been Caswell. \u201cWhat is mine is yours.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever someone said that to my brother Robert, he took them at their word,\u201d Renly said. \u201cDo you have daughters?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Your Grace. Two.\u201d\n\u201cThen thank the gods that I am not Robert. My sweet queen is all the woman I desire.\u201d Renly held out his hand to help Margaery to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again when you\u2019ve had a chance to refresh yourself, Lady Catelyn.\u201d\nRenly led his bride back toward the castle while his steward conducted Catelyn to the king\u2019s green silk pavilion. \u201cIf you have need of anything, you have only to ask, my lady.\u201d\nCatelyn could scarcely imagine what she might need that had not already been provided. The pavilion was larger than the common rooms of many an inn and furnished with every comfort: feather mattress and sleeping furs, a wood-and-copper tub large enough for two, braziers, to keep off the night\u2019s chill, slung leather camp chairs, a writing table with quills and inkpot, bowls of peaches, plums, and pears, a flagon of wine with a set of matched silver cups, cedar chests packed full of Renly\u2019s clothing, books, maps, game boards, a high harp, a tall bow and a quiver of arrows, a pair of red-tailed hunting hawks, a vertible armory of fine weapons. He does not stint himself, this Renly, she thought as she looked about. Small wonder this host moves so slowly.\nBeside the entrance, the king\u2019s armor stood sentry; a suit of forest-green plate, its fittings chased with gold, the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers. The steel was polished to such a high sheen that she could see her reflection in the breastplate, gazing back at her as if from the bottom of a deep green pond. The face of a drowned woman, Catelyn thought. Can you drown in grief? She turned away sharply, angry with her own frailty. She had no time for the luxury of self-pity. She must wash the dust from her hair and change into a gown more fitting for a king\u2019s feast.\nSer Wendel Manderly, Lucas Blackwood, Ser Perwyn Frey, and the rest of her highborn companions accompanied her to the castle. The great hall of Lord Caswell\u2019s keep was great only by courtesy, yet room was found on the crowded benches for Catelyn\u2019s men, amidst Renly\u2019s own knights. Catelyn was assigned a place on the dais between red-faced Lord Mathis Rowan and genial Ser Jon Fossoway of the green-apple Fossoways. Ser Jon made jests, while Lord Mathis inquired politely after the health of her father, brother, and children.\nBrienne of Tarth had been seated at the far end of the high table. She did not gown herself as a lady, but chose a knight\u2019s finery instead, a velvet doublet quartered rose-and-azure, breeches and boots and a fine-tooled swordbelt, her new rainbow cloak flowing down her back. No garb could disguise her plainness, though; the huge freckled hands, the wide flat face, the thrust of her teeth. Out of armor, her body seemed ungainly, broad of hip and thick of limb, with hunched muscular shoulders but no bosom to speak of. And it was clear from her every action that Brienne knew it, and suffered for it. She spoke only in answer, and seldom lifted her gaze from her food.\nOf food there was plenty. The war had not touched the fabled bounty of Highgarden. While singers sang and tumblers tumbled, they began with pears poached in wine, and went on to tiny savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms. There were great loaves of brown bread, mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and pease, immense hams and roast geese and trenchers dripping full of venison stewed with beer and barley. For the sweet, Lord Caswell\u2019s servants brought down trays of pastries from his castle kitchens, cream swans and spun-sugar unicorns, lemon cakes in the shape of roses, spiced honey biscuits and blackberry tarts, apple crisps and wheels of buttery cheese.\nThe rich foods made Catelyn queasy, but it would never do to show frailty when so much depended on her strength. She ate sparingly, while she watched this man who would be king. Renly sat with his young bride on his left hand and her brother on the right. Apart from the white linen bandage around his brow, Ser Loras seemed none the worse for the day\u2019s misadventures. He was indeed as comely as Catelyn had suspected he might be. When not glazed, his eyes were lively and intelligent, his hair an artless tumble of brown locks that many a maid might have envied. He had replaced his tattered tourney cloak with a new one; the same brilliantly striped silk of Renly\u2019s Rainbow Guard, clasped with the golden rose of Highgarden.\nFrom time to time, King Renly would feed Margaery some choice morsel off the point of his dagger, or lean over to plant the lightest of kisses on her cheek, but it was Ser Loras who shared most of his jests and confidences. The king enjoyed his food and drink, that was plain to see, yet he seemed neither glutton nor drunkard. He laughed often, and well, and spoke amiably to highborn lords and lowly serving wenches alike.\nSome of his guests were less moderate. They drank too much and boasted too loudly, to her mind. Lord Willum\u2019s sons Josua and Elyas disputed heatedly about who would be first over the walls of King\u2019s Landing. Lord Varner dandled a serving girl on his lap, nuzzling at her neck while one hand went exploring down her bodice. Guyard the Green, who fancied himself a singer, diddled a harp and gave them a verse about tying lions\u2019 tails in knots, parts of which rhymed. Ser Mark Mullendore brought a black-and-white monkey and fed him morsels from his own plate, while Ser Tanton of the red-apple Fossoways climbed on the table and swore to slay Sandor Clegane in single combat. The vow might have been taken more solemnly if Ser Tanton had not had one foot in a gravy boat when he made it.\nThe height of folly was reached when a plump fool came capering out in gold-painted tin with a cloth lion\u2019s head, and chased a dwarf around the tables, whacking him over the head with a bladder. Finally King Renly demanded to know why he was beating his brother. \u201cWhy, Your Grace, I\u2019m the Kinslayer,\u201d the fool said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kingslayer, fool of a fool,\u201d Renly said, and the hall rang with laughter.\nLord Rowan beside her did not join the merriment. \u201cThey are all so young,\u201d he said.\nIt was true. The Knight of Flowers could not have reached his second name day when Robert slew Prince Rhaegar on the Trident. Few of the others were very much older. They had been babes during the Sack of King\u2019s Landing, and no more than boys when Balon Greyjoy raised the Iron Islands in rebellion. They are still unblooded, Catelyn thought as she watched Lord Bryce goad Ser Robar into juggling a brace of daggers. It is all a game to them still, a tourney writ large, and all they see is the chance for glory and honor and spoils. They are boys drunk on song and story, and like all boys, they think themselves immortal.\n\u201cWar will make them old,\u201d Catelyn said, \u201cas it did us.\u201d She had been a girl when Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn raised their banners against Aerys Targaryen, a woman by the time the fighting was done. \u201cI pity them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Lord Rowan asked her. \u201cLook at them. They\u2019re young and strong, full of life and laughter. And lust, aye, more lust than they know what to do with. There will be many a bastard bred this night, I promise you. Why pity?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it will not last,\u201d Catelyn answered, sadly. \u201cBecause they are the knights of summer, and winter is coming.\u201d\n\u201cLady Catelyn, you are wrong.\u201d Brienne regarded her with eyes as blue as her armor. \u201cWinter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it\u2019s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.\u201d\nWinter comes for all of us, Catelyn thought. For me, it came when Ned died. It will come for you too, child, and sooner than you like. She did not have the heart to say it.\nThe king saved her. \u201cLady Catelyn,\u201d Renly called down. \u201cI feel the need of some air. Will you walk with me?\u201d\nCatelyn stood at once. \u201cI should be honored.\u201d\nBrienne was on her feet as well. \u201cYour Grace, give me but a moment to don my mail. You should not be without protection.\u201d\nKing Renly smiled. \u201cIf I am not safe in the heart of Lord Caswell\u2019s castle, with my own host around me, one sword will make no matter\u2026 not even your sword, Brienne. Sit and eat. If I have need of you, I\u2019ll send for you.\u201d\nHis words seemed to strike the girl harder than any blow she had taken that afternoon. \u201cAs you will, Your Grace.\u201d Brienne sat, eyes downcast. Renly took Catelyn\u2019s arm and led her from the hall, past a slouching guardsman who straightened so hurriedly that he near dropped his spear. Renly clapped the man on the shoulder and made a jest of it.\n\u201cThis way, my lady.\u201d The king took her through a low door into a stair tower. As they started up, he said, \u201cPerchance, is Ser Barristan Selmy with your son at Riverrun?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, puzzled. \u201cIs he no longer with Joffrey? He was the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\u201d\nRenly shook his head. \u201cThe Lannisters told him he was too old and gave his cloak to the Hound. I\u2019m told he left King\u2019s Landing vowing to take up service with the true king. That cloak Brienne claimed today was the one I was keeping for Selmy, in hopes that he might offer me his sword. When he did not turn up at Highgarden, I thought perhaps he had gone to Riverrun instead.\u201d\n\u201cWe have not seen him.\u201d\n\u201cHe was old, yes, but a good man still. I hope he has not come to harm. The Lannisters are great fools.\u201d They climbed a few more steps. \u201cOn the night of Robert\u2019s death, I offered your husband a hundred swords and urged him to take Joffrey into his power. Had he listened, he would be regent today, and there would have been no need for me to claim the throne.\u201d\n\u201cNed refused you.\u201d She did not have to be told.\n\u201cHe had sworn to protect Robert\u2019s children,\u201d Renly said. \u201cI lacked the strength to act alone, so when Lord Eddard turned me away, I had no choice but to flee. Had I stayed, I knew the queen would see to it that I did not long outlive my brother.\u201d\nHad you stayed, and lent your support to Ned, he might still be alive, Catelyn thought bitterly.\n\u201cI liked your husband well enough, my lady. He was a loyal friend to Robert, I know\u2026 but he would not listen and he would not bend. Here, I wish to show you something.\u201d They had reached the top of the stairwell. Renly pushed open a wooden door, and they stepped out onto the roof.\nLord Caswell\u2019s keep was scarcely tall enough to call a tower, but the country was low and flat and Catelyn could see for leagues in all directions. Wherever she looked, she saw fires. They covered the earth like fallen stars, and like the stars there was no end to them. \u201cCount them if you like, my lady,\u201d Renly said quietly. \u201cYou will still be counting when dawn breaks in the east. How many fires burn around Riverrun tonight, I wonder?\u201d\nCatelyn could hear faint music drifting from the Great Hall, seeping out into the night. She dare not count the stars.\n\u201cI\u2019m told your son crossed the Neck with twenty thousand swords at his back,\u201d Renly went on. \u201cNow that the lords of the Trident are with him, perhaps he commands forty thousand.\u201d\nNo, she thought, not near so many, we have lost men in battle, and others to the harvest.\n\u201cI have twice that number here,\u201d Renly said, \u201cand this is only part of my strength. Mace Tyrell remains at Highgarden with another ten thousand, I have a strong garrison holding Storm\u2019s End, and soon enough the Dornishmen will join me with all their power. And never forget my brother Stannis, who holds Dragonstone and commands the lords of the narrow sea.\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem that you are the one who has forgotten Stannis,\u201d Catelyn said, more sharply than she\u2019d intended.\n\u201cHis claim, you mean?\u201d Renly laughed. \u201cLet us be blunt, my lady. Stannis would make an appalling king. Nor is he like to become one. Men respect Stannis, even fear him, but precious few have ever loved him.\u201d\n\u201cHe is still your elder brother. If either of you can be said to have a right to the Iron Throne, it must be Lord Stannis.\u201d\nRenly shrugged. \u201cTell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron Throne?\u201d He did not wait for an answer. \u201cOh, there was talk of the blood ties between Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder daughters. No one but the maesters care about any of it. Robert won the throne with his warhammer.\u201d He swept a hand across the campfires that burned from horizon to horizon. \u201cWell, there is my claim, as good as Robert\u2019s ever was. If your son supports me as his father supported Robert, he\u2019ll not find me ungenerous. I will gladly confirm him in all his lands, titles, and honors. He can rule in Winterfell as he pleases. He can even go on calling himself King in the North if he likes, so long as he bends the knee and does me homage as his overlord. King is only a word, but fealty, loyalty, service\u2026 those I must have.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he will not give them to you, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cI mean to be king, my lady, and not of a broken kingdom. I cannot say it plainer than that. Three hundred years ago, a Stark king knelt to Aegon the Dragon, when he saw he could not hope to prevail. That was wisdom. Your son must be wise as well. Once he joins me, this war is good as done. We\u2014\u201d Renly broke off suddenly, distracted. \u201cWhat\u2019s this now?\u201d\nThe rattle of chains heralded the raising of the portcullis. Down in the yard below, a rider in a winged helm urged his well-lathered horse under the spikes. \u201cSummon the king!\u201d he called.\nRenly vaulted up into a crenel. \u201cI\u2019m here, ser.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d The rider spurred his mount closer. \u201cI came swift as I could. From Storm\u2019s End. We are besieged, Your Grace, Ser Cortnay defies them, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 that\u2019s not possible. I would have been told if Lord Tywin left Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cThese are no Lannisters, my liege. It\u2019s Lord Stannis at your gates. King Stannis, he calls himself now.\u201d",

      "content": "Jon\nA blowing rain lashed at Jon\u2019s face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream. Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug, muttering curses on the weather. His raven sat on his shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself. A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds. The haunted forest, Jon thought ruefully. The drowned forest, more like it.\nHe hoped Sam was holding up, back down the column. He was not a good rider even in fair weather, and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous, all soft mud and hidden rocks. When the wind blew, it drove the water right into their eyes. The Wall would be flowing off to the south, the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and rivers. Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room, drinking cups of mulled wine before their supper. Jon envied them. His wet wool clung to him sodden and itching, his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword, and he was sick of salt cod, salt beef, and hard cheese.\nUp ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note, half drowned beneath the constant patter of the rain. \u201cBuckwell\u2019s horn,\u201d the Old Bear announced. \u201cThe gods are good; Craster\u2019s still there.\u201d His raven gave a single flap of his big wings, croaked \u201cCorn,\u201d and ruffled his feathers up again.\nJon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and his keep. Now he would see it with his own eyes. After seven empty villages, they had all come to dread finding Craster\u2019s as dead and desolate as the rest, but it seemed they would be spared that. Perhaps the Old Bear will finally get some answers, he thought. Anyway, we\u2019ll be out of the rain.\nThoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch, despite his unsavory reputation. \u201cThe man\u2019s half-mad, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d he\u2019d told the Old Bear, \u201cbut you\u2019d be the same if you\u2019d spent your life in this cursed wood. Even so, he\u2019s never turned a ranger away from his fire, nor does he love Mance Rayder. He\u2019ll give us good counsel.\u201d\nSo long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes, I\u2019ll be happy. Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. \u201cAnd worse,\u201d the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. \u201cThere\u2019s a cold smell to that one, there is.\u201d\n\u201cJon,\u201d Lord Mormont commanded, \u201cride back along the column and spread the word. And remind the officers that I want no trouble about Craster\u2019s wives. The men are to mind their hands and speak to these women as little as need be.\u201d\n\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d Jon turned his horse back the way they\u2019d come. It was pleasant to have the rain out of his face, if only for a little while. Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping. The march was strung out through half a mile of woods.\nIn the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat. He was riding one dray horse and leading the others. The drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering. \u201cYou put a fox in with them?\u201d Jon called out.\nWater ran off the brim of Sam\u2019s hat as he lifted his head. \u201cOh, hullo, Jon. No, they just hate the rain, the same as us.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you faring, Sam?\u201d\n\u201cWetly.\u201d The fat boy managed a smile. \u201cNothing has killed me yet, though.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Craster\u2019s Keep is just ahead. If the gods are good, he\u2019ll let us sleep by his fire.\u201d\nSam looked dubious. \u201cDolorous Edd says Craster\u2019s a terrible savage. He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. And Dywen told Grenn he\u2019s got black blood in his veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger, so he\u2019s a bas\u2026\u201d Suddenly he realized what he was about to say.\n\u201cA bastard,\u201d Jon said with a laugh. \u201cYou can say it, Sam. I\u2019ve heard the word before.\u201d He put the spurs to his surefooted little garron. \u201cI need to hunt down Ser Ottyn. Be careful around Craster\u2019s women.\u201d As if Samwell Tarly needed warning on that score. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, after we\u2019ve made camp.\u201d\nJon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers, plodding along with the rear guard. A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle Black, and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully. \u201cWelcome tidings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wet has soaked my bones, and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores.\u201d\nOn his way back, Jon swung wide of the column\u2019s line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood. The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the wet green wild, and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock. It was midafternoon, yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk. Jon wove a path between rocks and puddles, past great oaks, grey-green sentinels, and black-barked ironwoods. In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment\u2019s respite from the drumming of the rain against his head. As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush. \u201cGhost,\u201d he called out. \u201cGhost, to me.\u201d\nBut it was Dywen who emerged from the greenery, forking a shaggy grey garron with Grenn ahorse beside him. The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column, to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies, and even there he took no chances, sending the men out in pairs.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s you, Lord Snow.\u201d Dywen smiled an oaken smile; his teeth were carved of wood, and fit badly. \u201cThought me and the boy had us one o\u2019 them Others to deal with. Lose your wolf?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s off hunting.\u201d Ghost did not like to travel with the column, but he would not be far. When they made camp for the night, he\u2019d find his way to Jon at the Lord Commander\u2019s tent.\n\u201cFishing, I\u2019d call it, in this wet,\u201d Dywen said.\n\u201cMy mother always said rain was good for growing crops,\u201d Grenn put in hopefully.\n\u201cAye, a good crop of mildew,\u201d Dywen said. \u201cThe best thing about a rain like this, it saves a man from taking baths.\u201d He made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth.\n\u201cBuckwell\u2019s found Craster,\u201d Jon told them.\n\u201cHad he lost him?\u201d Dywen chuckled. \u201cSee that you young bucks don\u2019t go nosing about Craster\u2019s wives, you hear?\u201d\nJon smiled. \u201cWant them all for yourself, Dywen?\u201d\nDywen clacked his teeth some more. \u201cMight be I do. Craster\u2019s got ten fingers and one cock, so he don\u2019t count but to eleven. He\u2019d never miss a couple.\u201d\n\u201cHow many wives does he have, truly?\u201d Grenn asked.\n\u201cMore\u2019n you ever will, brother. Well, it\u2019s not so hard when you breed your own. There\u2019s your beast, Snow.\u201d\nGhost was trotting along beside Jon\u2019s horse with tail held high, his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain. He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared. Grenn\u2019s mount shied at the scent of him; even now, after more than a year, the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf. \u201cWith me, Ghost.\u201d Jon spurred off to Craster\u2019s Keep.\nHe had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but he had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep. What they found instead was a midden heap, a pigsty, an empty sheepfold, and a windowless daub-and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name. It was long and low, chinked together from logs and roofed with sod. The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill, surrounded by an earthen dike. Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains.\nOn the southwest, he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles: a bear to one side, a ram to the other. Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull, Jon noted as he joined the line riding past. Within, Jarmen Buckwell\u2019s scouts and men from Thoren Smallwood\u2019s van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents. A host of piglets rooted about three huge sows in the sty. Nearby, a small girl pulled carrots from a garden, naked in the rain, while two women tied a pig for slaughter. The animal\u2019s squeals were high and horrible, almost human in their distress. Chett\u2019s hounds barked wildly in answer, snarling and snapping despite his curses, with a pair of Craster\u2019s dogs barking back. When they saw Ghost, some of the dogs broke off and ran, while others began to bay and growl. The direwolf ignored them, as did Jon.\nWell, thirty of us will be warm and dry, Jon thought once he\u2019d gotten a good look at the hall. Perhaps as many as fifty. The place was much too small to sleep two hundred men, so most would need to remain outside. And where to put them? The rain had turned half the compound yard to ankle-deep puddles and the rest to sucking mud. Another dismal night was in prospect.\nThe Lord Commander had entrusted his mount to Dolorous Edd. He was cleaning mud out of the horse\u2019s hooves as Jon dismounted. \u201cLord Mormont\u2019s in the hall,\u201d he announced. \u201cHe said for you to join him. Best leave the wolf outside, he looks hungry enough to eat one of Craster\u2019s children. Well, truth be told, I\u2019m hungry enough to eat one of Craster\u2019s children, so long as he was served hot. Go on, I\u2019ll see to your horse. If it\u2019s warm and dry inside, don\u2019t tell me, I wasn\u2019t asked in.\u201d He flicked a glob of wet mud out from under a horseshoe. \u201cDoes this mud look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole hill is made of Craster\u2019s shit?\u201d\nJon smiled. \u201cWell, I hear he\u2019s been here a long time.\u201d\n\u201cYou cheer me not. Go see the Old Bear.\u201d\n\u201cGhost, stay,\u201d he commanded. The door to Craster\u2019s Keep was made of two flaps of deerhide. Jon shoved between them, stooping to pass under the low lintel. Two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him, and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about their boots. The hall stank of soot, dung, and wet dog. The air was heavy with smoke, yet somehow still damp. Rain leaked through the smoke hole in the roof. It was all a single room, with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery ladders.\nJon remembered how he\u2019d felt the day they had left the Wall: nervous as a maiden, but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon. Well, here\u2019s one of the wonders, he told himself, gazing about the squalid, foul-smelling hall. The acrid smoke was making his eyes water. A pity that Pyp and Toad can\u2019t see all they\u2019re missing.\nCraster sat above the fire, the only man to enjoy his own chair. Even Lord Commander Mormont must seat himself on the common bench, with his raven muttering on his shoulder. Jarman Buckwell stood behind, dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather, beside Thoren Smallwood in the late Ser Jaremy\u2019s heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak.\nCraster\u2019s sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast, but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold. He looked to be a powerful man, though well into the winter of his days now, his mane of hair grey going to white. A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look, and one of his ears was missing. So this is a wildling. Jon remembered Old Nan\u2019s tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls. Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup. Perhaps he had not heard the stories.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years,\u201d he was telling Mormont. \u201cAnd if truth be told, I never once missed him.\u201d A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle.\n\u201cHe ought to have passed here last year,\u201d said Thoren Smallwood. A dog came sniffing round his leg. He kicked it and sent it off yipping.\nLord Mormont said, \u201cBen was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, who\u2019d vanished with Gared and young Will.\u201d\n\u201cAye, those three I recall. The lordling no older than one of these pups. Too proud to sleep under my roof, him in his sable cloak and black steel. My wives give him big cow eyes all the same.\u201d He turned his squint on the nearest of the women. \u201cGared says they were chasing raiders. I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch \u2019em. Gared wasn\u2019t half-bad, for a crow. Had less ears than me, that one. The \u2019bite took \u2019em, same as mine.\u201d Craster laughed. \u201cNow I hear he got no head neither. The \u2019bite do that too?\u201d\nJon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow, and the way Theon Greyjoy had kicked the dead man\u2019s head. The man was a deserter. On the way back to Winterfell, Jon and Robb had raced, and found six direwolf pups in the snow. A thousand years ago.\n\u201cWhen Ser Waymar left you, where was he bound?\u201d\nCraster gave a shrug. \u201cHappens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of crows.\u201d He drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside. \u201cHad no good southron wine up here for a bear\u2019s night. I could use me some wine, and a new axe. Mine\u2019s lost its bite, can\u2019t have that, I got me women to protect.\u201d He gazed around at his scurrying wives.\n\u201cYou are few here, and isolated,\u201d Mormont said. \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll detail some men to escort you south to the Wall.\u201d\nThe raven seemed to like the notion. \u201cWall,\u201d it screamed, spreading black wings like a high collar behind Mormont\u2019s head.\nTheir host gave a nasty smile, showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth. \u201cAnd what would we do there, serve you at supper? We\u2019re free folk here. Craster serves no man.\u201d\n\u201cThese are bad times to dwell alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.\u201d\n\u201cLet them rise. My roots are sunk deep.\u201d Craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist. \u201cTell him, wife. Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are.\u201d\nThe woman licked at thin lips. \u201cThis is our place. Craster keeps us safe. Better to die free than live a slave.\u201d\n\u201cSlave,\u201d muttered the raven.\nMormont leaned forward. \u201cEvery village we have passed has been abandoned. Yours are the first living faces we\u2019ve seen since we left the Wall. The people are gone\u2026 whether dead, fled, or taken, I could not say. The animals as well. Nothing is left. And earlier, we found the bodies of two of Ben Stark\u2019s rangers only a few leagues from the Wall. They were pale and cold, with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed. Yet when we took them back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me, which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived, but there was no human mercy left in them.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s mouth hung open, a wet pink cave, but Craster only gave a snort. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no such troubles here\u2026 and I\u2019ll thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof. I\u2019m a godly man, and the gods keep me safe. If wights come walking, I\u2019ll know how to send them back to their graves. Though I could use me a sharp new axe.\u201d He sent his wife scurrying with a slap on her leg and a shout of \u201cMore beer, and be quick about it.\u201d\n\u201cNo trouble from the dead,\u201d Jarmen Buckwell said, \u201cbut what of the living, my lord? What of your king?\u201d\n\u201cKing!\u201d cried Mormont\u2019s raven. \u201cKing, king, king.\u201d\n\u201cThat Mance Rayder?\u201d Craster spit into the fire. \u201cKing-beyond-the-Wall. What do free folk want with kings?\u201d He turned his squint on Mormont. \u201cThere\u2019s much I could tell you o\u2019 Rayder and his doings, if I had a mind. This o\u2019 the empty villages, that\u2019s his work. You would have found this hall abandoned as well, if I were a man to scrape to such. He sends a rider, tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet. I sent the man back, but kept his tongue. It\u2019s nailed to that wall there.\u201d He pointed. \u201cMight be that I could tell you where to seek Mance Rayder. If I had a mind.\u201d The brown smile again. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have time enough for that. You\u2019ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, belike, and eat me out of pigs.\u201d\n\u201cA roof would be most welcome, my lord,\u201d Mormont said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had hard riding, and too much wet.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll guest here for a night. No longer, I\u2019m not that fond o\u2019 crows. The loft\u2019s for me and mine, but you\u2019ll have all the floor you like. I\u2019ve meat and beer for twenty, no more. The rest o\u2019 your black crows can peck after their own corn.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve packed in our own supplies, my lord,\u201d said the Old Bear. \u201cWe should be pleased to share our food and wine.\u201d\nCraster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand. \u201cI\u2019ll taste your wine, Lord Crow, that I will. One more thing. Any man lays a hand on my wives, he loses the hand.\u201d\n\u201cYour roof, your rule,\u201d said Thoren Smallwood, and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly, though he looked none too pleased.\n\u201cThat\u2019s settled, then.\u201d Craster grudged them a grunt. \u201cD\u2019ya have a man can draw a map?\u201d\n\u201cSam Tarly can.\u201d Jon pushed forward. \u201cSam loves maps.\u201d\nMormont beckoned him closer. \u201cSend him here after he\u2019s eaten. Have him bring quill and parchment. And find Tollett as well. Tell him to bring my axe. A guest gift for our host.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s this one now?\u201d Craster said before Jon could go. \u201cHe has the look of a Stark.\u201d\n\u201cMy steward and squire, Jon Snow.\u201d\n\u201cA bastard, is it?\u201d Craster looked Jon up and down. \u201cMan wants to bed a woman, seems like he ought to take her to wife. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d He shooed Jon off with a wave. \u201cWell, run and do your service, bastard, and see that axe is good and sharp now, I\u2019ve no use for dull steel.\u201d\nJon Snow bowed stiffly and took his leave. Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as he was leaving, and they almost collided at the deerhide door. Outside, the rain seemed to have slackened. Tents had gone up all over the compound. Jon could see the tops of others under the trees.\nDolorous Edd was feeding the horses. \u201cGive the wildling an axe, why not?\u201d He pointed out Mormont\u2019s weapon, a short-hafted battle-axe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black steel blade. \u201cHe\u2019ll give it back, I vow. Buried in the Old Bear\u2019s skull, like as not. Why not give him all our axes, and our swords as well? I mislike the way they clank and rattle as we ride. We\u2019d travel faster without them, straight to hell\u2019s door. Does it rain in hell, I wonder? Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead.\u201d\nJon smiled. \u201cHe wants an axe. And wine as well.\u201d\n\u201cSee, the Old Bear\u2019s clever. If we get the wildling well and truly drunk, perhaps he\u2019ll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe. I have two ears but only one head.\u201d\n\u201cSmallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know the difference between a wildling who\u2019s a friend to the Watch and one who\u2019s not?\u201d asked the dour squire. \u201cOur enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves. Our friends bury us in secret graves. I wonder how long that bear\u2019s been nailed up on that gate, and what Craster had there before we came hallooing?\u201d Edd looked at the axe doubtfully, the rain running down his long face. \u201cIs it dry in there?\u201d\n\u201cDrier than out here.\u201d\n\u201cIf I lurk about after, not too close to the fire, belike they\u2019ll take no note of me till morn. The ones under his roof will be the first he murders, but at least we\u2019ll die dry.\u201d\nJon had to laugh. \u201cCraster\u2019s one man. We\u2019re two hundred. I doubt he\u2019ll murder anyone.\u201d\n\u201cYou cheer me,\u201d said Edd, sounding utterly morose. \u201cAnd besides, there\u2019s much to be said for a good sharp axe. I\u2019d hate to be murdered with a maul. I saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once. Scarce split the skin at all, but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd, only purply-red. A comely man, but he died ugly. It\u2019s good that we\u2019re not giving them mauls.\u201d Edd walked away shaking his head, his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him.\nJon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper. He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear. \u201cWolf!\u201d He sprinted around the hall toward the cry, the earth sucking at his boots. One of Craster\u2019s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep. \u201cKeep away,\u201d she was shouting at Ghost. \u201cYou keep away!\u201d The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him. \u201cGet it away, m\u2019lord,\u201d she pleaded when she saw him.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d He knew at once what had happened; a wooden hutch, its slats shattered, lay on its side in the wet grass. \u201cHe must have been hungry. We haven\u2019t seen much game.\u201d Jon whistled. The direwolf bolted down the rabbit, crunching the small bones between his teeth, and padded over to him.\nThe woman regarded them with nervous eyes. She was younger than he\u2019d thought at first. A girl of fifteen or sixteen years, he judged, dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain, her bare feet muddy to the ankles. The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy. \u201cAre you one of Craster\u2019s daughters?\u201d he asked.\nShe put a hand over her belly. \u201cWife now.\u201d Edging away from the wolf, she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch. \u201cI was going to breed them rabbits. There\u2019s no sheep left.\u201d\n\u201cThe Watch will make good for them.\u201d Jon had no coin of his own, or he would have offered it to her\u2026 though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the Wall. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow.\u201d\nShe wiped her hands on her skirt. \u201cM\u2019lord\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no lord.\u201d\nBut others had come crowding round, drawn by the woman\u2019s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe him, girl,\u201d called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a cur. \u201cThat\u2019s Lord Snow himself.\u201d\n\u201cBastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,\u201d mocked Chett, who\u2019d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about.\n\u201cThat wolf\u2019s looking at you hungry, girl,\u201d Lark said. \u201cMight be it fancies that tender bit in your belly.\u201d\nJon was not amused. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring her.\u201d\n\u201cWarning her, more like.\u201d Chett\u2019s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not to talk to you,\u201d the girl remembered suddenly.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jon said, too late. She bolted, ran.\nLark made a grab for the second rabbit, but Ghost was quicker. When he bared his teeth, the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt. The others laughed. The direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to Jon.\n\u201cThere was no call to scare the girl,\u201d he told them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hear no scolds from you, bastard.\u201d Chett blamed Jon for the loss of his comfortable position with Maester Aemon, and not without justice. If he had not gone to Aemon about Sam Tarly, Chett would still be tending an old blind man instead of a pack of ill-tempered hunting hounds. \u201cYou may be the Lord Commander\u2019s pet, but you\u2019re not the Lord Commander\u2026 and you wouldn\u2019t talk so bloody bold without that monster of yours always about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll not fight a brother while we\u2019re beyond the Wall,\u201d Jon answered, his voice cooler than he felt.\nLark got to one knee. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you, Chett. On the Sisters, we have a name for them like him.\u201d\n\u201cI know all the names. Save your breath.\u201d He walked away, Ghost at his side. The rain had dwindled to a thin drizzle by the time he reached the gate. Dusk would be on them soon, followed by another wet dark dismal night. The clouds would hide moon and stars and Mormont\u2019s Torch, turning the woods black as pitch. Every piss would be an adventure, if not quite of the sort Jon Snow had once envisioned.\nOut under the trees, some rangers had found enough duff and dry wood to start a fire beneath a slanting ridge of slate. Others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching their cloaks over low branches. Giant had crammed himself inside the hollow of a dead oak. \u201cHow d\u2019ye like my castle, Lord Snow?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks snug. You know where Sam is?\u201d\n\u201cKeep on the way you were. If you come on Ser Ottyn\u2019s pavilion, you\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d Giant smiled. \u201cUnless Sam\u2019s found him a tree too. What a tree that would be.\u201d\nIt was Ghost who found Sam in the end. The direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a crossbow. Under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain, Sam was feeding the ravens. His boots squished when he moved. \u201cMy feet are soaked through,\u201d he admitted miserably. \u201cWhen I climbed off my horse, I stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees.\u201d\n\u201cTake off your boots and dry your stockings. I\u2019ll find some dry wood. If the ground\u2019s not wet under the rock, we might be able to get a fire burning.\u201d Jon showed Sam the rabbit. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll feast.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t you be attending Lord Mormont in the hall?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but you will. The Old Bear wants you to map for him. Craster says he\u2019ll find Mance Rayder for us.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sam did not look anxious to meet Craster, even if it meant a warm fire.\n\u201cHe said eat first, though. Dry your feet.\u201d Jon went to gather fuel, digging down under deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until he found likely kindling. Even then, it seemed to take forever for a spark to catch. He hung his cloak from the rock to keep the rain off his smoky little fire, making them a small snug alcove.\nAs he knelt to skin the rabbit, Sam pulled off his boots. \u201cI think there\u2019s moss growing between my toes,\u201d he declared mournfully, wriggling the toes in question. \u201cThe rabbit will taste good. I don\u2019t even mind about the blood and all.\u201d He looked away. \u201cWell, only a little\u2026\u201d\nJon spitted the carcass, banked the fire with a pair of rocks, and balanced their meal atop them. The rabbit had been a scrawny thing, but as it cooked it smelled like a king\u2019s feast. Other rangers gave them envious looks. Even Ghost looked up hungrily, flames shining in his red eyes as he sniffed. \u201cYou had yours before,\u201d Jon reminded him.\n\u201cIs Craster as savage as the rangers say?\u201d Sam asked. The rabbit was a shade underdone, but tasted wonderful. \u201cWhat\u2019s his castle like?\u201d\n\u201cA midden heap with a roof and a firepit.\u201d Jon told Sam what he had seen and heard in Craster\u2019s Keep.\nBy the time the telling was done, it was dark outside and Sam was licking his fingers. \u201cThat was good, but now I\u2019d like a leg of lamb. A whole leg, just for me, sauced with mint and honey and cloves. Did you see any lambs?\u201d\n\u201cThere was a sheepfold, but no sheep.\u201d\n\u201cHow does he feed all his men?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see any men. Just Craster and his women and a few small girls. I wonder he\u2019s able to hold the place. His defenses were nothing to speak of, only a muddy dike. You had better go up to the hall and draw that map. Can you find the way?\u201d\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t fall in the mud.\u201d Sam struggled back into his boots, collected quill and parchment, and shouldered out into the night, the rain pattering down on his cloak and floppy hat.\nGhost laid his head on his paws and went to sleep by the fire. Jon stretched out beside him, grateful for the warmth. He was cold and wet, but not so cold and wet as he\u2019d been a short time before. Perhaps tonight the Old Bear will learn something that will lead us to Uncle Benjen.\nHe woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he\u2019d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen. He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.\nThe pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen. Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.\nSo there is magic beyond the Wall after all. He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.\n\u201cLord Snow?\u201d he heard. Soft and meek. He turned.\nCrouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. Sam\u2019s cloak, Jon realized at once. Why is she wearing Sam\u2019s cloak? \u201cThe fat one told me I\u2019d find you here, m\u2019lord,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe ate the rabbit, if that\u2019s what you came for.\u201d The admission made him feel absurdly guilty.\n\u201cOld Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits.\u201d Her arms closed over the swell of her belly. \u201cIs it true, m\u2019lord? Are you brother to a king?\u201d\n\u201cA half brother,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. My brother Robb is the King in the North. Why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cThe fat one, that Sam, he said to see you. He give me his cloak, so no one would say I didn\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t Craster be angry with you?\u201d\n\u201cMy father drank overmuch of the Lord Crow\u2019s wine last night. He\u2019ll sleep most of the day.\u201d Her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs. \u201cThey say the king gives justice and protects the weak.\u201d She started to climb off the rock, awkwardly, but the ice had made it slippery and her foot went out from under her. Jon caught her before she could fall, and helped her safely down. The woman knelt on the icy ground. \u201cM\u2019lord, I beg you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t beg me anything. Go back to your hall, you shouldn\u2019t be here. We were commanded not to speak to Craster\u2019s women.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak with me, m\u2019lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d\nAll she asks, he thought. As if that were nothing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll be your wife, if you like. My father, he\u2019s got nineteen now, one less won\u2019t hurt him none.\u201d\n\u201cBlack brothers are sworn never to take wives, don\u2019t you know that? And we\u2019re guests in your father\u2019s hall besides.\u201d\n\u201cNot you,\u201d she said. \u201cI watched. You never ate at his board, nor slept by his fire. He never gave you guest-right, so you\u2019re not bound to him. It\u2019s for the baby I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d\n\u201cGilly, he called me. For the gillyflower.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty.\u201d He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please her. \u201cIs it Craster who frightens you, Gilly?\u201d\n\u201cFor the baby, not for me. If it\u2019s a girl, that\u2019s not so bad, she\u2019ll grow a few years and he\u2019ll marry her. But Nella says it\u2019s to be a boy, and she\u2019s had six and knows these things. He gives the boys to the gods. Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often. That\u2019s why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the sheep\u2019s gone too. Next it will be dogs, till\u2026\u201d She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly.\n\u201cWhat gods?\u201d Jon was remembering that they\u2019d seen no boys in Craster\u2019s Keep, nor men either, save Craster himself.\n\u201cThe cold gods,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ones in the night. The white shadows.\u201d\nAnd suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commander\u2019s Tower again. A severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword, it lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. The dead man rose to his feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face. Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly, yet there was no blood.\n\u201cWhat color are their eyes?\u201d he asked her.\n\u201cBlue. As bright as blue stars, and as cold.\u201d\nShe has seen them, he thought. Craster lied.\n\u201cWill you take me? Just so far as the Wall\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe do not ride for the Wall. We ride north, after Mance Rayder and these Others, these white shadows and their wights. We seek them, Gilly. Your babe would not be safe with us.\u201d\nHer fear was plain on her face. \u201cYou will come back, though. When your warring\u2019s done, you\u2019ll pass this way again.\u201d\n\u201cWe may.\u201d If any of us still live. \u201cThat\u2019s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call the Lord Crow. I\u2019m only his squire. I do not choose the road I ride.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He could hear the defeat in her voice. \u201cSorry to be of trouble, m\u2019lord. I only\u2026 they said the king keeps people safe, and I thought\u2026\u201d Despairing, she ran, Sam\u2019s cloak flapping behind her like great black wings.\nJon watched her go, his joy in the morning\u2019s brittle beauty gone. Damn her, he thought resentfully, and damn Sam twice for sending her to me. What did he think I could do for her? We\u2019re here to fight wildlings, not save them.\nOther men were crawling from their shelters, yawning and stretching. The magic was already faded, icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun. Someone had gotten a fire started; he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and the smoky scent of bacon. Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap. A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell. Afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells.\nGrenn and Dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire. Hake handed Jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in bacon grease. He wolfed it down while listening to Dywen boast of having three of Craster\u2019s women during the night.\n\u201cYou did not,\u201d Grenn said, scowling. \u201cI would have seen.\u201d\nDywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand. \u201cYou? Seen? You\u2019re blind as Maester Aemon. You never even saw that bear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat bear? Was there a bear?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a bear,\u201d declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation. \u201cOne killed my brother when I was young. Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong. And they were good teeth too, better than mine. I\u2019ve had nothing but trouble with my teeth.\u201d\n\u201cDid Sam sleep in the hall last night?\u201d Jon asked him.\n\u201cI\u2019d not call it sleeping. The ground was hard, the rushes ill-smelling, and my brothers snore frightfully. Speak of bears if you will, none ever growled so fierce as Brown Bernarr. I was warm, though. Some dogs crawled atop me during the night. My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it. Or perhaps it was Brown Bernarr. Have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me? It will start again now that I\u2019m back out. Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d best go see to Lord Mormont,\u201d said Jon.\nThe rain might have stopped, but the compound was still a morass of shallow lakes and slippery mud. Black brothers were folding their tents, feeding their horses, and chewing on strips of salt beef. Jarman Buckwell\u2019s scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before setting out. \u201cJon,\u201d Buckwell greeted him from horseback. \u201cKeep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours. We\u2019ll be needing it soon enough.\u201d\nCraster\u2019s hall was dim after daylight. Inside, the night\u2019s torches had burned low, and it was hard to know that the sun had risen. Lord Mormont\u2019s raven was the first to spy him enter. Three lazy flaps of its great black wings, and it perched atop Longclaw\u2019s hilt. \u201cCorn?\u201d It nipped at a strand of Jon\u2019s hair.\n\u201cIgnore that wretched beggar bird, Jon, it\u2019s just had half my bacon.\u201d The Old Bear sat at Craster\u2019s board, breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread, bacon, and sheepgut sausage. Craster\u2019s new axe was on the table, its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight. Its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above, but the women were all up, moving about and serving. \u201cWhat sort of day do we have?\u201d\n\u201cCold, but the rain has stopped.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. See that my horse is saddled and ready. I mean for us to ride within the hour. Have you eaten? Craster serves plain fare, but filling.\u201d\nI will not eat Craster\u2019s food, he decided suddenly. \u201cI broke my fast with the men, my lord.\u201d Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw. The bird hopped back to Mormont\u2019s shoulder, where it promptly shat. \u201cYou might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me,\u201d the Old Bear grumbled. The raven quorked.\nHe found Sam behind the hall, standing with Gilly at the broken rabbit hutch. She was helping him back into his cloak, but when she saw Jon she stole away. Sam gave him a look of wounded reproach. \u201cI thought you would help her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how was I to do that?\u201d Jon said sharply. \u201cTake her with us, wrapped up in your cloak? We were commanded not to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Sam guiltily, \u201cbut she was afraid. I know what it is to be afraid. I told her\u2026\u201d He swallowed.\n\u201cWhat? That we\u2019d take her with us?\u201d\nSam\u2019s fat face blushed a deep red. \u201cOn the way home.\u201d He could not meet Jon\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a baby.\u201d\n\u201cSam, have you taken leave of all your sense? We may not even return this way. And if we do, do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster\u2019s wives?\u201d\n\u201cI thought\u2026 maybe by then I could think of a way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle.\u201d Jon walked away as confused as he was angry. Sam\u2019s heart was a big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times. It was impossible, and dishonorable besides. So why do I feel so ashamed?\nJon took his accustomed position at Mormont\u2019s side as the Night\u2019s Watch streamed out past the skulls on Craster\u2019s gate. They struck off north and west along a crooked game trail. Melting ice dripped down all about them, a slower sort of rain with its own soft music. North of the compound, the brook was in full spate, choked with leaves and bits of wood, but the scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across. The water ran as high as a horse\u2019s belly. Ghost swam, emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping brown. When he shook, spraying mud and water in all directions, Mormont said nothing, but on his shoulder the raven screeched.\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more. \u201cCraster has no sheep. Nor any sons.\u201d\nMormont made no answer.\n\u201cAt Winterfell one of the serving women told us stories,\u201d Jon went on. \u201cShe used to say that there were wildlings who would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.\u201d\n\u201cHearth tales. Does Craster seem less than human to you?\u201d\nIn half a hundred ways. \u201cHe gives his sons to the wood.\u201d\nA long silence. Then: \u201cYes.\u201d And \u201cYes,\u201d the raven muttered, strutting. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d\n\u201cSmallwood told me. Long ago. All the rangers know, though few will talk of it.\u201d\n\u201cDid my uncle know?\u201d\n\u201cAll the rangers,\u201d Mormont repeated. \u201cYou think I ought to stop him. Kill him if need be.\u201d The Old Bear sighed. \u201cWere it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths, I\u2019d gladly send Yoren or Conwys to collect the boys. We could raise them to the black and the Watch would be that much the stronger. But the wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. These boys are Craster\u2019s offerings. His prayers, if you will.\u201d\nHis wives must offer different prayers, Jon thought.\n\u201cHow is it you came to know this?\u201d the Old Bear asked him. \u201cFrom one of Craster\u2019s wives?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Jon confessed. \u201cI would sooner not tell you which. She was frightened and wanted help.\u201d\n\u201cThe wide world is full of people wanting help, Jon. Would that some could find the courage to help themselves. Craster sprawls in his loft even now, stinking of wine and lost to sense. On his board below lies a sharp new axe. Were it me, I\u2019d name it \u2018Answered Prayer\u2019 and make an end.\u201d\nYes. Jon thought of Gilly. She and her sisters. They were nineteen, and Craster was one, but\u2026\n\u201cYet it would be an ill day for us if Craster died. Your uncle could tell you of the times Craster\u2019s Keep made the difference between life and death for our rangers.\u201d\n\u201cMy father\u2026\u201d He hesitated.\n\u201cGo on, Jon. Say what you would say.\u201d\n\u201cMy father once told me that some men are not worth having,\u201d Jon finished. \u201cA bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself.\u201d\n\u201cCraster is his own man. He has sworn us no vows. Nor is he subject to our laws. Your heart is noble, Jon, but learn a lesson here. We cannot set the world to rights. That is not our purpose. The Night\u2019s Watch has other wars to fight.\u201d\nOther wars. Yes. I must remember. \u201cJarman Buckwell said I might have need of my sword soon.\u201d\n\u201cDid he?\u201d Mormont did not seem pleased. \u201cCraster said much and more last night, and confirmed enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on his floor. Mance Rayder is gathering his people together in the Frostfangs. That\u2019s why the villages are empty. It is the same tale that Ser Denys Mallister had from the wildling his men captured in the Gorge, but Craster has added the where, and that makes all the difference.\u201d\n\u201cIs he making a city, or an army?\u201d\n\u201cNow, that is the question. How many wildlings are there? How many men of fighting age? No one knows with certainty. The Frostfangs are cruel, inhospitable, a wilderness of stone and ice. They will not long sustain any great number of people. I can see only one purpose in this gathering. Mance Rayder means to strike south, into the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d\n\u201cWildlings have invaded the realm before.\u201d Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both, back at Winterfell. \u201cRaymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather\u2019s grandfather, and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and long before them came the Horned Lord and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne, and in ancient days Joramun, who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth. Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side\u2026 but the Night\u2019s Watch is only a shadow of what we were, and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides us? The Lord of Winterfell is dead, and his heir has marched his strength south to fight the Lannisters. The wildlings may never again have such a chance as this. I knew Mance Rayder, Jon. He is an oathbreaker, yes\u2026 but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d asked Jon.\n\u201cFind him,\u201d said Mormont. \u201cFight him. Stop him.\u201d\nThree hundred, thought Jon, against the fury of the wild. His fingers opened and closed.",

      "content": "Theon\nShe was undeniably a beauty. But your first is always beautiful, Theon Greyjoy thought.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a pretty grin,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice said behind him. \u201cThe lordling likes the look of her, does he?\u201d\nTheon turned to give her an appraising glance. He liked what he saw. Ironborn, he knew at a glance; lean and longlegged, with black hair cut short, wind-chafed skin, strong sure hands, a dirk at her belt. Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face, but her smile made up for it. He judged her a few years older than he was, but no more than five-and-twenty. She moved as if she were used to a deck beneath her feet.\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s a sweet sight,\u201d he told her, \u201cthough not half so sweet as you.\u201d\n\u201cOho.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019d best be careful. This lordling has a honeyed tongue.\u201d\n\u201cTaste it and see.\u201d\n\u201cIs it that way, then?\u201d she said, eyeing him boldly. There were women on the Iron Islands\u2014not many, but a few\u2014who crewed the longships along with their men, and it was said that salt and sea changed them, gave them a man\u2019s appetites. \u201cHave you been that long at sea, lordling? Or were there no women where you came from?\u201d\n\u201cWomen enough, but none like you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how would you know what I\u2019m like?\u201d\n\u201cMy eyes can see your face. My ears can hear your laughter. And my cock\u2019s gone hard as a mast for you.\u201d\nThe woman stepped close and pressed a hand to the front of his breeches. \u201cWell, you\u2019re no liar,\u201d she said, giving him a squeeze through the cloth. \u201cHow bad does it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cFiercely.\u201d\n\u201cPoor lordling.\u201d She released him and stepped back. \u201cAs it happens, I\u2019m a woman wed, and new with child.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods are good,\u201d Theon said. \u201cNo chance I\u2019d give you a bastard that way.\u201d\n\u201cEven so, my man wouldn\u2019t thank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but you might.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why would that be? I\u2019ve had lords before. They\u2019re made the same as other men.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever had a prince?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWhen you\u2019re wrinkled and grey and your teats hang past your belly, you can tell your children\u2019s children that once you loved a king.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is it love we\u2019re talking now? And here I thought it was just cocks and cunts.\u201d\n\u201cIs it love you fancy?\u201d He\u2019d decided that he liked this wench, whoever she was; her sharp wit was a welcome respite from the damp gloom of Pyke. \u201cShall I name my longship after you, and play you the high harp, and keep you in a tower room in my castle with only jewels to wear, like a princess in a song?\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to name your ship after me,\u201d she said, ignoring all the rest. \u201cIt was me who built her.\u201d\n\u201cSigrin built her. My lord father\u2019s shipwright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Esgred. Ambrode\u2019s daughter, and wife to Sigrin.\u201d\nHe had not known that Ambrode had a daughter, or Sigrin a wife\u2026 but he\u2019d met the younger shipwright only once, and the older one he scarce remembered. \u201cYou\u2019re wasted on Sigrin.\u201d\n\u201cOho. Sigrin told me this sweet ship is wasted on you.\u201d\nTheon bristled. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cPrince Theon of House Greyjoy. Who else? Tell me true, my lord, how well do you love her, this new maid of yours? Sigrin will want to know.\u201d\nThe longship was so new that she still smelled of pitch and resin. His uncle Aeron would bless her on the morrow, but Theon had ridden over from Pyke to get a look at her before she was launched. She was not so large as Lord Balon\u2019s own Great Kraken or his uncle Victarion\u2019s Iron Victory, but she looked swift and sweet, even sitting in her wooden cradle on the strand; lean black hull a hundred feet long, a single tall mast, fifty long oars, deck enough for a hundred men\u2026 and at the prow, the great iron ram in the shape of an arrowhead. \u201cSigrin did me good service,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIs she as fast as she looks?\u201d\n\u201cFaster\u2014for a master that knows how to handle her.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been a few years since I sailed a ship.\u201d And I\u2019ve never captained one, if truth be told. \u201cStill, I\u2019m a Greyjoy, and an ironman. The sea is in my blood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your blood will be in the sea, if you sail the way you talk,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cI would never mistreat such a fair maiden.\u201d\n\u201cFair maiden?\u201d She laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s a sea bitch, this one.\u201d\n\u201cThere, and now you\u2019ve named her. Sea Bitch.\u201d\nThat amused her; he could see the sparkle in her dark eyes. \u201cAnd you said you\u2019d name her after me,\u201d she said in a voice of wounded reproach.\n\u201cI did.\u201d He caught her hand. \u201cHelp me, my lady. In the green lands, they believe a woman with child means good fortune for any man who beds her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would they know about ships in the green lands? Or women, for that matter? Besides, I think you made that up.\u201d\n\u201cIf I confess, will you still love me?\u201d\n\u201cStill? When have I ever loved you?\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut I am trying to repair that lack, my sweet Esgred. The wind is cold. Come aboard my ship and let me warm you. On the morrow my uncle Aeron will pour seawater over her prow and mumble a prayer to the Drowned God, but I\u2019d sooner bless her with the milk of my loins, and yours.\u201d\n\u201cThe Drowned God might not take that kindly.\u201d\n\u201cBugger the Drowned God. If he troubles us, I\u2019ll drown him again. We\u2019re off to war within a fortnight. Would you send me into battle all sleepless with longing?\u201d\n\u201cGladly.\u201d\n\u201cA cruel maid. My ship is well named. If I steer her onto the rocks in my distraction, you\u2019ll have yourself to blame.\u201d\n\u201cDo you plan to steer with this?\u201d Esgred brushed the front of his breeches once more, and smiled as a finger traced the iron outline of his manhood.\n\u201cCome back to Pyke with me,\u201d he said suddenly, thinking, What will Lord Balon say? And why should I care? I am a man grown, if I want to bring a wench to bed it is no one\u2019s business but my own.\n\u201cAnd what would I do in Pyke?\u201d Her hand stayed where it was.\n\u201cMy father will feast his captains tonight.\u201d He had them to feast every night, while he waited for the last stragglers to arrive, but Theon saw no need to tell all that.\n\u201cWould you make me your captain for the night, my lord prince?\u201d She had the wickedest smile he\u2019d ever seen on a woman.\n\u201cI might. If I knew you\u2019d steer me safe into port.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know which end of the oar goes in the sea, and there\u2019s no one better with ropes and knots.\u201d One-handed, she undid the lacing of his breeches, then grinned and stepped lightly away from him. \u201cA pity I\u2019m a woman wed, and new with child.\u201d\nFlustered, Theon laced himself back up. \u201cI need to start back to the castle. if you do not come with me, I may lose my way for grief, and all the islands would be poorer.\u201d\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have that\u2026 but I have no horse, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cYou could take my squire\u2019s mount.\u201d\n\u201cAnd leave your poor squire to walk all the way to Pyke?\u201d\n\u201cShare mine, then.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like that well enough.\u201d The smile again. \u201cNow, would I be behind you, or in front?\u201d\n\u201cYou would be wherever you liked.\u201d\n\u201cI like to be on top.\u201d\nWhere has this wench been all my life? \u201cMy father\u2019s hall is dim and dank. It needs Esgred to make the fires blaze.\u201d\n\u201cThe lordling has a honeyed tongue.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that where we began?\u201d\nShe threw up her hands. \u201cAnd where we end. Esgred is yours, sweet prince. Take me to your castle. Let me see your proud towers rising from the sea.\u201d\n\u201cI left my horse at the inn. Come.\u201d They walked down the strand together, and when Theon took her arm, she did not pull away. He liked the way she walked; there was a boldness to it, part saunter and part sway, that suggested she would be just as bold beneath the blankets.\nLordsport was as crowded as he\u2019d ever seen it, swarming with the crews of the longships that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater. Ironmen did not bend their knees often nor easily, but Theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet as they passed, and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head. They have finally learned who I am, he thought. And past time too.\nLord Goodbrother of Great Wyk had come in the night before with his main strength, near forty longships. His men were everywhere, conspicuous in their striped goat\u2019s hair sashes. It was said about the inn that Otter Gimpknee\u2019s whores were being fucked bowlegged by beardless boys in sashes. The boys were welcome to them so far as Theon was concerned. A poxier den of slatterns he hoped he\u2019d never see. His present companion was more to his taste. That she was wed to his father\u2019s shipwright and pregnant to boot only made her more intriguing.\n\u201cHas my lord prince begun choosing his crew?\u201d Esgred asked as they made their way toward the stable. \u201cHo, Bluetooth,\u201d she shouted to a passing seafarer, a tall man in bearskin vest and raven-winged helm. \u201cHow fares your bride?\u201d\n\u201cFat with child, and talking of twins.\u201d\n\u201cSo soon?\u201d Esgred smiled that wicked smile. \u201cYou got your oar in the water quickly.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and stroked and stroked and stroked,\u201d roared the man.\n\u201cA big man,\u201d Theon observed. \u201cBluetooth, was it? Should I choose him for my Sea Bitch?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you mean to insult him. Bluetooth has a sweet ship of his own.\u201d\n\u201cI have been too long away to know one man from another,\u201d Theon admitted. He\u2019d looked for a few of the friends he\u2019d played with as a boy, but they were gone, dead, or grown into strangers. \u201cMy uncle Victarion has loaned me his own steersman.\u201d\n\u201cRymolf Stormdrunk? A good man, so long as he\u2019s sober.\u201d She saw more faces she knew, and called out to a passing trio, \u201cUller, Qarl. Where\u2019s your brother, Skyte?\u201d\n\u201cThe Drowned God needed a strong oarsman, I fear,\u201d replied the stocky man with the white streak in his beard.\n\u201cWhat he means is, Eldiss drank too much wine and his fat belly burst,\u201d said the pink-cheeked youth beside him.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s dead may never die,\u201d Esgred said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s dead may never die.\u201d\nTheon muttered the words with them. \u201cYou seem well known,\u201d he said to the woman when the men had passed on.\n\u201cEvery man loves the shipwright\u2019s wife. He had better, lest he wants his ship to sink. If you need men to pull your oars, you could do worse than those three.\u201d\n\u201cLordsport has no lack of strong arms.\u201d Theon had given the matter no little thought. It was fighters he wanted, and men who would be loyal to him, not to his lord father or his uncles. He was playing the part of a dutiful young prince for the moment, while he waited for Lord Balon to reveal the fullness of his plans. If it turned out that he did not like those plans or his part in them, however, well\u2026\n\u201cStrength is not enough. A longship\u2019s oars must move as one if you would have her best speed. Choose men who have rowed together before, if you\u2019re wise.\u201d\n\u201cSage counsel. Perhaps you\u2019d help me choose them.\u201d Let her believe I want her wisdom, women fancy that.\n\u201cI may. If you treat me kindly.\u201d\n\u201cHow else?\u201d\nTheon quickened his stride as they neared the Myraham, rocking high and empty by the quay. Her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past, but Lord Balon would not permit it. None of the merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again; his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike.\n\u201cMilord,\u201d a plaintive voice called down from the forecastle of the merchanter. The captain\u2019s daughter leaned over the rail, gazing after him. Her father had forbidden her to come ashore, but whenever Theon came to Lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the deck. \u201cMilord, a moment,\u201d she called after him. \u201cAs it please milord\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDid she?\u201d Esgred asked as Theon hurried her past the cog. \u201cPlease milord?\u201d\nHe saw no sense in being coy with this one. \u201cFor a time. Now she wants to be my salt wife.\u201d\n\u201cOho. Well, she\u2019d profit from some salting, no doubt. Too soft and bland, that one. Or am I wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Soft and bland. Precisely. How had she known?\nHe had told Wex to wait at the inn. The common room was so crowded that Theon had to push his way through the door. Not a seat was to be had at bench nor table. Nor did he see his squire. \u201cWex\u201d, he shouted over the din and clatter. If he\u2019s up with one of those poxy whores, I\u2019ll strip the hide off him, he was thinking when he finally spied the boy, dicing near the hearth\u2026 and winning too, by the look of the pile of coins before him.\n\u201cTime to go,\u201d Theon announced. When the boy paid him no mind, he seized him by the ear and pulled him from the game. Wex grabbed up a fistful of coppers and came along without a word. That was one of the things Theon liked best about him. Most squires have loose tongues, but Wex had been born dumb\u2026 which didn\u2019t seem to keep him from being clever as any twelve-year-old had a right to be. He was a baseborn son of one of Lord Botley\u2019s half brothers. Taking him as squire had been part of the price Theon had paid for his horse.\nWhen Wex saw Esgred, his eyes went round. You\u2019d think he\u2019d never seen a woman before, Theon thought. \u201cEsgred will be riding with me back to Pyke. Saddle the horses, and be quick about it.\u201d\nThe boy had ridden in on a scrawny little garron from Lord Balon\u2019s stable, but Theon\u2019s mount was quite another sort of beast. \u201cWhere did you find that hellhorse?\u201d Esgred asked when she saw him, but from the way she laughed he knew she was impressed.\n\u201cLord Botley bought him in Lannisport a year past, but he proved to be too much horse for him, so Botley was pleased to sell.\u201d The Iron Islands were too sparse and rocky for breeding good horses. Most of the islanders were indifferent riders at best, more comfortable on the deck of a longship than in the saddle. Even the lords rode garrons or shaggy Harlaw ponies, and ox carts were more common than drays. The smallfolk too poor to own either one pulled their own plows through the thin, stony soil.\nBut Theon had spent ten years in Winterfell, and did not intend to go to war without a good mount beneath him. Lord Botley\u2019s misjudgment was his good fortune: a stallion with a temper as black as his hide, larger than a courser if not quite so big as most destriers. As Theon was not quite so big as most knights, that suited him admirably. The animal had fire in his eyes. When he\u2019d met his new owner, he\u2019d pulled back his lips and tried to bite off his face.\n\u201cDoes he have a name?\u201d Esgred asked Theon as he mounted.\n\u201cSmiler.\u201d He gave her a hand, and pulled her up in front of him, where he could put his arms around her as they rode. \u201cI knew a man once who told me that I smiled at the wrong things.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly by the lights of those who smile at nothing.\u201d He thought of his father and his uncle Aeron.\n\u201cAre you smiling now, my lord prince?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Theon reached around her to take the reins. She was almost of a height with him. Her hair could have used a wash and she had a faded pink scar on her pretty neck, but he liked the smell of her, salt and sweat and woman.\nThe ride back to Pyke promised to be a good deal more interesting than the ride down had been.\nWhen they were well beyond Lordsport, Theon put a hand on her breast. Esgred reached up and plucked it away. \u201cI\u2019d keep both hands on the reins, or this black beast of yours is like to fling us both off and kick us to death.\u201d\n\u201cI broke him of that.\u201d Amused, Theon behaved himself for a while, chatting amiably of the weather (grey and overcast, as it had been since he arrived, with frequent rains) and telling her of the men he\u2019d killed in the Whispering Wood. When he reached the part about coming that close to the Kingslayer himself, he slid his hand back up to where it had been. Her breasts were small, but he liked the firmness of them.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, my lord prince.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but I do.\u201d Theon gave her a squeeze.\n\u201cYour squire is watching you.\u201d\n\u201cLet him. He\u2019ll never speak of it, I swear.\u201d\nEsgred pried his fingers off her breast. This time she kept him firmly prisoned. She had strong hands.\n\u201cI like a woman with a good tight grip.\u201d\nShe snorted. \u201cI\u2019d not have thought it, by that wench on the waterfront.\u201d\n\u201cYou must not judge me by her. She was the only woman on the ship.\u201d\n\u201cTell me of your father. Will he welcome me kindly to his castle?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should he? He scarcely welcomed me, his own blood, the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d she asked mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s said that you have uncles, brothers, a sister.\u201d\n\u201cMy brothers are long dead, and my sister\u2026 well, they say Asha\u2019s favorite gown is a chainmail hauberk that hangs down past her knees, with boiled leather smallclothes beneath. Men\u2019s garb won\u2019t make her a man, though. I\u2019ll make a good marriage alliance with her once we\u2019ve won the war, if I can find a man to take her. As I recall, she had a nose like a vulture\u2019s beak, a ripe crop of pimples, and no more chest than a boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou can marry off your sister,\u201d Esgred observed, \u201cbut not your uncles.\u201d\n\u201cMy uncles\u2026\u201d Theon\u2019s claim took precedence over those of his father\u2019s three brothers, but the woman had touched on a sore point nonetheless. in the islands it was scarce unheard of for a strong, ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights, and usually murder him in the bargain. But I am not weak, Theon told himself, and I mean to be stronger yet by the time my father dies. \u201cMy uncles pose no threat to me,\u201d he declared. \u201cAeron is drunk on seawater and sanctity. He lives only for his god\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHis god? Not yours?\u201d\n\u201cMine as well. What is dead can never die.\u201d He smiled thinly. \u201cIf I make pious noises as required, Damphair will give me no trouble. And my uncle Victarion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLord Captain of the Iron Fleet, and a fearsome warrior. I have heard them sing of him in the alehouses.\u201d\n\u201cDuring my lord father\u2019s rebellion, he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and burned the Lannister fleet where it lay at anchor,\u201d Theon recalled. \u201cThe plan was Euron\u2019s, though. Victarion is like some great grey bullock, strong and tireless and dutiful, but not like to win any races. No doubt, he\u2019ll serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father. He has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal.\u201d\n\u201cEuron Croweye has no lack of cunning, though. I\u2019ve heard men say terrible things of that one.\u201d\nTheon shifted his seat. \u201cMy uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two years. He may be dead.\u201d If so, it might be for the best. Lord Balon\u2019s eldest brother had never given up the Old Way, even for a day. His Silence, with its black sails and dark red hull, was infamous in every port from Ibben to Asshai, it was said.\n\u201cHe may be dead,\u201d Esgred agreed, \u201cand if he lives, why, he has spent so long at sea, he\u2019d be half a stranger here. The ironborn would never seat a stranger in the Seastone Chair.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Theon replied, before it occurred to him that some would call him a stranger as well. The thought made him frown. Ten years is a long while, but I am back now, and my father is far from dead. I have time to prove myself.\nHe considered fondling Esgred\u2019s breast again, but she would probably only take his hand away, and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat. Time enough for such play at the castle, in the privacy of his chambers. \u201cI will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke, and see that you have an honored place at the feast,\u201d he said. \u201cI must sit on the dais, at my father\u2019s right hand, but I will come down and join you when he leaves the hall. He seldom lingers long. He has no belly for drink these days.\u201d\n\u201cA grievous thing when a great man grows old.\u201d\n\u201cLord Balon is but the father of a great man.\u201d\n\u201cA modest lordling.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him.\u201d He kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck.\n\u201cWhat shall I wear to this great feast?\u201d She reached back and pushed his face away.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Helya to garb you. One of my lady mother\u2019s gowns might do. She is off on Harlaw, and not expected to return.\u201d\n\u201cThe cold winds have worn her away, I hear. Will you not go see her? Harlaw is only a day\u2019s sail, and surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son.\u201d\n\u201cWould that I could. I am kept too busy here. My father relies on me, now that I am returned. Come peace, perhaps\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour coming might bring her peace.\u201d\n\u201cNow you sound a woman,\u201d Theon complained.\n\u201cI confess, I am\u2026 and new with child.\u201d\nSomehow that thought excited him. \u201cSo you say, but your body shows no signs of it. How shall it be proven? Before I believe you, I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe, and taste your mother\u2019s milk.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what will my husband say to this? Your father\u2019s own sworn man and servant?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll give him so many ships to build, he\u2019ll never know you\u2019ve left him.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a cruel lordling who\u2019s seized me. If I promise you that one day you may watch my babe get suck, will you tell me more of your war, Theon of House Greyjoy? There are miles and mountains still ahead of us, and I would hear of this wolf king you served, and the golden lions he fights.\u201d\nEver anxious to please her, Theon obliged. The rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he filled her pretty head with tales of Winterfell and war. Some of the things he said astonished him. She is easy to talk to, gods praise her, he reflected. I feel as though I\u2019ve known her for years. If the wench\u2019s pillow play is half the equal of her wit, I\u2019ll need to keep her\u2026 He thought of Sigrin the Shipwright, a thick-bodied, thick-witted man, flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow, and shook his head. A waste. A most tragic waste.\nIt seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before them.\nThe gates were open. Theon put his heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot. The hounds were barking wildly as he helped Esgred dismount. Several came bounding up, tails wagging. They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over, leaping all around her, yapping and licking. \u201cOff,\u201d Theon shouted, aiming an ineffectual kick at one big brown bitch, but Esgred was laughing and wrestling with them.\nA stableman came pounding up after the dogs. \u201cTake the horse,\u201d Theon commanded him, \u201cand get these damn dogs away\u2014\u201d\nThe lout paid him no mind. His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and he said, \u201cLady Asha. You\u2019re back.\u201d\n\u201cLast night,\u201d she said. \u201cI sailed from Great Wyk with Lord Goodbrother, and spent the night at the inn. My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from Lordsport.\u201d She kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at Theon.\nAll he could do was stand and gape at her. Asha. No. She cannot be Asha. He realized suddenly that there were two Ashas in his head. One was the little girl he had known. The other, more vaguely imagined, looked something like her mother. Neither looked a bit like this\u2026 this\u2026 this\u2026\n\u201cThe pimples went when the breasts came,\u201d she explained while she tussled with a dog, \u201cbut I kept the vulture\u2019s beak.\u201d\nTheon found his voice. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nAsha let go of the hound and straightened. \u201cI wanted to see who you were first. And I did.\u201d She gave him a mocking half bow. \u201cAnd now, little brother, pray excuse me. I need to bathe and dress for the feast. I wonder if I still have that chainmail gown I like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes?\u201d She gave him that evil grin, and crossed the bridge with that walk he\u2019d liked so well, half saunter and half sway.\nWhen Theon turned away, Wex was smirking at him. He gave the boy a clout on the ear. \u201cThat\u2019s for enjoying this so much.\u201d And another, harder. \u201cAnd that\u2019s for not warning me. Next time, grow a tongue.\u201d\nHis own chambers in the Guest Keep had never seemed so chilly, though the thralls had left a brazier burning. Theon kicked his boots off, let his cloak fall to the floor, and poured himself a cup of wine, remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples. She unlaced my breeches, he thought, outraged, and she said\u2026 oh, gods, and I said\u2026 He groaned. He could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself.\nNo, he thought then. She was the one who made me a fool. The evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of it. And the way she kept reaching for my cock\u2026\nHe took his cup and went to the window seat, where he sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over Pyke. I have no place here, he thought, and Asha is the reason, may the Others take her! The water below turned from green to grey to black. By then he could hear distant music, and he knew it was time to change for the feast.\nTheon chose plain boots and plainer clothes, somber shades of black and grey to fit his mood. No ornament; he had nothing bought with iron. I might have taken something off that wildling I killed to save Bran Stark, but he had nothing worth the taking. That\u2019s my cursed luck, I kill the poor.\nThe long smoky hall was crowded with his father\u2019s lords and captains when Theon entered, near four hundred of them. Dagmer Cleftjaw had not yet returned from Old Wyk with the Stonehouses and Drumms, but all the rest were there\u2014Harlaws from Harlaw, Blacktydes from Blacktyde, Sparrs, Merlyns, and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk, Saltcliffes and Sunderlies from Saltcliffe, and Botleys and Wynches from the other side of Pyke. The thralls were pouring ale, and there was music, fiddles and skins and drums. Three burly men were doing the finger dance, spinning short-hafted axes at each other. The trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step. It was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one\u2026 or two, or five.\nNeither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of Theon Greyjoy as he strode to the dais. Lord Balon occupied the Seastone Chair, carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone. Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when they came to the Iron Islands. To the left of the high seat were Theon\u2019s uncles. Asha was ensconced at his right hand, in the place of honor. \u201cYou come late, Theon,\u201d Lord Balon observed.\n\u201cI ask your pardon.\u201d Theon took the empty seat beside Asha. Leaning close, he hissed in her ear, \u201cYou\u2019re in my place.\u201d\nShe turned to him with innocent eyes. \u201cBrother, surely you are mistaken. Your place is at Winterfell.\u201d Her smile cut. \u201cAnd where are all your pretty clothes? I heard you fancied silk and velvet against your skin.\u201d She was in soft green wool herself, simply cut, the fabric clinging to the slender lines of her body.\n\u201cYour hauberk must have rusted away, sister,\u201d he threw back. \u201cA great pity. I\u2019d like to see you all in iron.\u201d\nAsha only laughed. \u201cYou may yet, little brother\u2026 if you think your Sea Bitch can keep up with my Black Wind.\u201d One of their father\u2019s thralls came near, bearing a flagon of wine. \u201cAre you drinking ale or wine tonight, Theon?\u201d She leaned over close. \u201cOr is it still a taste of my mother\u2019s milk you thirst for?\u201d\nHe flushed. \u201cWine,\u201d he told the thrall. Asha turned away and banged on the table, shouting for ale.\nTheon hacked a loaf of bread in half, hollowed out a trencher, and summoned a cook to fill it with fish stew. The smell of the thick cream made him a little ill, but he forced himself to eat some. He\u2019d drunk enough wine to float him through two meals. If I retch, it will be on her. \u201cDoes Father know that you\u2019ve married his shipwright?\u201d he asked his sister.\n\u201cNo more than Sigrin does.\u201d She gave a shrug. \u201cEsgred was the first ship he built. He named her after his mother. I would be hard-pressed to say which he loves best.\u201d\n\u201cEvery word you spoke to me was a lie.\u201d\n\u201cNot every word. Remember when I told you I like to be on top?\u201d Asha grinned.\nThat only made him angrier. \u201cAll that about being a woman wed, and new with child\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, that part was true enough.\u201d Asha leapt to her feet. \u201cRolfe, here,\u201d she shouted down at one of the finger dancers, holding up a hand. He saw her, spun, and suddenly an axe came flying from his hand, the blade gleaming as it tumbled end over end through the torchlight. Theon had time for a choked gasp before Asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed it down into the table, splitting his trencher in two and splattering his mantle with drippings. \u201cThere\u2019s my lord husband.\u201d His sister reached down inside her gown and drew a dirk from between her breasts. \u201cAnd here\u2019s my sweet suckling babe.\u201d\nHe could not imagine how he looked at that moment, but suddenly Theon Greyjoy realized that the Great Hall was ringing with laughter, all of it at him. Even his father was smiling, gods be damned, and his uncle Victarion chuckled aloud. The best response he could summon was a queasy grin. We shall see who is laughing when all this is done, bitch.\nAsha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung it back down at the dancers, to whistles and loud cheers. \u201cYou\u2019d do well to heed what I told you about choosing a crew.\u201d A thrall offered them a platter, and she stabbed a salted fish and ate it off the end of her dirk. \u201cIf you had troubled to learn the first thing of Sigrin, I could never have fooled you. Ten years a wolf, and you land here and think to prince about the islands, but you know nothing and no one. Why should men fight and die for you? \u201c\n\u201cI am their lawful prince,\u201d Theon said stiffly.\n\u201cBy the laws of the green lands, you might be. But we make our own laws here, or have you forgotten?\u201d\nScowling, Theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before him. He would have stew in his lap before long. He shouted for a thrall to clean it up. Half my life I have waited to come home, and for what? Mockery and disregard? This was not the Pyke he remembered. Or did he remember? He had been so young when they took him away to hold hostage.\nThe feast was a meager enough thing, a succession of fish stews, black bread, and spiceless goat. The tastiest thing Theon found to eat was an onion pie. Ale and wine continued to flow well after the last of the courses had been cleared away.\nLord Balon Greyjoy rose from the Seastone Chair. \u201cHave done with your drink and come to my solar,\u201d he commanded his companions on the dais. \u201cWe have plans to lay.\u201d He left them with no other word, flanked by two of his guards. His brothers followed in short order. Theon rose to go after them.\n\u201cMy little brother is in a rush to be off.\u201d Asha raised her drinking horn and beckoned for more ale.\n\u201cOur lord father is waiting.\u201d\n\u201cAnd has, for many a year. It will do him no harm to wait a little longer\u2026 but if you fear his wrath, scurry after him by all means. You ought to have no trouble catching our uncles.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOne is drunk on seawater, after all, and the other is a great grey bullock so dim he\u2019ll probably get lost.\u201d\nTheon sat back down, annoyed. \u201cI run after no man.\u201d\n\u201cNo man, but every woman?\u201d\n\u201cIt was not me who grabbed your cock.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one, remember? You grabbed every other bit of me quick enough.\u201d\nHe could feel the flush creeping up his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m a man with a man\u2019s hungers. What sort of unnatural creature are you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly a shy maid.\u201d Asha\u2019s hand darted out under the table to give his cock a squeeze. Theon nearly jumped from his chair. \u201cWhat, don\u2019t you want me to steer you into port, brother?\u201d\n\u201cMarriage is not for you,\u201d Theon decided. \u201cWhen I rule, I believe I will pack you off to the silent sisters.\u201d He lurched to his feet and strode off unsteadily to find his father.\nRain was falling by the time he reached the swaying bridge out to the Sea Tower. His stomach was crashing and churning like the waves below, and wine had unsteadied his feet. Theon gritted his teeth and gripped the rope tightly as he made his way across, pretending that it was Asha\u2019s neck he was clutching.\nThe solar was as damp and drafty as ever. Buried under his sealskin robes, his father sat before the brazier with his brothers on either side of him. Victarion was talking of tides and winds when Theon entered, but Lord Balon waved him silent. \u201cI have made my plans. It is time you heard them.\u201d\n\u201cI have some suggestions\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhen I require your counsel I shall ask for it,\u201d his father said. \u201cWe have had a bird from Old Wyk. Dagmer is bringing the Drumms and Stonehouses. If the god grants us good winds, we will sail when they arrive\u2026 or you will. I mean for you to strike the first blow, Theon. You shall take eight longships north\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEight?\u201d His face reddened. \u201cWhat can I hope to accomplish with only eight longships?\u201d\n\u201cYou are to harry the Stony Shore, raiding the fishing villages and sinking any ships you chance to meet. It may be that you will draw some of the northern lords out from behind their stone walls. Aeron will accompany you, and Dagmer Cleftjaw.\u201d\n\u201cMay the Drowned God bless our swords,\u201d the priest said.\nTheon felt as if he\u2019d been slapped. He was being sent to do reaver\u2019s work, burning fishermen out of their hovels and raping their ugly daughters, and yet it seemed Lord Balon did not trust him sufficiently to do even that much. Bad enough to have to suffer the Damphair\u2019s scowls and chidings. With Dagmer Cleftjaw along as well, his command would be purely nominal.\n\u201cAsha my daughter,\u201d Lord Balon went on, and Theon turned to see that his sister had slipped in silently, \u201cyou shall take thirty longships of picked men round Sea Dragon Point. Land upon the tidal flats north of Deepwood Motte. March quickly, and the castle may fall before they even know you are upon them.\u201d\nAsha smiled like a cat in cream. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a castle,\u201d she said sweetly.\n\u201cThen take one.\u201d\nTheon had to bite his tongue. Deepwood Motte was the stronghold of the Glovers. With both Robett and Galbart warring in the south, it would be lightly held, and once the castle fell the ironmen would have a secure base in the heart of the north. I should be the one sent to take Deepwood. He knew Deepwood Motte, he had visited the Glovers several times with Eddard Stark.\n\u201cVictarion,\u201d Lord Balon said to his brother, \u201cthe main thrust shall fall to you. When my sons have struck their blows, Winterfell must respond. You should meet small opposition as you sail up Saltspear and the Fever River. At the headwaters, you will be less than twenty miles from Moat Cailin. The Neck is the key to the kingdom. Already we command the western seas. Once we hold Moat Cailin, the pup will not be able to win back to the north\u2026 and if he is fool enough to try, his enemies will seal the south end of the causeway behind him, and Robb the boy will find himself caught like a rat in a bottle.\u201d\nTheon could keep silent no longer. \u201cA bold plan, Father, but the lords in their castles\u2014\u201d\nLord Balon rode over him. \u201cThe lords are gone south with the pup. Those who remained behind are the cravens, old men, and green boys. They will yield or fall, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest and field and hall, and we shall make the folk our thralls and salt wives.\u201d\nAeron Damphair raised his arms. \u201cAnd the waters of wrath will rise high, and the Drowned God will spread his dominion across the green lands!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is dead can never die,\u201d Victarion intoned. Lord Balon and Asha echoed his words, and Theon had no choice but to mumble along with them. And then it was done.\nOutside the rain was falling harder than ever. The rope bridge twisted and writhed under his feet. Theon Greyjoy stopped in the center of the span and contemplated the rocks below. The sound of the waves was a crashing roar, and he could taste the salt spray on his lips. A sudden gust of wind made him lose his footing, and he stumbled to his knees.\nAsha helped him rise. \u201cYou can\u2019t hold your wine either, brother.\u201d\nTheon leaned on her shoulder and let her guide him across the rainslick boards. \u201cI liked you better when you were Esgred,\u201d he told her accusingly.\nShe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. I liked you better when you were nine.\u201d",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThrough the door came the soft sound of the high harp, mingled with a trilling of pipes. The singer\u2019s voice was muffled by the thick walls, yet Tyrion knew the verse. I loved a maid as fair as summer, he remembered, with sunlight in her hair\u2026\nSer Meryn Trant guarded the queen\u2019s door this night. His muttered \u201cMy lord\u201d struck Tyrion as a tad grudging, but he opened the door nonetheless. The song broke off abruptly as he strode into his sister\u2019s bedchamber.\nCersei was reclining on a pile of cushions. Her feet were bare, her golden hair artfully tousled, her robe a green-and-gold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as she looked up. \u201cSweet sister,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201chow beautiful you look tonight.\u201d He turned to the singer. \u201cAnd you as well, cousin. I had no notion you had such a lovely voice.\u201d\nThe compliment made Ser Lancel sulky; perhaps he thought he was being mocked. It seemed to Tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted. Lancel had thick sandy hair, green Lannister eyes, and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip. At sixteen, he was cursed with all the certainty of youth, unleavened by any trace of humor or self-doubt, and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome. His recent elevation had only made him worse. \u201cDid Her Grace send for you?\u201d the boy demanded.\n\u201cNot that I recall,\u201d Tyrion admitted. \u201cIt grieves me to disturb your revels, Lancel, but as it happens, I have matters of import to discuss with my sister.\u201d\nCersei regarded him suspiciously. \u201cIf you are here about those begging brothers, Tyrion, spare me your reproaches. I won\u2019t have them spreading their filthy treasons in the streets. They can preach to each other in the dungeons.\u201d\n\u201cAnd count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen,\u201d added Lancel. \u201cI would have had their tongues out.\u201d\n\u201cOne even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the rightful king,\u201d Cersei declared. \u201cIt will not be borne, Tyrion. I gave you ample opportunity to deal with these lice, but you and your Ser Jacelyn did nothing, so I commanded Vylarr to attend to the matter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so he did.\u201d Tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him, but they were not important enough to battle over. \u201cNo doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets. That is not why I came. I have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear, sweet sister, but they are best spoken of privily.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.\u201d The harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out, while Cersei kissed her cousin chastely on the cheek. \u201cLeave us, Lancel. My brother\u2019s harmless when he\u2019s alone. If he\u2019d brought his pets, we\u2019d smell them.\u201d\nThe young knight gave his cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight,\u201d Tyrion said when he was gone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very pleased with yourself, aren\u2019t you? Why?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tyrion said. Every day, every night, hammers rang along the Street of Steel, and the great chain grew longer. He hopped up onto the great canopied bed. \u201cIs this the bed where Robert died? I\u2019m surprised you kept it.\u201d\n\u201cIt gives me sweet dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cNow spit out your business and waddle away, Imp.\u201d\nTyrion smiled. \u201cLord Stannis has sailed from Dragonstone.\u201d\nCersei bolted to her feet. \u201cAnd yet you sit there grinning like a harvest-day pumpkin? Has Bywater called out the City Watch? We must send a bird to Harrenhal at once.\u201d He was laughing by then. She seized him by the shoulders and shook him. \u201cStop it. Are you mad, or drunk? Stop it!\u201d\nIt was all he could do to get out the words. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s too\u2026 gods, too funny\u2026 Stannis\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t sailed against us,\u201d Tyrion managed. \u201cHe\u2019s laid siege to Storm\u2019s End. Renly is riding to meet him.\u201d\nHis sister\u2019s nails dug painfully into his arms. For a moment she stared incredulous, as if he had begun to gibber in an unknown tongue. \u201cStannis and Renly are fighting each other?\u201d When he nodded, Cersei began to chuckle. \u201cGods be good,\u201d she gasped, \u201cI\u2019m starting to believe that Robert was the clever one.\u201d\nTyrion threw back his head and roared. They laughed together. Cersei pulled him off the bed and whirled him around and even hugged him, for a moment as giddy as a girl. By the time she let go of him, Tyrion was breathless and dizzy. He staggered to her sideboard and put out a hand to steady himself.\n\u201cDo you think it will truly come to battle between them? If they should come to some accord\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cThey are too different and yet too much alike, and neither could ever stomach the other.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Stannis has always felt he was cheated of Storm\u2019s End,\u201d Cersei said thoughtfully. \u201cThe ancestral seat of House Baratheon, his by rights\u2026 if you knew how many times he came to Robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has. When Robert gave the place to Renly, Stannis clenched his jaw so tight I thought his teeth would shatter.\u201d\n\u201cHe took it as a slight.\u201d\n\u201cIt was meant as a slight,\u201d Cersei said.\n\u201cShall we raise a cup to brotherly love?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, breathless. \u201cOh, gods, yes.\u201d\nHis back was to her as he filled two cups with sweet Arbor red. It was the easiest thing in the world to sprinkle a pinch of fine powder into hers. \u201cTo Stannis!\u201d he said as he handed her the wine. Harmless when I\u2019m alone, am I?\n\u201cTo Renly!\u201d she replied, laughing. \u201cMay they battle long and hard, and the Others take them both!\u201d\nIs this the Cersei that Jaime sees? When she smiled, you saw how beautiful she was, truly. I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in her hair. He almost felt sorry for poisoning her.\nIt was the next morning as he broke his fast that her messenger arrived. The queen was indisposed and would not be able to leave her chambers. Not able to leave her privy, more like. Tyrion made the proper sympathetic noises and sent word to Cersei to rest easy, he would treat with Ser Cleos as they\u2019d planned.\nThe Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably, and the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it, all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be. Yet there was one thing to be said for it. It was high.\nLannister guardsmen stood silent in their crimson cloaks and lioncrested halfhelms. Ser Jacelyn\u2019s gold cloaks faced them across the hall. The steps to the throne were flanked by Bronn and Ser Preston of the Kingsguard. Courtiers filled the gallery while supplicants clustered near the towering oak-and-bronze doors. Sansa Stark looked especially lovely this morning, though her face was as pale as milk. Lord Gyles stood coughing, while poor cousin Tyrek wore his bridegroom\u2019s mantle of miniver and velvet. Since his marriage to little Lady Ermesande three days past, the other squires had taken to calling him \u201cWet Nurse\u201d and asking him what sort of swaddling clothes his bride wore on their wedding night.\nTyrion looked down on them all, and found he liked it. \u201cCall forth Ser Cleos Frey.\u201d His voice rang off the stone walls and down the length of the hall. He liked that too. A pity Shae could not be here to see this, he reflected. She\u2019d asked to come, but it was impossible.\nSer Cleos made the long walk between the gold cloaks and the crimson, looking neither right nor left. As he knelt, Tyrion observed that his cousin was losing his hair.\n\u201cSer Cleos,\u201d Littlefinger said from the council table, \u201cyou have our thanks for bringing us this peace offer from Lord Stark.\u201d\nGrand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat. \u201cThe Queen Regent, the King\u2019s Hand, and the small council have considered the terms offered by this self-styled King in the North. Sad to say, they will not do, and you must tell these northmen so, ser.\u201d\n\u201cHere are our terms,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cRobb Stark must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to Winterfell. He must free my brother unharmed, and place his host under Jaime\u2019s command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis Baratheon. Each of Stark\u2019s bannermen must send us a son as hostage. A daughter will suffice where there is no son. They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new treasons.\u201d\nCleos Frey looked ill. \u201cMy lord Hand,\u201d he said, \u201cLord Stark will never consent to these terms.\u201d\nWe never expected he would, Cleos. \u201cTell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that he stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and Renly Baratheon war against each other, and the Prince of Dorne has consented to wed his son Trystane to the Princess Myrcella.\u201d Murmurs of delight and consternation alike arose from the gallery and the back of the hall.\n\u201cAs to this of my cousins,\u201d Tyrion went on, \u201cwe offer Harrion Karstark and Ser Wylis Manderly for Willem Lannister, and Lord Cerwyn and Ser Donnel Locke for your brother Tion. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are worth four northmen in any season.\u201d He waited for the laughter to die. \u201cHis father\u2019s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey\u2019s good faith.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stark asked for his sisters and his father\u2019s sword as well,\u201d Ser Cleos reminded him.\nSer Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark\u2019s greatsword rising over one shoulder. \u201cIce,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that when he makes his peace with us, not before.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. And his sisters?\u201d\nTyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as he said, \u201cUntil such time as he frees my brother Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as hostages. How well they are treated depends on him.\u201d And if the gods are good, Bywater will find Arya alive, before Robb learns she\u2019s gone missing.\n\u201cI shall bring him your message, my lord.\u201d\nTyrion plucked at one of the twisted blades that sprang from the arm of the throne. And now the thrust. \u201cVylarr,\u201d he called.\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d\n\u201cThe men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddard\u2019s bones, but a Lannister should have a Lannister escort,\u201d Tyrion declared. \u201cSer Cleos is the queen\u2019s cousin, and mine. We shall sleep more easily if you would see him safely back to Riverrun.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command. How many men should I take?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, all of them.\u201d\nVylarr stood like a man made of stone. It was Grand Maester Pycelle who rose, gasping, \u201cMy lord Hand, that cannot\u2026 your father, Lord Tywin himself, he sent these good men to our city to protect Queen Cersei and her children\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Kingsguard and the City Watch protect them well enough. The gods speed you on your way, Vylarr.\u201d\nAt the council table Varys smiled knowingly, Littlefinger sat feigning boredom, and Pycelle gaped like a fish, pale and confused. A herald stepped forward. \u201cIf any man has other matters to set before the King\u2019s Hand, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.\u201d\n\u201cI will be heard.\u201d A slender man all in black pushed his way between the Redwyne twins.\n\u201cSer Alliser!\u201d Tyrion exclaimed. \u201cWhy, I had no notion that you\u2019d come to court. You should have sent me word.\u201d\n\u201cI have, as well you know.\u201d Thorne was as prickly as his name, a spare, sharp-featured man of fifty, hard-eyed and hard-handed, his black hair streaked with grey. \u201cI have been shunned, ignored, and left to wait like some baseborn servant.\u201d\n\u201cTruly? Bronn, this was not well done. Ser Alliser and I are old friends. We walked the Wall together.\u201d\n\u201cSweet Ser Alliser,\u201d murmured Varys, \u201cyou must not think too harshly of us. So many seek our Joffrey\u2019s grace, in these troubled and tumultuous times.\u201d\n\u201cMore troubled than you know, eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cTo his face we call him Lord Eunuch,\u201d quipped Littlefinger.\n\u201cHow may we be of help to you, good brother?\u201d Grand Maester Pycelle asked in soothing tones.\n\u201cThe Lord Commander sent me to His Grace the king,\u201d Thorne answered. \u201cThe matter is too grave to be left to servants.\u201d\n\u201cThe king is playing with his new crossbow,\u201d Tyrion said. Ridding himself of Joffrey had required only an ungainly Myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time, and nothing would do but that he try it at once. \u201cYou can speak to servants or hold your silence.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will,\u201d Ser Alliser said, displeasure in every word. \u201cI am sent to tell you that we found two rangers, long missing. They were dead, yet when we brought the corpses back to the Wall they rose again in the night. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker, while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander.\u201d\nDistantly, Tyrion heard someone snigger. Does he mean to mock me with this folly? He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle, wondering if one of them had a role in this. A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity. Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him, he was doomed. And yet\u2026 and yet\u2026\nTyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he\u2019d stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world, gazing out at the trackless dark beyond. He had felt\u2014what?\u2014something, to be sure, a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind. A wolf had howled off in the night, and the sound had sent a shiver through him.\nDon\u2019t be a fool, he told himself. A wolf, a wind, a dark forest, it meant nothing. And yet\u2026 He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black. \u201cI trust that the Old Bear survived this attack?\u201d\n\u201cHe did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that your brothers killed these, ah, dead men?\u201d\n\u201cWe did.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re certain that they are dead this time?\u201d Tyrion asked mildly. When Bronn choked on a snort of laughter, he knew how he must proceed. \u201cTruly truly dead?\u201d\n\u201cThey were dead the first time,\u201d Ser Alliser snapped. \u201cPale and cold, with black hands and feet. I brought Jared\u2019s hand, torn from his corpse by the bastard\u2019s wolf.\u201d\nLittlefinger stirred. \u201cAnd where is this charming token?\u201d\nSer Alliser frowned uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2026 rotted to pieces while I waited, unheard. There\u2019s naught left to show but bones.\u201d\nTitters echoed through the hall. \u201cLord Baelish,\u201d Tyrion called down to Littlefinger, \u201cbuy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him.\u201d\n\u201cSpades?\u201d Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously.\n\u201cIf you bury your dead, they won\u2019t come walking,\u201d Tyrion told him, and the court laughed openly. \u201cSpades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield them. Ser Jacelyn, see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons.\u201d\nSer Jacelyn Bywater said, \u201cAs you will, my lord, but the cells are near empty. Yoren took all the likely men.\u201d\n\u201cArrest some more, then,\u201d Tyrion told him. \u201cOr spread the word that there\u2019s bread and turnips on the Wall, and they\u2019ll go of their own accord.\u201d The city had too many mouths to feed, and the Night\u2019s Watch a perpetual need of men. At Tyrion\u2019s signal, the herald cried an end, and the hall began to empty.\nSer Alliser Thorne was not so easily dismissed. He was waiting at the foot of the iron Throne when Tyrion descended. \u201cDo you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to be mocked by the likes of you?\u201d he fumed, blocking the way. \u201cThis is no jape. I saw it with my own eyes. I tell you, the dead walk.\u201d\n\u201cYou should try to kill them more thoroughly.\u201d Tyrion pushed past. Ser Alliser made to grab his sleeve, but Preston Greenfield thrust him back. \u201cNo closer, ser.\u201d\nThorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the Kingsguard. \u201cYou are a fool, Imp,\u201d he shouted at Tyrion\u2019s back.\nThe dwarf turned to face him. \u201cMe? Truly? Then why were they laughing at you, I wonder?\u201d He smiled wanly. \u201cYou came for men, did you not?\u201d\n\u201cThe cold winds are rising. The Wall must be held.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to hold it you need men, which I\u2019ve given you\u2026 as you might have noted, if your ears heard anything but insults. Take them, thank me, and begone before I\u2019m forced to take a crab fork to you again. Give my warm regards to Lord Mormont\u2026 and to Jon Snow as well.\u201d Bronn seized Ser Alliser by the elbow and marched him forcefully from the hall.\nGrand Maester Pycelle had already scuttled off, but Varys and Littlefinger had watched it all, start to finish. \u201cI grow ever more admiring of you, my lord,\u201d confessed the eunuch. \u201cYou appease the Stark boy with his father\u2019s bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke. You give that black brother the men he seeks, rid the city of some hungry mouths, yet make it all seem mockery so none may say that the dwarf fears snarks and grumkins. Oh, deftly done.\u201d\nLittlefinger stroked his beard. \u201cDo you truly mean to send away all your guards, Lannister?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean to send away all my sister\u2019s guards.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen will never allow that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think she may. I am her brother, and when you\u2019ve known me longer, you\u2019ll learn that I mean everything I say.\u201d\n\u201cEven the lies?\u201d\n\u201cEspecially the lies. Lord Petyr, I sense that you are unhappy with me.\u201d\n\u201cI love you as much as I ever have, my lord. Though I do not relish being played for a fool. if Myrcella weds Trystane Martell, she can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can she?\u201d\n\u201cNot without causing a great scandal,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI regret my little ruse, Lord Petyr, but when we spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer.\u201d\nLittlefinger was not appeased. \u201cI do not like being lied to, my lord. Leave me out of your next deception.\u201d\nOnly if you\u2019ll do the same for me, Tyrion thought, glancing at the dagger sheathed at Littlefinger\u2019s hip. \u201cIf I have given offense, I am deeply sorry. All men know how much we love you, my lord. And how much we need you.\u201d\n\u201cTry and remember that.\u201d With that Littlefinger left them.\n\u201cWalk with me, Varys,\u201d said Tyrion. They left through the king\u2019s door behind the throne, the eunuch\u2019s slippers whisking lightly over the stone.\n\u201cLord Baelish has the truth of it, you know. The queen will never permit you to send away her guard.\u201d\n\u201cShe will. You\u2019ll see to that.\u201d\nA smile flickered across Varys\u2019s plump lips. \u201cWill I?\u201d\n\u201cOh, for a certainty. You\u2019ll tell her it is part of my scheme to free Jaime.\u201d\nVarys stroked a powdered cheek. \u201cThis would doubtless involve the four men your man Bronn searched for so diligently in all the low places of King\u2019s Landing. A thief, a poisoner, a mummer, and a murderer.\u201d\n\u201cPut them in crimson cloaks and lion helms, they\u2019ll look no different from any other guardsmen. I searched for some time for a ruse that might get them into Riverrun before I thought to hide them in plain sight. They\u2019ll ride in by the main gate, flying Lannister banners and escorting Lord Eddard\u2019s bones.\u201d He smiled crookedly. \u201cFour men alone would be watched vigilantly. Four among a hundred can lose themselves. So I must send the true guardsmen as well as the false\u2026 as you\u2019ll tell my sister.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for the sake of her beloved brother, she will consent, despite her misgivings.\u201d They made their way down a deserted colonnade. \u201cStill, the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy.\u201d\n\u201cI like her uneasy,\u201d said Tyrion.\nSer Cleos Frey left that very afternoon, escorted by Vylarr and a hundred red-cloaked Lannister guardsmen. The men Robb Stark had sent joined them at the King\u2019s Gate for the long ride west.\nTyrion found Timett dicing with his Burned Men in the barracks. \u201cCome to my solar at midnight.\u201d Timett gave him a hard one-eyed stare, a curt nod. He was not one for long speeches.\nThat night he feasted with the Stone Crows and Moon Brothers in the Small Hall, though he shunned the wine for once. He wanted all his wits about him. \u201cShagga, what moon is this?\u201d\nShagga\u2019s frown was a fierce thing. \u201cBlack, I think.\u201d\n\u201cIn the west, they call that a traitor\u2019s moon. Try not to get too drunk tonight, and see that your axe is sharp.\u201d\n\u201cA Stone Crow\u2019s axe is always sharp, and Shagga\u2019s axes are sharpest of all. Once I cut off a man\u2019s head, but he did not know it until he tried to brush his hair. Then it fell off.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you never brush yours?\u201d The Stone Crows roared and stamped their feet, Shagga hooting loudest of all.\nBy midnight, the castle was silent and dark. Doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls spied them leaving the Tower of the Hand, but no one raised a voice. He was the Hand of the King, and where he went was his own affair.\nThe thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of Shagga\u2019s boot. Pieces went flying inward, and Tyrion heard a woman\u2019s gasp of fear. Shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins. Timett followed, and then Tyrion, stepping gingerly over the splinters. The fire had burned down a few glowing embers, and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber. When Timett ripped the heavy curtains off the bed, the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes. \u201cPlease, my lords,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cdon\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She cringed away from Shagga, flushed and fearful, trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short.\n\u201cGo,\u201d Tyrion told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not you we want.\u201d\n\u201cShagga wants this woman.\u201d\n\u201cShagga wants every whore in this city of whores,\u201d complained Timett son of Timett.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Shagga said, unabashed. \u201cShagga would give her a strong child.\u201d\n\u201cIf she wants a strong child, she\u2019ll know whom to seek,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cTimett, see her out\u2026 gently, if you would.\u201d\nThe Burned Man pulled the girl from the bed and half marched, half dragged her across the chamber. Shagga watched them go, mournful as a puppy. The girl stumbled over the shattered door and out into the hall, helped along by a firm shove from Timett. Above their heads, the ravens were screeching.\nTyrion dragged the soft blanket off the bed, uncovering Grand Maester Pycelle beneath. \u201cTell me, does the Citadel approve of you bedding the serving wenches, Maester?\u201d\nThe old man was as naked as the girl, though he made a markedly less attractive sight. For once, his heavy-lidded eyes were open wide. \u201cW-what is the meaning of this? I am an old man, your loyal servant\u2026\u201d\nTyrion hoisted himself onto the bed. \u201cSo loyal that you sent only one of my letters to Doran Martell. The other you gave to my sister.\u201d\n\u201cN-no,\u201d squealed Pycelle. \u201cNo, a falsehood, I swear it, it was not me. Varys, it was Varys, the Spider, I warned you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo all maesters lie so poorly? I told Varys that I was giving Prince Doran my nephew Tommen to foster. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed Myrcella to Lord Robert of the Eyrie. I told no one that I had offered Myrcella to the Dornish\u2026 that truth was only in the letter I entrusted to you.\u201d\nPycelle clutched for a corner of the blanket. \u201cBirds are lost, messages stolen or sold\u2026 it was Varys, there are things I might tell you of that eunuch that would chill your blood\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy lady prefers my blood hot.\u201d\n\u201cMake no mistake, for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear, he holds seven back. And Littlefinger, that one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know all about Lord Petyr. He\u2019s almost as untrustworthy as you. Shagga, cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.\u201d\nShagga hefted the huge double-bladed axe. \u201cThere are no goats, Halfman.\u201d\n\u201cMake do.\u201d\nRoaring, Shagga leapt forward. Pycelle shrieked and wet the bed, urine spraying in all directions as he tried to scramble back out of reach. The wildling caught him by the end of his billowy white beard and hacked off three-quarters of it with a single slash of the axe.\n\u201cTimett, do you suppose our friend will be more forthcoming without those whiskers to hide behind?\u201d Tyrion used a bit of the sheet to wipe the piss off his boots.\n\u201cHe will tell the truth soon.\u201d Darkness pooled in the empty pit of Timett\u2019s burned eye. \u201cI can smell the stink of his fear.\u201d\nShagga tossed a handful of hair down to the rushes, and seized what beard was left. \u201cHold still, Maester,\u201d urged Tyrion. \u201cWhen Shagga gets angry, his hands shake.\u201d\n\u201cShagga\u2019s hands never shake,\u201d the huge man said indignantly, pressing the great crescent blade under Pycelle\u2019s quivering chin and sawing through another tangle of beard.\n\u201cHow long have you been spying for my sister?\u201d Tyrion asked.\nPycelle\u2019s breathing was rapid and shallow. \u201cAll I did, I did for House Lannister.\u201d A sheen of sweat covered the broad dome of the old man\u2019s brow, and wisps of white hair clung to his wrinkled skin. \u201cAlways\u2026 for years\u2026 your lord father, ask him, I was ever his true servant\u2026\u2019twas I who bid Aerys open his gates\u2026\u201d\nThat took Tyrion by surprise. He had been no more than an ugly boy at Casterly Rock when the city fell. \u201cSo the Sack of King\u2019s Landing was your work as well?\u201d\n\u201cFor the realm! Once Rhaegar died, the war was done. Aerys was mad, Viserys too young, Prince Aegon a babe at the breast, but the realm needed a king\u2026 I prayed it should be your good father, but Robert was too strong, and Lord Stark moved too swiftly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow many have you betrayed, I wonder? Aerys, Eddard Stark, me\u2026 King Robert as well? Lord Arryn, Prince Rhaegar? Where does it begin, Pycelle?\u201d He knew where it ended.\nThe axe scratched at the apple of Pycelle\u2019s throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under his jaw, scraping away the last hairs. \u201cYou\u2026 were not here,\u201d he gasped when the blade moved upward to his cheeks. \u201cRobert\u2026 his wounds\u2026 if you had seen them, smelled them, you would have no doubt\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know the boar did your work for you\u2026 but if he\u2019d left the job half done, doubtless you would have finished it.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a wretched king\u2026 vain, drunken, lecherous\u2026 he would have set your sister aside, his own queen\u2026 please\u2026 Renly was plotting to bring the Highgarden maid to court, to entice his brother\u2026 it is the gods\u2019 own truth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd what was Lord Arryn plotting?\u201d\n\u201cHe knew,\u201d Pycelle said. \u201cAbout\u2026 about\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know what he knew about,\u201d snapped Tyrion, who was not anxious for Shagga and Timett to know as well.\n\u201cHe was sending his wife back to the Eyrie, and his son to be fostered on Dragonstone\u2026 he meant to act\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo you poisoned him first.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pycelle struggled feebly. Shagga growled and grabbed his head. The clansman\u2019s hand was so big he could have crushed the maester\u2019s skull like an eggshell had he squeezed.\nTyrion tsked at him. \u201cI saw the tears of Lys among your potions. And you sent away Lord Arryn\u2019s own maester and tended him yourself, so you could make certain that he died.\u201d\n\u201cA falsehood!\u201d\n\u201cShave him closer,\u201d Tyrion suggested. \u201cThe throat again.\u201d\nThe axe swept back down, rasping over the skin. A thin film of spit bubbled on Pycelle\u2019s lips as his mouth trembled. \u201cI tried to save Lord Arryn. I vow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCareful now, Shagga, you\u2019ve cut him.\u201d\nShagga growled. \u201cDolf fathered warriors, not barbers.\u201d\nWhen he felt the blood trickling down his neck and onto his chest, the old man shuddered, and the last strength went out of him. He looked shrunken, both smaller and frailer than he had been when they burst in on him. \u201cYes,\u201d he wimpered, \u201cyes, Colemon was purging, so I sent him away. The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, she did not say so, could not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at her I knew. It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear it.\u201d The old man wept. \u201cVarys will tell you, it was the boy, his squire, Hugh he was called, he must surely have done it, ask your sister, ask her.\u201d\nTyrion was disgusted. \u201cBind him and take him away,\u201d he commanded. \u201cThrow him down in one of the black cells.\u201d\nThey dragged him out the splintered door. \u201cLannister,\u201d he moaned, \u201call I\u2019ve done has been for Lannister\u2026\u201d\nWhen he was gone, Tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few more small jars from his shelves. The ravens muttered above his head as he worked, a strangely peaceful noise. He would need to find someone to tend the birds until the Citadel sent a man to replace Pycelle.\nHe was the one I\u2019d hoped to trust. Varys and Littlefinger were no more loyal, he suspected\u2026 only more subtle, and thus more dangerous. Perhaps his father\u2019s way would have been best: summon Ilyn Payne, mount three heads above the gates, and have done. And wouldn\u2019t that be a pretty sight, he thought.",

      "content": "Arya\nFear cuts deeper than swords, Arya would tell herself, but that did not make the fear go away. It was as much a part of her days as stale bread and the blisters on her toes after a long day of walking the hard, rutted road.\nShe had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid, but she learned better in that storehouse beside the Gods Eye. Eight days she had lingered there before the Mountain gave the command to march, and every day she had seen someone die.\nThe Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning. The village folk would never look at him. Maybe they thought that if they did not notice him, he would not notice them\u2026 but he saw them anyway and picked whom he liked. There was no place to hide, no tricks to play, no way to be safe.\nOne girl shared a soldier\u2019s bed three nights running; the Mountain picked her on the fourth day, and the soldier said nothing.\nA smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son, off serving in the gold cloaks at King\u2019s Landing. \u201cA king\u2019s man, he is,\u201d he would say, \u201ca good king\u2019s man like me, all for Joffrey.\u201d He said it so often the other captives began to call him All-for-Joffrey whenever the guards weren\u2019t listening. All-for-Joffrey was picked on the fifth day.\nA young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they\u2019d promise not to hurt her daughter. The Mountain heard her out; the next morning he picked her daughter, to be certain she\u2019d held nothing back.\nThe ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives, so they could see the fate of rebels and traitors. A man the others called the Tickler asked the questions. His face was so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers before she had seen him at his work. \u201cTickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves,\u201d old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them. He was the man she\u2019d tried to bite, who\u2019d called her a fierce little thing and smashed her head with a mailed fist. Sometimes he helped the Tickler. Sometimes others did that. Ser Gregor Clegane himself would stand motionless, watching and listening, until the victim died.\nThe questions were always the same. Was there gold hidden in the village? Silver, gems? Was there more food? Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion? Which of the village folk had aided him? When he rode off, where did he go? How many men were with them? How many knights, how many bowmen, how many men-at-arms? How were they armed? How many were horsed? How many were wounded? What other enemy had they seen? How many? When? What banners did they fly? Where did they go? Was there gold hidden in the village? Silver, gems? Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion? How many men were with him? By the third day, Arya could have asked the questions herself.\nThey found a little gold, a little silver, a great sack of copper pennies, and a dented goblet set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to blows over. They learned that Lord Beric had ten starvelings with him, or else a hundred mounted knights; that he had ridden west, or north, or south; that he had crossed the lake in a boat; that he was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux. No one ever survived the Tickler\u2019s questioning; no man, no woman, no child. The strongest lasted past evenfall. Their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the wolves.\nBy the time they marched, Arya knew she was no water dancer. Syrio Forel would never have let them knock him down and take his sword away, nor stood by when they killed Lommy Greenhands. Syrio would never have sat silent in that storehouse nor shuffled along meekly among the other captives. The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks, but Arya felt more a lamb, surrounded by a herd of other sheep. She hated the villagers for their sheepishness, almost as much as she hated herself.\nThe Lannisters had taken everything: father, friends, home, hope, courage. One had taken Needle, while another had broken her wooden stick sword over his knee. They had even taken her stupid secret. The storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water in some corner when no one was looking, but it was different on the road. She held it as long as she could, but finally she had to squat by a bush and skin down her breeches in front of all of them. It was that or wet herself. Hot Pie gaped at her with big moon eyes, but no one else even troubled to look. Girl sheep or boy sheep, Ser Gregor and his men did not seem to care.\nTheir captors permitted no chatter. A broken lip taught Arya to hold her tongue. Others never learned at all. One boy of three would not stop calling for his father, so they smashed his face in with a spiked mace. Then the boy\u2019s mother started screaming and Raff the Sweetling killed her as well.\nArya watched them die and did nothing. What good did it do you to be brave? One of the women picked for questioning had tried to be brave, but she had died screaming like all the rest. There were no brave people on that march, only scared and hungry ones. Most were women and children. The few men were very old or very young; the rest had been chained to that gibbet and left for the wolves and the crows. Gendry was only spared because he\u2019d admitted to forging the horned helm himself; smiths, even apprentice smiths, were too valuable to kill.\nThey were being taken to serve Lord Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal, the Mountain told them. \u201cYou\u2019re traitors and rebels, so thank your gods that Lord Tywin\u2019s giving you this chance. It\u2019s more than you\u2019d get from the outlaws. Obey, serve, and live.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just, it\u2019s not,\u201d she heard one wizened old woman complain to another when they had bedded down for the night. \u201cWe never did no treason, the others come in and took what they wanted, same as this bunch.\u201d\n\u201cLord Beric did us no hurt, though,\u201d her friend whispered. \u201cAnd that red priest with him, he paid for all they took.\u201d\n\u201cPaid? He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?\u201d She looked about to see that no guards were near, and spat three times. \u201cThere\u2019s for the Tullys and there\u2019s for the Lannisters and there\u2019s for the Starks.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sin and a shame,\u201d an old man hissed. \u201cWhen the old king was still alive, he\u2019d not have stood for this.\u201d\n\u201cKing Robert?\u201d Arya asked, forgetting herself.\n\u201cKing Aerys, gods grace him,\u201d the old man said, too loudly. A guard came sauntering over to shut them up. The old man lost both his teeth, and there was no more talk that night.\nBesides his captives, Ser Gregor was bringing back a dozen pigs, a cage of chickens, a scrawny milk cow, and nine wagons of salt fish. The Mountain and his men had horses, but the captives were all afoot, and those too weak to keep up were killed out of hand, along with anyone foolish enough to flee. The guards took women off into the bushes at night, and most seemed to expect it and went along meekly enough. One girl, prettier than the others, was made to go with four or five different men every night, until finally she hit one with a rock. Ser Gregor made everyone watch while he took off her head with a sweep of his massive two-handed greatsword. \u201cLeave the body for the wolves,\u201d he commanded when the deed was done, handing the sword to his squire to be cleaned.\nArya glanced sidelong at Needle, sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded, balding man-at-arms called Polliver. It\u2019s good that they took it away, she thought. Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor, and he would have cut her right in half, and the wolves would eat her too.\nPolliver was not so bad as some of the others, even though he\u2019d stolen Needle. The night she was caught, the Lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as their nasal helms, but she\u2019d come to know them all. You had to know who was lazy and who was cruel, who was smart and who was stupid. You had to learn that even though the one they called Shitmouth had the foulest tongue she\u2019d ever heard, he\u2019d give you an extra piece of bread if you asked, while jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff would just give you the back of their hand.\nArya watched and listened and polished her hates the way Gendry had once polished his horned helm. Dunsen wore those bull\u2019s horns now, and she hated him for it. She hated Polliver for Needle, and she hated old Chiswyck who thought he was funny. And Raff the Sweetling, who\u2019d driven his spear through Lommy\u2019s throat, she hated even more. She hated Ser Amory Lorch for Yoren, and she hated Ser Meryn Trant for Syrio, the Hound for killing the butcher\u2019s boy Mycah, and Ser Ilyn and Prince Joffrey and the queen for the sake of her father and Fat Tom and Desmond and the rest, and even for Lady, Sansa\u2019s wolf. The Tickler was almost too scary to hate. At times she could almost forget he was still with them; when he was not asking questions, he was just another soldier, quieter than most, with a face like a thousand other men.\nEvery night Arya would say their names. \u201cSer Gregor,\u201d she\u2019d whisper to her stone pillow. \u201cDunsen, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\u201d Back in Winterfell, Arya had prayed with her mother in the sept and with her father in the godswood, but there were no gods on the road to Harrenhal, and her names were the only prayer she cared to remember.\nEvery day they marched, and every night she said her names, until finally the trees thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling hills, meandering streams, and sunlit fields, where the husks of burnt holdfasts thrust up black as rotten teeth. It was another long day\u2019s march before they glimpsed the towers of Harrenhal in the distance, hard beside the blue waters of the lake.\nIt would be better once they got to Harrenhal, the captives told each other, but Arya was not so certain. She remembered Old Nan\u2019s stories of the castle built on fear. Harren the Black had mixed human blood in the mortar, Nan used to say, dropping her voice so the children would need to lean close to hear, but Aegon\u2019s dragons had roasted Harren and all his sons within their great walls of stone. Arya chewed her lip as she walked along on feet grown hard with callus. It would not be much longer, she told herself; those towers could not be more than a few miles off.\nYet they walked all that day and most of the next before at last they reached the fringes of Lord Tywin\u2019s army, encamped west of the castle amidst the scorched remains of a town. Harrenhal was deceptive from afar, because it was so huge. Its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake, sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs, while atop their battlements the rows of wood-and-iron scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named.\nThe stink of the Lannister host reached Arya well before she could make out the devices on the banners that sprouted along the lakeshore, atop the pavilions of the westermen. From the smell, Arya could tell that Lord Tywin had been here some time. The latrines that ringed the encampment were overflowing and swarming with flies, and she saw faint greenish fuzz on many of the sharpened stakes that protected the perimeters.\nHarrenhal\u2019s gatehouse, itself as large as Winterfell\u2019s Great Keep, was as scarred as it was massive, its stones fissured and discolored. From outside, only the tops of five immense towers could be seen beyond the walls. The shortest of them was half again as tall as the highest tower in Winterfell, but they did not soar the way a proper tower did. Arya thought they looked like some old man\u2019s gnarled, knuckly fingers groping after a passing cloud. She remembered Nan telling how the stone had melted and flowed like candlewax down the steps and in the windows, glowing a sullen searing red as it sought out Harren where he hid. Arya could believe every word; each tower was more grotesque and misshapen than the last, lumpy and runneled and cracked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go there,\u201d Hot Pie squeaked as Harrenhal opened its gates to them. \u201cThere\u2019s ghosts in there.\u201d\nChiswyck heard him, but for once he only smiled. \u201cBaker boy, here\u2019s your choice. Come join the ghosts, or be one.\u201d\nHot Pie went in with the rest of them.\nIn the echoing stone-and-timber bathhouse, the captives were stripped and made to scrub and scrape themselves raw in tubs of scalding hot water. Two fierce old women supervised the process, discussing them as bluntly as if they were newly acquired donkeys. When Arya\u2019s turn came round, Goodwife Amabel clucked in dismay at the sight of her feet, while Goodwife Harra felt the callus on her fingers that long hours of practice with Needle had earned her. \u201cGot those churning butter, I\u2019ll wager,\u201d she said. \u201cSome farmer\u2019s whelp, are you? Well, never you mind, girl, you have a chance to win a higher place in this world if you work hard. If you won\u2019t work hard, you\u2019ll be beaten. And what do they call you?\u201d\nArya dared not say her true name, but Arry was no good either, it was a boy\u2019s name and they could see she was no boy. \u201cWeasel,\u201d she said, naming the first girl she could think of. \u201cLommy called me Weasel.\u201d\n\u201cI can see why,\u201d sniffed Goodwife Amabel. \u201cThat hair is a fright and a nest for lice as well. We\u2019ll have it off, and then you\u2019re for the kitchens.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner tend the horses.\u201d Arya liked horses, and maybe if she was in the stables she\u2019d be able to steal one and escape.\nGoodwife Harra slapped her so hard that her swollen lip broke open all over again. \u201cAnd keep that tongue to yourself or you\u2019ll get worse. No one asked your views.\u201d\nThe blood in her mouth had a salty metal tang to it. Arya dropped her gaze and said nothing. If I still had Needle, she wouldn\u2019t dare hit me, she thought sullenly.\n\u201cLord Tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend their horses, they don\u2019t need the likes of you,\u201d Goodwife Amabel said. \u201cThe kitchens are snug and clean, and there\u2019s always a warm fire to sleep by and plenty to eat. You might have done well there, but I can see you\u2019re not a clever girl. Harra, I believe we should give this one to Weese.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think so, Amabel.\u201d They gave her a shift of grey roughspun wool and a pair of ill-fitting shoes, and sent her off.\nWeese was understeward for the Wailing Tower, a squat man with a fleshy carbuncle of a nose and a nest of angry red boils near one corner of his plump lips. Arya was one of six sent to him. He looked them all over with a gimlet eye. \u201cThe Lannisters are generous to those as serve them well, an honor none of your sort deserve, but in war a man makes do with what\u2019s to hand. Work hard and mind your place and might be one day you\u2019ll rise as high as me. If you think to presume on his lordship\u2019s kindness, though, you\u2019ll find me waiting after m\u2019lord has gone, y\u2019see.\u201d He strutted up and down before them, telling them how they must never look the highborn in the eye, nor speak until spoken to, nor get in his lordship\u2019s way. \u201cMy nose never lies,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI can smell defiance, I can smell pride, I can smell disobedience. I catch a whiff of any such stinks, you\u2019ll answer for it. When I sniff you, all I want to smell is fear.\u201d",

      "content": "Daenerys\nOn the walls of Qarth, men beat gongs to herald her coming, while others blew curious horns that encircled their bodies like great bronze snakes. A column of camelry emerged from the city as her honor guards. The riders wore scaled copper armor and snouted helms with copper tusks and long black silk plumes, and sat high on saddles inlaid with rubies and garnets. Their camels were dressed in blankets of a hundred different hues.\n\u201cQarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be,\u201d Pyat Pree had told her, back amongst the bones of Vaes Tolorro. \u201cIt is the center of the world, the gate between north and south, the bridge between east and west, ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that Saathos the Wise put out his eyes after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison.\u201d\nDany took the warlock\u2019s words well salted, but the magnificence of the great city was not to be denied. Three thick walls encircled Qarth, elaborately carved. The outer was red sandstone, thirty feet high and decorated with animals: snakes slithering, kites flying, fish swimming, intermingled with wolves of the red waste and striped zorses and monstrous elephants. The middle wall, forty feet high, was grey granite alive with scenes of war: the clash of sword and shield and spear, arrows in flight, heroes at battle and babes being butchered, pyres of the dead. The innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble, with carvings that made Dany blush until she told herself that she was being a fool. She was no maid; if she could look on the grey wall\u2019s scenes of slaughter, why should she avert her eyes from the sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another?\nThe outer gates were banded with copper, the middle with iron; the innermost were studded with golden eyes. All opened at Dany\u2019s approach. As she rode her silver into the city, small children rushed out to scatter flowers in her path. They wore golden sandals and bright paint, no more.\nAll the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth; buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose, violet, and umber. She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating, their scales delicate flakes of jade, obsidian, and lapis lazuli. Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had ever seen, and elaborate fountains filled every square, wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores.\nThe Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support their weight. They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur, every one a lord or lady to her eyes. The women wore gowns that left one breast bare, while the men favored beaded silk skirts. Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin robe with black Drogon on one shoulder. Her Dothraki called the Qartheen \u201cMilk Men\u201d for their paleness, and Khal Drogo had dreamed of the day when he might sack the great cities of the east. She glanced at her bloodriders, their dark almond-shaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts. Is it only the plunder they see? she wondered. How savage we must seem to these Qartheen.\nPyrat Pree conducted her little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the city\u2019s ancient heroes stood thrice life-size on columns of white and green marble. They passed through a bazaar in a cavernous building whose latticework ceiling was home to a thousand gaily colored birds. Trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls, while below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale.\nHer silver shied as the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos rode up to her; the horses could not abide the close presence of camels, she had found. \u201cIf you see here anything that you would desire, O most beautiful of women, you have only to speak and it is yours,\u201d Xaro called down from his ornate horned saddle.\n\u201cQarth itself is hers, she has no need of baubles,\u201d blue-lipped Pyat Pree sang out from her other side. \u201cIt shall be as I promised, Khaleesi. Come with me to the House of the Undying, and you shall drink of truth and wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should she need your Palace of Dust, when I can give her sunlight and sweet water and silks to sleep in?\u201d Xaro said to the warlock. \u201cThe Thirteen shall set a crown of black jade and fire opals upon her lovely head.\u201d\n\u201cThe only palace I desire is the red castle at King\u2019s Landing, my lord Pyat.\u201d Dany was wary of the warlock; the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had soured her on those who played at sorcery. \u201cAnd if the great of Qarth would give me gifts, Xaro, let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine.\u201d\nPyat\u2019s blue lips curled upward in a gracious smile. \u201cit shall be as you command, Khaleesi.\u201d He moved away, swaying with his camel\u2019s motion, his long beaded robes trailing behind.\n\u201cThe young queen is wise beyond her years,\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos murmured down at her from his high saddle. \u201cThere is a saying in Qarth. A warlock\u2019s house is built of bones and lies.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of Qarth? All across the east, their power and wisdom are revered.\u201d\n\u201cOnce they were mighty,\u201d Xaro agreed, \u201cbut now they are as ludicrous as those feeble old soldiers who boast of their prowess long after strength and skill have left them. They read their crumbling scrolls, drink shade-of-the-evening until their lips turn blue, and hint of dread powers, but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before. Pyat Pree\u2019s gifts will turn to dust in your hands, I warn you.\u201d He gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away.\n\u201cThe crow calls the raven black,\u201d muttered Ser Jorah in the Common Tongue of Westeros. The exile knight rode at her right hand, as ever. For their entrance into Qarth, he had put away his Dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the Seven Kingdoms half a world away. \u201cYou would do well to avoid both those men, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cThose men will help me to my crown,\u201d she said. \u201cXaro has vast wealth, and Pyat Pree\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014pretends to power,\u201d the knight said brusquely. On his dark green surcoat, the bear of House Mormont stood on its hind legs, black and fierce. Jorah looked no less ferocious as he scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar. \u201cI would not linger here long, my queen. I mislike the very smell of this place.\u201d\nDany smiled. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the camels you\u2019re smelling. The Qartheen themselves seem sweet enough to my nose.\u201d\n\u201cSweet smells are sometimes used to cover foul ones.\u201d\nMy great bear, Dany thought. I am his queen, but I will always be his cub as well, and he will always guard me. It made her feel safe, but sad as well. She wished she could love him better than she did.\nXaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the city. She had expected something grand. She had not expected a palace larger than many a market town. It makes Magister Illyrio\u2019s manse in Pentos look like a swineherd\u2019s hovel, she thought. Xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides; indeed, it swallowed them. An entire wing was given over to her. She would have her own gardens, a marble bathing pool, a scrying tower and warlock\u2019s maze. Slaves would tend her every need. In her private chambers, the floors were green marble, the walls draped with colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air. \u201cYou are too generous,\u201d she told Xaro Xhoan Daxos.\n\u201cFor the Mother of Dragons, no gift is too great.\u201d Xaro was a languid, elegant man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose crusted with rubies, opals, and flakes of jade. \u201cOn the morrow, you shall feast upon peacock and lark\u2019s tongue, and hear music worthy of the most beautiful of women. The Thirteen will come to do you homage, and all the great of Qarth.\u201d\nAll the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons, Dany thought, yet she thanked Xaro for his kindness before she sent him on his way. Pyat Pree took his leave as well, vowing to petition the Undying Ones for an audience. \u201cA honor rare as summer snows.\u201d Before he left he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift, a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air. Last of the three seekers to depart was Quaithe the shadowbinder. From her Dany received only a warning. \u201cBeware,\u201d the woman in the red lacquer mask said.\n\u201cOf whom?\u201d\n\u201cOf all. They shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into the world, and when they see they shall lust. For dragons are fire made flesh, and fire is power.\u201d\nWhen Quaithe too was gone, Ser Jorah said, \u201cShe speaks truly, my queen\u2026 though I like her no more than the others.\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand her.\u201d Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons, declaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen the woman\u2019s face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders. \u201cWe will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that no one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the dragons are always well guarded.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall be done, Khaleesi,\u201d Aggo said.\n\u201cWe have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished us to see,\u201d she went on. \u201cRakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take good men with you\u2014and women, to go places where men are forbidden.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, I do, blood of my blood,\u201d said Rakharo.\n\u201cSer Jorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been half a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps the gods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry us home.\u201d\nThe knight frowned. \u201cThat would be no kindness. The Usurper will kill you, sure as sunrise.\u201d Mormont hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt. \u201cMy place is here at your side.\u201d\n\u201cJhogo can guard me as well. You have more languages than my bloodriders, and the Dothraki mistrust the sea and those who sail her. Only you can serve me in this. Go among the ships and speak to the crews, learn where they are from and where they are bound and what manner of men command them.\u201d\nReluctantly, the exile nodded. \u201cAs you say, my queen.\u201d\nWhen all the men had gone, her handmaids stripped off the travel-stained silks she wore, and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico. The water was deliciously cool, and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle. It felt good to close her eyes and float, knowing she could rest as long as she liked. She wondered whether Aegon\u2019s Red Keep had a pool like this, and fragrant gardens full of lavender and mint. It must, surely. Viserys always said the Seven Kingdoms were more beautiful than any other place in the world.\nThe thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had lived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained, sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the horselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not rule them. Dany had no wish to reduce King\u2019s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped enough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children. I want my people to smile when they see me ride by, the way Viserys said they smiled for my father.\nBut before she could do that she must conquer.\nThe Usurper will kill you, sure as sunrise, Mormont had said. Robert had slain her gallant brother Rhaegar, and one of his creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son. They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle, a man who loved nothing better than war. And with him stood the great lords her brother had named the Usurper\u2019s dogs, cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart, and the golden Lannisters, father and son, so rich, so powerful, so treacherous.\nHow could she hope to overthrow such men? When Khal Drogo had lived, men trembled and made him gifts to stay his wrath. If they did not, he took their cities, wealth and wives and all. But his khalasar had been vast, while hers was meager. Her people had followed her across the red waste as she chased her comet, and would follow her across the poison water too, but they would not be enough. Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys had believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king\u2026 but Viserys had been a fool, and fools believe in foolish things.\nHer doubts made her shiver. Suddenly the water felt cold to her, and the little fish prickling at her skin annoying. Dany stood and climbed from the pool. \u201cIrri,\u201d she called, \u201cJhiqui.\u201d\nAs the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe, Dany\u2019s thoughts went to the three who had sought her out in the City of Bones. The Bleeding Star led me to Qarth for a purpose. Here I will find what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, and the wisdom to avoid the traps and snares. If the gods mean for me to conquer, they will provide, they will send me a sign, and if not\u2026 if not\u2026\nIt was near evenfall and Dany was feeding her dragons when Irri stepped through the silken curtains to tell her that Ser Jorah had returned from the docks\u2026 and not alone. \u201cSend him in, with whomever he has brought,\u201d she said, curious.\nWhen they entered, she was seated on a mound of cushions, her dragons all about her. The man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d the knight said, \u201cI bring you Quhuru Mo, captain of the Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town.\u201d\nThe black man knelt. \u201cI am greatly honored, my queen,\u201d he said; not in the tongue of the Summer Isles, which Dany did not know, but in the liquid Valyrian of the Nine Free Cities.\n\u201cThe honor is mine, Quhuru Mo,\u201d said Dany in the same language. \u201cHave you come from the Summer Isles?\u201d\n\u201cThis is so, Your Grace, but before, not half a year past, we called at Oldtown. From there I bring you a wondrous gift.\u201d\n\u201cA gift?\u201d\n\u201cA gift of news. Dragonmother, Stormborn, I tell you true, Robert Baratheon is dead.\u201d\nOutside her walls, dusk was settling over Qarth, but a sun had risen in Dany\u2019s heart. \u201cDead?\u201d she repeated. In her lap, black Drogon hissed, and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil. \u201cYou are certain? The Usurper is dead?\u201d\n\u201cSo it is said in Oldtown, and Dorne, and Lys, and all the other ports where we have called.\u201d\nHe sent me poisoned wine, yet I live and he is gone. \u201cWhat was the manner of his death?\u201d On her shoulder, pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream, stirring the air.\n\u201cTorn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood, or so I heard in Oldtown. Others say his queen betrayed him, or his brother, or Lord Stark who was his Hand. Yet all the tales agree in this: King Robert is dead and in his grave.\u201d\nDany had never looked upon the Usurper\u2019s face, yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him. His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth, when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place. And now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow.\n\u201cThe boy sits the Iron Throne now,\u201d Ser Jorah said.\n\u201cKing Joffrey reigns,\u201d Quhuru Mo agreed, \u201cbut the Lannisters rule. Robert\u2019s brothers have fled King\u2019s Landing. The talk is, they mean to claim the crown. And the Hand has fallen, Lord Stark who was King Robert\u2019s friend. He has been seized for treason.\u201d\n\u201cNed Stark a traitor?\u201d Ser Jorah snorted. \u201cNot bloody likely. The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat honor could he have?\u201d Dany said. \u201cHe was a traitor to his true king, as were these Lannisters.\u201d It pleased her to hear that the Usurper\u2019s dogs were fighting amongst themselves, though she was unsurprised. The same thing happened when her Drogo died, and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces. \u201cMy brother is dead as well, Viserys who was the true king,\u201d she told the Summer Islander. \u201cKhal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold.\u201d Would her brother have been any wiser, had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand?\n\u201cThen I grieve for you, Dragonmother, and for bleeding Westeros, bereft of its rightful king.\u201d\nBeneath Dany\u2019s gentle fingers, green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold. When his mouth opened, his teeth gleamed like black needles. \u201cWhen does your ship return to Westeros, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cNot for a year or more, I fear. From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east, to make the trader\u2019s circle round the Jade Sea.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Dany, disappointed. \u201cI wish you fair winds and good trading, then. You have brought me a precious gift.\u201d\n\u201cI have been amply repaid, great queen.\u201d\nShe puzzled at that. \u201cHow so?\u201d\nHis eyes gleamed. \u201cI have seen dragons.\u201d\nDany laughed. \u201cAnd will see more of them one day, I hope. Come to me in King\u2019s Landing when I am on my father\u2019s throne, and you shall have a great reward.\u201d\nThe Summer Islander promised he would do so, and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave. Jhiqui showed him out, while Ser Jorah Mormont remained.\n\u201cKhaleesi,\u201d the knight said when they were alone, \u201cI should not speak so freely of your plans, if I were you. This man will spread the tale wherever he goes now.\u201d\n\u201cLet him,\u201d she said. \u201cLet the whole world know my purpose. The Usurper is dead, what does it matter?\u201d\n\u201cNot every sailor\u2019s tale is true,\u201d Ser Jorah cautioned, \u201cand even if Robert be truly dead, his son rules in his place. This changes nothing, truly.\u201d\n\u201cThis changes everything.\u201d Dany rose abruptly. Screeching, her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings. Drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway. The others skittered across the floor, wingtips scrabbling on the marble. \u201cBefore, the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo\u2019s khalasar, a hundred thousand made as one by his strength. Now they fly to pieces, even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead.\u201d\n\u201cThe high lords have always fought. Tell me who\u2019s won and I\u2019ll tell you what it means. Khaleesi, the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches. You will need a fleet, gold, armies, alliances\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAll this I know.\u201d She took his hands in hers and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes. Sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect, and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed, but does he ever truly see me as his queen? \u201cI am not the frightened girl you met in Pentos. I have counted only fifteen name days, true\u2026 but I am as old as the crones in the dosh khaleen and as young as my dragons, Jorah. I have borne a child, burned a khal, and crossed the red waste and the Dothraki sea. Mine is the blood of the dragon.\u201d\n\u201cAs was your brother\u2019s,\u201d he said stubbornly.\n\u201cI am not Viserys.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThere is more of Rhaegar in you, I think, but even Rhaegar could be slain. Robert proved that on the Trident, with no more than a warhammer. Even dragons can die.\u201d\n\u201cDragons die.\u201d She stood on her toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek. \u201cBut so do dragonslayers.\u201d",

      "content": "Bran\nMeera moved in a wary circle, her net dangling loose in her left hand, the slender three-pronged frog spear poised in her right. Summer followed her with his golden eyes, turning, his tail held stiff and tall. Watching, watching\u2026\n\u201cYai!\u201d the girl shouted, the spear darting out. The wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear. Meera cast her net, the tangles unfolding in the air before her. Summer\u2019s leap carried him into it. He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward. Her spear went spinning away. The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an \u201cOof.\u201d The wolf crouched atop her.\nBran hooted. \u201cYou lose.\u201d\n\u201cShe wins,\u201d her brother Jojen said. \u201cSummer\u2019s snared.\u201d\nHe was right, Bran saw. Thrashing and growling at the net, trying to rip free, Summer was only ensnaring himself worse. Nor could he bite through. \u201cLet him out.\u201d\nLaughing, the Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both. Summer gave a piteous whine, his legs kicking against the cords that bound them. Meera knelt, undid a twist, pulled at a corner, tugged deftly here and there, and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free.\n\u201cSummer, to me.\u201d Bran spread his arms. \u201cWatch,\u201d he said, an instant before the wolf bowled into him. He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass. They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other, one snarling and yapping, the other laughing. In the end it was Bran sprawled on top, the mud-spattered direwolf under him. \u201cGood wolf,\u201d he panted. Summer licked him across the ear.\nMeera shook her head. \u201cDoes he never grow angry?\u201d\n\u201cNot with me.\u201d Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely, but it was all in play. \u201cSometimes he tears my garb but he\u2019s never drawn blood.\u201d\n\u201cYour blood, you mean. If he\u2019d gotten past my net\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt you. He knows I like you.\u201d All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast, but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran\u2019s constant companions. Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him \u201clittle grandfather,\u201d but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya. She wasn\u2019t scared to get dirty, and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy. She was older than Arya, though; almost sixteen, a woman grown. They were both older than Bran, even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone, but they never treated him like a child.\n\u201cI wish you were our wards instead of the Walders.\u201d He began to struggle toward the nearest tree. His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch, but when Meera moved to lift him he said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t help me.\u201d He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward, using the strength of his arms, until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash. \u201cSee, I told you.\u201d Summer lay down with his head in Bran\u2019s lap. \u201cI never knew anyone who fought with a net before,\u201d he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears. \u201cDid your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting?\u201d\n\u201cMy father taught me. We have no knights at Greywater. No master-at-arms, and no maester.\u201d\n\u201cWho keeps your ravens?\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cRavens can\u2019t find Greywater Watch, no more than our enemies can.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it moves,\u201d she told him.\nBran had never heard of a moving castle before. He looked at her uncertainly, but he couldn\u2019t tell whether she was teasing him or not. \u201cI wish I could see it. Do you think your lord father would let me come visit when the war is over?\u201d\n\u201cYou would be most welcome, my prince. Then or now.\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d Bran had spent his whole life at Winterfell. He yearned to see far places. \u201cI could ask Ser Rodrik when he returns.\u201d The old knight was off east, trying to set to rights the trouble there. Roose Bolton\u2019s bastard had started it by seizing Lady Hornwood as she returned from the harvest feast, marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be her son. Then Lord Manderly had taken her castle. To protect the Hornwood holdings from the Boltons, he had written, but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the bastard. \u201cSer Rodrik might let me go. Maester Luwin never would.\u201d\nSitting cross-legged under the weirwood, Jojen Reed regarded him solemnly. \u201cIt would be good if you left Winterfell, Bran.\u201d\n\u201cIt would?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother has the greensight,\u201d said Meera. \u201cHe dreams things that haven\u2019t happened, but sometimes they do.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no sometimes, Meera.\u201d A look passed between them; him sad, her defiant.\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bran said.\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Jojen, \u201cif you\u2019ll tell me about your dreams.\u201d\nThe godswood grew quiet. Bran could hear leaves rustling, and Hodor\u2019s distant splashing from the hot pools. He thought of the golden man and the three-eyed crow, remembered the crunch of bones between his jaws and the coppery taste of blood. \u201cI don\u2019t have dreams. Maester Luwin gives me sleeping draughts.\u201d\n\u201cDo they help?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\nMeera said, \u201cAll of Winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating, Bran. The women talk of it at the well, and the guards in their hall.\u201d\n\u201cTell us what frightens you so much,\u201d said Jojen.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to. Anyway, it\u2019s only dreams. Maester Luwin says dreams might mean anything or nothing.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother dreams as other boys do, and those dreams might mean anything,\u201d Meera said, \u201cbut the green dreams are different.\u201d\nJojen\u2019s eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else. Like now. \u201cI dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a green dream, so I knew it was true. A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.\u201d\n\u201cDid the crow have three eyes?\u201d\nJojen nodded.\nSummer raised his head from Bran\u2019s lap, and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden eyes.\n\u201cWhen I was little I almost died of greywater fever. That was when the crow came to me.\u201d\n\u201cHe came to me after I fell,\u201d Bran blurted. \u201cI was asleep for a long time. He said I had to fly or die, and I woke up, only I was broken and I couldn\u2019t fly after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou can if you want to.\u201d Picking up her net, Meera shook out the last tangles and began arranging it in loose folds.\n\u201cYou are the winged wolf, Bran,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure when we first came, but now I am. The crow sent us here to break your chains.\u201d\n\u201cIs the crow at Greywater?\u201d\n\u201cNo. The crow is in the north.\u201d\n\u201cAt the Wall?\u201d Bran had always wanted to see the Wall. His bastard brother Jon was there now, a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\n\u201cBeyond the Wall.\u201d Meera Reed hung the net from her belt. \u201cWhen Jojen told our lord father what he\u2019d dreamed, he sent us to Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cHow would I break the chains, Jojen?\u201d Bran asked.\n\u201cOpen your eye.\u201d\n\u201cThey are open Can\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cTwo are open.\u201d Jojen pointed. \u201cOne, two.\u201d\n\u201cI only have two.\u201d\n\u201cYou have three. The crow gave you the third, but you will not open it.\u201d He had a slow soft way of speaking. \u201cWith two eyes you see my face. With three you could see my heart. With two you can see that oak tree there. With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become. With two you see no farther than your walls. With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall.\u201d\nSummer got to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t need to see so far.\u201d Bran made a nervous smile. \u201cI\u2019m tired of talking about crows. Let\u2019s talk about wolves. Or lizard-lions. Have you ever hunted one, Meera? We don\u2019t have them here.\u201d\nMeera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes. \u201cThey live in the water. In slow streams and deep swamps\u2014\u201d\nHer brother interrupted. \u201cDid you dream of a lizard-lion?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Bran. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you dream of a wolf?\u201d\nHe was making Bran angry. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you my dreams. I\u2019m the prince. I\u2019m the Stark in Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cWas it Summer?\u201d\n\u201cYou be quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThe night of the harvest feast, you dreamed you were Summer in the godswood, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Bran shouted. Summer slid toward the weirwood, his white teeth bared.\nJojen Reed took no mind. \u201cWhen I touched Summer, I felt you in him. just as you are in him now.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have. I was in bed. I was sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cYou were in the godswood, all in grey.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a bad dream\u2026\u201d\nJojen stood. \u201cI felt you. I felt you fall. Is that what scares you, the falling?\u201d\nThe falling, Bran thought, and the golden man, the queen\u2019s brother, he scares me too, but mostly the falling. He did not say it, though. How could he? He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin, and he could not tell the Reeds either. If he didn\u2019t talk about it, maybe he would forget. He had never wanted to remember. It might not even be a true remembering.\n\u201cDo you fall every night, Bran?\u201d Joien asked quietly.\nA low rumbling growl rose from Summer\u2019s throat, and there was no play in it. He stalked forward, all teeth and hot eyes. Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother, spear in hand. \u201cKeep him back, Bran.\u201d\n\u201cJojen is making him angry.\u201d\nMeera shook out her net.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your anger, Bran,\u201d her brother said. \u201cYour fear.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a wolf.\u201d Yet he\u2019d howled with them in the night, and tasted blood in his wolf dreams.\n\u201cPart of you is Summer, and part of Summer is you. You know that, Bran.\u201d\nSummer rushed forward, but Meera blocked him, jabbing with the three-pronged spear. The wolf twisted aside, circling, stalking. Meera turned to face him. \u201cCall him back, Bran.\u201d\n\u201cSummer!\u201d Bran shouted. \u201cTo me, Summer!\u201d He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh. His hand tingled, though his dead leg felt nothing.\nThe direwolf lunged again, and again Meera\u2019s spear darted out. Summer dodged, circled back. The bushes rustled, and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood, teeth bared. The scent was strong; his brother had smelled his rage. Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck. Meera stood beside her brother, with wolves to either side. \u201cBran, call them off.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cJojen, up the tree.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need. Today is not the day I die.\u201d\n\u201cDo it!\u201d she screamed, and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood, using the face for his handholds. The direwolves closed. Meera abandoned spear and net, jumped up, and grabbed the branch above her head. Shaggy\u2019s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb. Summer sat back on his haunches and howled, while Shaggydog worried the net, shaking it in his teeth.\nOnly then did Bran remember that they were not alone. He cupped hands around his mouth. \u201cHodor!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHodor! Hodor!\u201d He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt Hodor,\u201d he assured his treed friends.\nA few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming. Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools, but Bran had never been so glad to see him. \u201cHodor, help me. Chase off the wolves. Chase them off.\u201d\nHodor went to it gleefully, waving his arms and stamping his huge feet, shouting \u201cHodor, Hodor,\u201d running first at one wolf and then the other. Shaggydog was the first to flee, slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl. When Summer had enough, he came back to Bran and lay down beside him.\nNo sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again. Jojen never took his eyes off Summer. \u201cWe will talk again,\u201d he promised Bran.\nIt was the wolves, it wasn\u2019t me. He did not understand why they\u2019d gotten so wild. Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood. \u201cHodor,\u201d he said, \u201cbring me to Maester Luwin.\u201d\nThe maester\u2019s turret below the rookery was one of Bran\u2019s favorite places. Luwin was hopelessly untidy, but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to Bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes. He liked the ravens too.\nHe found Luwin perched on a high stool, writing. With Ser Rodrik gone, all of the governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders. \u201cMy prince,\u201d he said when Hodor entered, \u201cyou\u2019re early for lessons today.\u201d The maester spent several hours every afternoon tutoring Bran, Rickon, and the Walder Freys.\n\u201cHodor, stand still.\u201d Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull himself up and out of the basket. He hung for a moment by his arms until Hodor carried him to a chair. \u201cMeera says her brother has the greensight.\u201d\nMaester Luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill. \u201cDoes she now?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYou told me that the children of the forest had the greensight. I remember.\u201d\n\u201cSome claimed to have that power. Their wise men were called greenseers.\u201d\n\u201cWas it magic?\u201d\n\u201cCall it that for want of a better word, if you must. At heart it was only a different sort of knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\nLuwin set down his quill. \u201cNo one truly knows, Bran. The children are gone from the world, and their wisdom with them. It had to do with the faces in the trees, we think. The First Men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods. That was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children. Supposedly the greenseers also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees. Even fish. Does the Reed boy claim such powers?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think. But he has dreams that come true sometimes, Meera says.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us have dreams that come true sometimes. You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew he was dead, remember?\u201d\n\u201cRickon did too. We dreamed the same dream.\u201d\n\u201cCall it greensight, if you wish\u2026 but remember as well all those tens of thousands of dreams that you and Rickon have dreamed that did not come true. Do you perchance recall what I taught you about the chain collar that every maester wears?\u201d\nBran thought for a moment, trying to remember. \u201cA maester forges his chain in the Citadel of Oldtown. It\u2019s a chain because you swear to serve, and it\u2019s made of different metals because you serve the realm and the realm has different sorts of people. Every time you learn something you get another link. Black iron is for ravenry, silver for healing, gold for sums and numbers. I don\u2019t remember them all.\u201d\nLuwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it, inch by inch. He had a thick neck for a small man, and the chain was tight, but a few pulls had it all the way around. \u201cThis is Valyrian steel,\u201d he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat. \u201cOnly one maester in a hundred wears such a link. This signifies that I have studied what the Citadel calls the higher mysteries\u2014magic, for want of a better word. A fascinating pursuit, but of small use, which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it.\n\u201cAll those who study the higher mysteries try their own hand at spells, soon or late. I yielded to the temptation too, I must confess it. Well, I was a boy, and what boy does not secretly wish to find hidden powers in himself? I got no more for my efforts than a thousand boys before me, and a thousand since. Sad to say, magic does not work.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it does,\u201d Bran protested. \u201cI had that dream, and Rickon did too. And there are mages and warlocks in the east\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere are men who call themselves mages and warlocks,\u201d Maester Luwin said. \u201cI had a friend at the Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear, but he was no more magical than I was. Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so they seem\u2026 but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea. Even gods die, we think. Everything changes.\n\u201cPerhaps magic was once a mighty force in the world, but no longer. What little remains is no more than the wisp of smoke that lingers in the air after a great fire has burned out, and even that is fading. Valyria was the last ember, and Valyria is gone. The dragons are no more, the giants are dead, the children of the forest forgotten with all their lore.\n\u201cNo, my prince. Jojen Reed may have had a dream or two that he believes came true, but he does not have the greensight. No living man has that power.\u201d\nBran said as much to Meera Reed when she came to him at dusk as he sat in his window seat watching the lights flicker to life. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened with the wolves. Summer shouldn\u2019t have tried to hurt Jojen, but Jojen shouldn\u2019t have said all that about my dreams. The crow lied when he said I could fly, and your brother lied too.\u201d\n\u201cOr perhaps your maester is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t. Even my father relied on his counsel.\u201d\n\u201cYour father listened, I have no doubt. But in the end, he decided for himself. Bran, will you let me tell you about a dream Jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers?\u201d\n\u201cThe Walders aren\u2019t my brothers.\u201d\nShe paid that no heed. \u201cYou were sitting at supper, but instead of a servant, Maester Luwin brought you your food. He served you the king\u2019s cut off the roast, the meat rare and bloody, but with a savory smell that made everyone\u2019s mouth water. The meat he served the Freys was old and grey and dead. Yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou will, my brother says. When you do, we\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\nBran was almost afraid to sit to supper that night, but when he did, it was pigeon pie they set before him. Everyone else was served the same, and he couldn\u2019t see that anything was wrong with the food they served the Walders. Maester Luwin has the truth of it, he told himself. Nothing bad was coming to Winterfell, no matter what Jojen said. Bran was relieved\u2026 but disappointed too. So long as there was magic, anything could happen. Ghosts could walk, trees could talk, and broken boys could grow up to be knights. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t,\u201d he said aloud in the darkness of his bed. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic, and the stories are just stories.\u201d\nAnd he would never walk, nor fly, nor be a knight.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThe rushes were scratchy under the soles of his bare feet. \u201cMy cousin chooses a queer hour to come visiting,\u201d Tyrion told a sleep-befuddled Podrick Payne, who\u2019d doubtless expected to be well roasted for waking him. \u201cSee him to my solar and tell him I\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d\nIt was well past midnight, he judged from the black outside the window. Does Lancel think to find me drowsy and slow of wit at this hour? he wondered. No, Lancel scarce thinks at all, this is Cersei\u2019s doing. His sister would be disappointed. Even abed, he worked well into the morning\u2014reading by the flickering light of a candle, scrutinizing the reports of Varys\u2019s whisperers, and poring over Littlefinger\u2019s books of accounts until the columns blurred and his eyes ached.\nHe splashed some tepid water on his face from the basin beside his bed and took his time squatting in the garderobe, the night air cold on his bare skin. Ser Lancel was sixteen, and not known for his patience. Let him wait, and grow more anxious in the waiting. When his bowels were empty, Tyrion slipped on a bedrobe and roughed his thin flaxen hair with his fingers, all the more to look as if he had wakened from sleep.\nLancel was pacing before the ashes of the hearth, garbed in slashed red velvet with black silk undersleeves, a jeweled dagger and a gilded scabbard hanging from his swordbelt. \u201cCousin,\u201d Tyrion greeted him. \u201cYour visits are too few. To what do I owe this undeserved pleasure?\u201d\n\u201cHer Grace the Queen Regent has sent me to command you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.\u201d Ser Lancel showed Tyrion a crimson ribbon, bearing Cersei\u2019s lion seal impressed in golden wax. \u201cHere is her warrant.\u201d\n\u201cSo it is.\u201d Tyrion waved it away. \u201cI hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength, so soon after her illness. it would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse.\u201d\n\u201cHer Grace is quite recovered,\u201d Ser Lancel said curtly.\n\u201cMusic to my ears.\u201d Though not a tune I\u2019m fond of. I should have given her a larger dose. Tyrion had hoped for a few more days without Cersei\u2019s interference, but he was not too terribly surprised by her return to health. She was Jaime\u2019s twin, after all. He made himself smile pleasantly. \u201cPod, build us a fire, the air is too chilly for my taste. Will you take a cup with me, Lancel? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI need no help sleeping,\u201d Ser Lancel said. \u201cI am come at Her Grace\u2019s behest, not to drink with you, Imp.\u201d\nKnighthood had made the boy bolder, Tyrion reflected\u2014that, and the sorry part he had played in murdering King Robert. \u201cWine does have its dangers.\u201d He smiled as he poured. \u201cAs to Grand Maester Pycelle\u2026 if my sweet sister is so concerned for him, I would have thought she\u2019d come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?\u201d\n\u201cMake of it what you will, so long as you release your prisoner. The Grand Maester is a staunch friend to the Queen Regent, and under her personal protection.\u201d A hint of a sneer played about the lad\u2019s lips; he was enjoying this. He takes his lessons from Cersei. \u201cHer Grace will never consent to this outrage. She reminds you that she is Joffrey\u2019s regent.\u201d\n\u201cAs I am Joffrey\u2019s Hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe Hand serves,\u201d the young knight informed him airily. \u201cThe regent rules until the king is of age.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you ought write that down so I\u2019ll remember it better.\u201d The fire was crackling merrily. \u201cYou may leave us, Pod,\u201d Tyrion told his squire. Only when the boy was gone did he turn back to Lancel. \u201cThere is more?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Her Grace bids me inform you that Ser Jacelyn Bywater defied a command issued in the king\u2019s own name.\u201d\nWhich means that Cersei has already ordered Bywater to release Pycelle, and been rebuffed. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cShe insists that the man be removed from his office and placed under arrest for treason. I warn you\u2014\u201d\nHe set aside his wine cup. \u201cI\u2019ll hear no warnings from you, boy.\u201d\n\u201cSer,\u201d Lancel said stiffly. He touched his sword, perhaps to remind Tyrion that he wore one. \u201cHave a care how you speak to me, Imp.\u201d Doubtless he meant to sound threatening, but that absurd wisp of a mustache ruined the effect.\n\u201cOh, unhand your sword. One cry from me and Shagga will burst in and kill you. With an axe, not a wineskin.\u201d\nLancel reddened; was he such a fool as to believe his part in Robert\u2019s death had gone unnoted? \u201cI am a knight\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve noted. Tell me\u2014did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?\u201d\nThe flicker in Lancel\u2019s green eyes was all the admission Tyrion needed. So Varys told it true. Well, no one can ever claim that my sister does not love her family. \u201cWhat, nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?\u201d\n\u201cYou will withdraw these filthy accusations or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Have you given any thought to what Joffrey will do when I tell him you murdered his father to bed his mother?\u201d\n\u201cIt was not like that!\u201d Lancel protested, horrified.\n\u201cNo? What was it like, pray?\u201d\n\u201cThe queen gave me the strongwine! Your own father Lord Tywin, when I was named the king\u2019s squire, he told me to obey her in everything.\u201d\n\u201cDid he tell you to fuck her too?\u201d Look at him. Not quite so tall, his features not so fine, and his hair is sand instead of spun gold, yet still\u2026 even a poor copy of Jaime is sweeter than an empty bed, I suppose. \u201cNo, I thought not.\u201d\n\u201cI never meant\u2026 I only did as I was bid, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026hated every instant of it, is that what you would have me believe? A high place at court, knighthood, my sister\u2019s legs opening for you at night, oh, yes, it must have been terrible for you.\u201d Tyrion pushed himself to his feet. \u201cWait here. His Grace will want to hear this.\u201d\nThe defiance went from Lancel all at once. The young knight fell to his knees a frightened boy. \u201cMercy, my lord, I beg you.\u201d\n\u201cSave it for Joffrey. He likes a good beg.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord, it was your sister\u2019s bidding, the queen, as you said, but His Grace\u2026 he\u2019d never understand\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWould you have me keep the truth from the king?\u201d\n\u201cFor my father\u2019s sake! I\u2019ll leave the city, it will be as if it never happened! I swear, I will end it\u2026\u201d\nIt was hard not to laugh. \u201cI think not.\u201d\nNow the lad looked lost. \u201cMy lord?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. My father told you to obey my sister? Very well, obey her. Stay close to her side, keep her trust, pleasure her as often as she requires it. No one need ever know\u2026 so long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing. Where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, what plans she is hatching. All. And you will be the one to tell me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Lancel spoke without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Tyrion liked that. \u201cI will. I swear it. As you command.\u201d\n\u201cRise.\u201d Tyrion filled the second cup and pressed it on him. \u201cDrink to our understanding. I promise, there are no boars in the castle that I know of.\u201d Lancel lifted the cup and drank, albeit stiffly. \u201cSmile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it\u2019s all for the good of the realm. You could do well out of this. Knighthood is nothing. If you\u2019re clever, you\u2019ll have a lordship from me before you\u2019re done.\u201d Tyrion swirled the wine in his cup. \u201cWe want Cersei to have every faith in you. Go back and tell her I beg her forgiveness. Tell her that you frightened me, that I want no conflict between us, that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 her demands\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll give her Pycelle.\u201d\n\u201cYou will?\u201d Lancel seemed astonished.\nTyrion smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll release him on the morrow. I could swear that I hadn\u2019t harmed a hair on his head, but it wouldn\u2019t be strictly true. In any case, he\u2019s well enough, though I won\u2019t vouch for his vigor. The black cells are not a healthy place for a man his age. Cersei can keep him as a pet or send him to the Wall, I don\u2019t care which, but I won\u2019t have him on the council.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Ser Jacelyn?\u201d\n\u201cTell my sister you believe you can win him away from me, given time. That ought to content her for a while.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d Lancel finished his wine.\n\u201cOne last thing. With King Robert dead, it would be most embarrassing should his grieving widow suddenly grow great with child.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord, I\u2026 we\u2026 the queen has commanded me not to\u2026\u201d His ears had turned Lannister crimson. \u201cI spill my seed on her belly, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cA lovely belly, I have no doubt. Moisten it as often as you wish\u2026 but see that your dew falls nowhere else. I want no more nephews, is that clear?\u201d\nSer Lancel made a stiff bow and took his leave.\nTyrion allowed himself a moment to feel sorry for the boy. Another fool, and a weakling as well, but he does not deserve what Cersei and I are doing to him. It was a kindness that his uncle Kevan had two other sons; this one was unlikely to live out the year. Cersei would have him killed out of hand if she learned he was betraying her, and if by some grace of the gods she did not, Lancel would never survive the day Jaime Lannister returned to King\u2019s Landing. The only question would be whether Jaime cut him down in a jealous rage, or Cersei murdered him first to keep Jaime from finding out. Tyrion\u2019s silver was on Cersei.\nA restlessness was on him, and Tyrion knew full well he would not get back to sleep tonight. Not here, in any case. He found Podrick Payne asleep in a chair outside the door of the solar, and shook him by the shoulder. \u201cSummon Bronn, and then run down to the stables and have two horses saddled.\u201d\nThe squire\u2019s eyes were cloudy with sleep. \u201cHorses.\u201d\n\u201cThose big brown animals that love apples, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen them. Four legs and a tail. But Bronn first.\u201d\nThe sellsword was not long in appearing. \u201cWho pissed in your soup?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cCersei, as ever. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to the taste by now, but never mind. My gentle sister seems to have mistaken me for Ned Stark.\u201d\n\u201cI hear he was taller.\u201d\n\u201cNot after Joff took off his head. You ought to have dressed more warmly, the night is chill.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cAre all sellswords as clever as you?\u201d\nThe city streets were dangerous, but with Bronn beside him Tyrion felt safe enough. The guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall, and they rode down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon\u2019s High Hill, and thence onto Pigrun Alley, past rows of shuttered windows and tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street they almost kissed. The moon seemed to follow them as they went, playing peek-and-sneak among the chimneys. They encountered no one but a lone old crone, carrying a dead cat by the tail. She gave them a fearful look, as if she were afraid they might try to steal her dinner, and slunk off into the shadows without a word.\nTyrion reflected on the men who had been Hand before him, who had proved no match for his sister\u2019s wiles. How could they be? Men like that\u2026 too honest to live, too noble to shit, Cersei devours such fools every morning when she breaks her fast. The only way to defeat my sister is to play her own game, and that was something the Lords Stark and Arryn would never do. Small wonder that both of them were dead, while Tyrion Lannister had never felt more alive. His stunted legs might make him a comic grotesque at a harvest ball, but this dance he knew.\nDespite the hour, the brothel was crowded. Chataya greeted them pleasantly and escorted them to the common room. Bronn went upstairs with a dark-eyed girl from Dorne, but Alayaya was busy entertaining. \u201cShe will be so pleased to know you\u2019ve come,\u201d said Chataya. \u201cI will see that the turret room is made ready for you. Will my lord take a cup of wine while he waits?\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d he said.\nThe wine was poor stuff compared to the vintages from the Arbor the house normally served. \u201cYou must forgive us, my lord,\u201d Chataya said. \u201cI cannot find good wine at any price of late.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not alone in that, I fear.\u201d\nChataya commiserated with him a moment, then excused herself and glided off. A handsome woman, Tyrion reflected as he watched her go. He had seldom seen such elegance and dignity in a whore. Though to be sure, she saw herself more as a kind of priestess. Perhaps that is the secret. It is not what we do, so much as why we do it. Somehow that thought comforted him.\nA few of the other patrons were giving him sideways looks. The last time he ventured out, a man had spit on him\u2026 well, had tried to. Instead he\u2019d spit on Bronn, and in future would do his spitting without teeth.\n\u201cIs milord feeling unloved?\u201d Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. \u201cI have a cure for that.\u201d\nSmiling, Tyrion shook his head. \u201cYou are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I\u2019ve grown fond of Alayaya\u2019s remedy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but \u2019Yaya. She\u2019s good but I\u2019m better, don\u2019t you want to see?\u201d\n\u201cNext time, perhaps.\u201d Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.\nGiggling, she put her hand between his thighs and squeezed him through his breeches. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to wait till next time,\u201d she announced. \u201cHe wants to come out and count all my freckles, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDancy.\u201d Alayaya stood in the doorway, dark and cool in gauzy green silk. \u201cHis lordship is come to visit me.\u201d\nTyrion gently disentangled himself from the other girl and stood. Dancy did not seem to mind. \u201cNext time,\u201d she reminded him. She put a finger in her mouth and sucked it.\nAs the black-skinned girl led him up the stairs, she said, \u201cPoor Dancy. She has a fortnight to get my lord to choose her. Elsewise she loses her black pearls to Marei.\u201d\nMarei was a cool, pale, delicate girl Tyrion had noticed once or twice. Green eyes and porcelain skin, long straight silvery hair, very lovely, but too solemn by half. \u201cI\u2019d hate to have the poor child lose her pearls on account of me.\u201d\n\u201cThen take her upstairs next time.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cI think not, my lord.\u201d\nShe\u2019s right, Tyrion thought, I won\u2019t. Shae may be only a whore, but I am faithful to her after my fashion.\nIn the turret room, as he opened the door of the wardrobe, he looked at Alayaya curiously. \u201cWhat do you do while I\u2019m gone?\u201d\nShe raised her arms and stretched like some sleek black cat. \u201cSleep. I am much better rested since you began to visit us, my lord. And Marei is teaching us to read, perhaps soon I will be able to pass the time with a book.\u201d\n\u201cSleep is good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd books are better.\u201d He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. Then it was down the shaft and through the tunnel.\nAs he left the stable on his piebald gelding, Tyrion heard the sound of music drifting over the rooftops. It was pleasant to think that men still sang, even in the midst of butchery and famine. Remembered notes filled his head, and for a moment he could almost hear Tysha as she\u2019d sung to him half a lifetime ago. He reined up to listen. The tune was wrong, the words too faint to hear. A different song then, and why not? His sweet innocent Tysha had been a lie start to finish, only a whore his brother Jaime had hired to make him a man.\nI\u2019m free of Tysha now, he thought. She\u2019s haunted me half my life, but I don\u2019t need her anymore, no more than I need Alayaya or Dancy or Marei, or the hundreds like them I\u2019ve bedded with over the years. I have Shae now. Shae.\nThe gates of the manse were closed and barred. Tyrion pounded until the ornate bronze eye clacked open. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d The man who admitted him was one of Varys\u2019s prettier finds, a Braavosi daggerman with a harelip and a lazy eye. Tyrion had wanted no handsome young guardsmen loitering about Shae day after day. \u201cFind me old, ugly, scarred men, preferably impotent,\u201d he had told the eunuch. \u201cMen who prefer boys. Or men who prefer sheep, for that matter.\u201d Varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers, but he did find a eunuch strangler and a pair of foulsmelling Ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each other. The others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon, each uglier than the last. When Varys had paraded them before him, Tyrion had been afraid he\u2019d gone too far, but Shae had never uttered a word of complaint. And why would she? She has never complained of me, and I\u2019m more hideous than all her guards together. Perhaps she does not even see ugliness.\nEven so, Tyrion would sooner have used some of his mountain clansmen to guard the manse; Chella\u2019s Black Ears perhaps, or the Moon Brothers. He had more faith in their iron loyalties and sense of honor than in the greed of sellswords. The risk was too great, however. All King\u2019s Landing knew the wildlings were his. If he sent the Black Ears here, it would only be a matter of time until the whole city knew the King\u2019s Hand was keeping a concubine.\nOne of the Ibbenese took his horse. \u201cHave you woken her?\u201d Tyrion asked him.\n\u201cNo, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nThe fire in the bedchamber had burned down to embers, but the room was still warm. Shae had kicked off her blankets and sheets as she slept. She lay nude atop the featherbed, the soft curves of her young body limned in the faint glow from the hearth. Tyrion stood in the door and drank in the sight of her. Younger than Marei, sweeter than Dancy, more beautiful than Alayaya, she\u2019s all I need and more. How could a whore look so clean and sweet and innocent, he wondered?\nHe had not intended to disturb her, but the sight of her was enough to make him hard. He let his garments fall to the floor, then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart and kissed her between the thighs. Shae murmured in her sleep. He kissed her again, and licked at her secret sweetness, on and on until his beard and her cunt were both soaked. When she gave a soft moan and shuddered, he climbed up and thrust himself inside her and exploded almost at once.\nHer eyes were open. She smiled and stroked his head and whispered, \u201cI just had the sweetest dream, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nTyrion nipped at her small hard nipple and nestled his head on her shoulder. He did not pull out of her; would that he never had to pull out of her. \u201cThis is no dream,\u201d he promised her. It is real, all of it, he thought, the wars, the intrigues, the great bloody game, and me in the center of it\u2026 me, the dwarf, the monster, the one they scorned and laughed at, but now I hold it all, the power, the city, the girl. This was what I was made for, and gods forgive me, but I do love it\u2026\nAnd her. And her.",

      "content": "Arya\nWhatever names Harren the Black had meant to give his towers were long forgotten. They were called the Tower of Dread, the Widow\u2019s Tower, the Wailing Tower, the Tower of Ghosts, and Kingspyre Tower. Arya slept in a shallow niche in the cavernous vaults beneath the Wailing Tower, on a bed of straw. She had water to wash in whenever she liked, a chunk of soap. The work was hard, but no harder than walking miles every day. Weasel did not need to find worms and bugs to eat, as Arry had; there was bread every day, and barley stews with bits of carrot and turnip, and once a fortnight even a bite of meat.\nHot Pie ate even better; he was where he belonged, in the kitchens, a round stone building with a domed roof that was a world unto itself. Arya took her meals at a trestle table in the undercroft with Weese and his other charges, but sometimes she would be chosen to help fetch their food, and she and Hot Pie could steal a moment to talk. He could never remember that she was now Weasel and kept calling her Arry, even though he knew she was a girl. Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart, but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw. They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon.\nGendry had been sent to the forge; Arya seldom saw him. As for those she served with, she did not even want to know their names. That only made it hurt worse when they died. Most of them were older than she was and content to let her alone.\nHarrenhal was vast, much of it far gone in decay. Lady Whent had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but she\u2019d used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled, and the small household she\u2019d left could not begin to tend the needs of all the knights, lords, and highborn prisoners Lord Tywin had brought, so the Lannisters must forage for servants as well as for plunder and provender. The talk was that Lord Tywin planned to restore Harrenhal to glory, and make it his new seat once the war was done.\nWeese used Arya to run messages, draw water, and fetch food, and sometimes to serve at table in the Barracks Hall above the armory, where the men-at-arms took their meals. But most of her work was cleaning. The ground floor of the Wailing Tower was given over to storerooms and granaries, and two floors above housed part of the garrison, but the upper stories had not been occupied for eighty years. Now Lord Tywin had commanded that they be made fit for habitation again. There were floors to be scrubbed, grime to be washed off windows, broken chairs and rotted beds to be carried off. The topmost story was infested with nests of the huge black bats that House Whent had used for its sigil, and there were rats in the cellars as well\u2026 and ghosts, some said, the spirits of Harren the Black and his sons.\nArya thought that was stupid. Harren and his sons had died in Kingspyre Tower, that was why it had that name, so why should they cross the yard to haunt her? The Wailing Tower only wailed when the wind blew from the north, and that was just the sound the air made blowing through the cracks in the stones where they had fissured from the heat. if there were ghosts in Harrenhal, they never troubled her. It was the living men she feared, Weese and Ser Gregor Clegane and Lord Tywin Lannister himself, who kept his apartments in Kingspyre Tower, still the tallest and mightiest of all, though lopsided beneath the weight of the slagged stone that made it look like some giant half-melted black candle.\nShe wondered what Lord Tywin would do if she marched up to him and confessed to being Arya Stark, but she knew she\u2019d never get near enough to talk to him, and anyhow he\u2019d never believe her if she did, and afterward Weese would beat her bloody.\nIn his own small strutting way, Weese was nearly as scary as Ser Gregor. The Mountain swatted men like flies, but most of the time he did not even seem to know the fly was there. Weese always knew you were there, and what you were doing, and sometimes what you were thinking. He would hit at the slightest provocation, and he had a dog who was near as bad as he was, an ugly spotted bitch that smelled worse than any dog Arya had ever known. Once she saw him set the dog on a latrine boy who\u2019d annoyed him. She tore a big chunk out of the boy\u2019s calf while Weese laughed.\nIt took him only three days to earn the place of honor in her nightly prayers. \u201cWeese,\u201d she would whisper, first of all. \u201cDunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\u201d If she let herself forget even one of them, how would she ever find him again to kill him?\nOn the road Arya had felt like a sheep, but Harrenbal turned her into a mouse. She was grey as a mouse in her scratchy wool shift, and like a mouse she kept to the crannies and crevices and dark holes of the castle, scurrying out of the way of the mighty.\nSometimes she thought they were all mice within those thick walls, even the knights and the great lords. The size of the castle made even Gregor Clegane seem small. Harrenhal covered thrice as much ground as Winterfell, and its buildings were so much larger they could scarcely be compared. Its stables housed a thousand horses, its godswood covered twenty acres, its kitchens were as large as Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall, and its own great hall, grandly named the Hall of a Hundred Hearths even though it only had thirty and some (Arya had tried to count them, twice, but she came up with thirty-three once and thirty-five the other time) was so cavernous that Lord Tywin could have feasted his entire host, though he never did. Walls, doors, halls, steps, everything was built to an inhuman scale that made Arya remember the stories Old Nan used to tell of the giants who lived beyond the Wall.\nAnd as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under their feet, Arya heard all sorts of secrets just by keeping her ears open as she went about her duties. Pretty Pia from the buttery was a slut who was working her way through every knight in the castle. The wife of the gaoler was with child, but the real father was either Ser Alyn Stackspear or a singer called Whitesmile Wat. Lord Lefford made mock of ghosts at table, but always kept a candle burning by his bed. Ser Dunaver\u2019s squire Jodge could not hold his water when he slept. The cooks despised Ser Harys Swyft and spit in all his food. once she even overheard Maester Tothmure\u2019s serving girl confiding to her brother about some message that said Joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all. \u201cLord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak such filth again,\u201d the girl whispered.\nKing Robert\u2019s brothers Stannis and Renly had joined the fighting, she heard. \u201cAnd both of them kings now,\u201d Weese said. \u201cRealm\u2019s got more kings than a castle\u2019s got rats.\u201d Even Lannister men questioned how long Joffrey would hold the Iron Throne. \u201cThe lad\u2019s got no army but them gold cloaks, and he\u2019s ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf, and a woman,\u201d she heard a lordling mutter in his cups. \u201cWhat good will the likes of them be if it comes to battle?\u201d There was always talk of Beric Dondarrion. A fat archer once said the Bloody Mummers had slain him, but the others only laughed. \u201cLorch killed the man at Rushing Falls, and the Mountain\u2019s slain him twice. Got me a silver stag says he don\u2019t stay dead this time neither.\u201d\nArya did not know who Bloody Mummers were until a fortnight later, when the queerest company of men she\u2019d ever seen arrived at Harrenhal. Beneath the standard of a black goat with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in their braids; lancers astride striped black-and-white horses; bowmen with powdered cheeks; squat hairy men with shaggy shields; brown-skinned men in feathered cloaks; a wispy fool in green-and-pink motley; swordsmen with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver; spearmen with colored scars that covered their cheeks; a slender man in septon\u2019s robes, a fatherly one in maester\u2019s grey, and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair.\nAt their head was a man stick-thin and very tall, with a drawn emaciated face made even longer by the ropy black beard that grew from his pointed chin nearly to his waist. The helm that hung from his saddle horn was black steel, fashioned in the shape of a goat\u2019s head. About his neck he wore a chain made of linked coins of many different sizes, shapes, and metals, and his horse was one of the strange black-and-white ones.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know that lot, Weasel,\u201d Weese said when he saw her looking at the goat-helmed man. Two of his drinking friends were with him, men-at-arms in service to Lord Lefford.\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d she asked.\nOne of the soldiers laughed. \u201cThe Footmen, girl. Toes of the Goat. Lord Tywin\u2019s Bloody Mummers.\u201d\n\u201cPease for wits. You get her flayed, you can scrub the bloody steps,\u201d said Weese. \u201cThey\u2019re sellswords, Weasel girl. Call themselves the Brave Companions. Don\u2019t use them other names where they can hear, or they\u2019ll hurt you bad. The goat-helm\u2019s their captain, Lord Vargo Hoat.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s no fucking lord,\u201d said the second soldier. \u201cI heard Ser Amory say so. He\u2019s just some sellsword with a mouth full of slobber and a high opinion of hisself.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Weese, \u201cbut she better call him lord if she wants to keep all her parts.\u201d\nArya looked at Vargo Hoat again. How many monsters does Lord Tywin have?\nThe Brave Companions were housed in the Widow\u2019s Tower, so Arya need not serve them. She was glad of that; on the very night they arrived, fighting broke out between the sellswords and some Lannister men. Ser Harys Swyft\u2019s squire was stabbed to death and two of the Bloody Mummers were wounded. The next morning Lord Tywin hanged them both from the gatehouse walls, along with one of Lord Lydden\u2019s archers. Weese said the archer had started all the trouble by taunting the sellswords over Beric Dondarrion. After the hanged men had stopped kicking, Vargo Hoat and Ser Harys embraced and kissed and swore to love each other always as Lord Tywin looked on. Arya thought it was funny the way Vargo Hoat lisped and slobbered, but she knew better than to laugh.\nThe Bloody Mummers did not linger long at Harrenhal, but before they rode out again, Arya heard one of them saying how a northern army under Roose Bolton had occupied the ruby ford of the Trident. \u201cIf he crosses, Lord Tywin will smash him again like he did on the Green Fork,\u201d a Lannister bowmen said, but his fellows jeered him down. \u201cBolton\u2019ll never cross, not till the Young Wolf marches from Riverrun with his wild northmen and all them wolves.\u201d\nArya had not known her brother was so near. Riverrun was much closer than Winterfell, though she was not certain where it lay in relation to Harrenhal. I could find out somehow, I know I could, if only I could get away. When she thought of seeing Robb\u2019s face again Arya had to bite her lip. And I want to see Jon too, and Bran and Rickon, and Mother. Even Sansa\u2026 I\u2019ll kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady, she\u2019ll like that.\nFrom the courtyard talk she\u2019d learned that the upper chambers of the Tower of Dread housed three dozen captives taken during some battle on the Green Fork of the Trident. Most had been given freedom of the castle in return for their pledge not to attempt escape. They vowed not to escape, Arya told herself, but they never swore not to help me escape.\nThe captives ate at their own table in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths, and could often be seen about the grounds. Four brothers took their exercise together every day, fighting with staves and wooden shields in the Flowstone Yard. Three of them were Freys of the Crossing, the fourth their bastard brother. They were only there a short time, though; one morning two other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold, and ransomed them from the knights who\u2019d captured them. The six Freys all left together.\nNo one ransomed the northmen, though. One fat lordling haunted the kitchens, Hot Pie told her, always looking for a morsel. His mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth, and the clasp that held his cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident. He belonged to Lord Tywin, but the fierce, bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off him. Sansa would have known who he was, and the fat one too, but Arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils. Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house, she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done.\nShe did remember Lord Cerwyn, though. His lands had been close to Winterfell, so he and his son Cley had often visited. Yet as fate would have it, he was the only captive who was never seen; he was abed in a tower cell, recovering from a wound. For days and days Arya tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him. If he knew her, he would be honor bound to help her. A lord would have gold for a certainty, they all did; perhaps he would pay some of Lord Tywin\u2019s own sellswords to take her to Riverrun. Father had always said that most sellswords would betray anyone for enough gold.\nThen one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon. The body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk, decorated with a battle-axe sigil. When Arya asked who it was, one of the guards told her that Lord Cerwyn had died. The words felt like a kick in the belly. He could never have helped you anyway, she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate. He couldn\u2019t even help himself, you stupid mouse.\nAfter that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors. Lord Tywin would soon march on Riverrun, she heard. or he would drive south to Highgarden, no one would ever expect that. No, he must defend King\u2019s Landing, Stannis was the greatest threat. He\u2019d sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger from his back. He\u2019d sent ravens to the Eyrie, he meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win the Vale. He\u2019d bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the Stark wargs. He was writing Lady Stark to make a peace, the Kingslayer would soon be freed.\nThough ravens came and went every day, Lord Tywin himself spent most of his days behind closed doors with his war council. Arya caught glimpses of him, but always from afar\u2014once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache, once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments, but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below. He stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword. They said Lord Tywin loved gold most of all; he even shit gold, she heard one squire jest. The Lannister lord was strong-looking for an old man, with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head. There was something in his face that reminded Arya of her own father, even though they looked nothing alike. He has a lord\u2019s face, that\u2019s all, she told herself. She remembered hearing her lady mother tell Father to put on his lord\u2019s face and go deal with some matter. Father had laughed at that. She could not imagine Lord Tywin ever laughing at anything.\nOne afternoon, while she was waiting her turn to draw a pail of water from the well, she heard the hinges of the east gate groaning. A party of men rode under the portcullis at a walk. When she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader, a stab of hate shot through her.\nIn the light of day, Ser Amory Lorch looked less frightening than he had by torchlight, but he still had the pig\u2019s eyes she recalled. One of the women said that his men had ridden all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and slaying rebels. We weren\u2019t rebels, Arya thought. We were the Night\u2019s Watch; the Night\u2019s Watch takes no side. Ser Amory had fewer men than she remembered, though, and many wounded. I hope their wounds fester. I hope they all die.\nThen she saw the three near the end of the column.\nRorge had donned a black halfhelm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that he did not have a nose. Biter rode ponderously beside him on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under his weight. Half-healed burns covered his body, making him even more hideous than before.\nBut Jaqen H\u2019ghar still smiled. His garb was still ragged and filthy, but he had found time to wash and brush his hair. It streamed down across his shoulders, red and white and shiny, and Arya heard the girls giggling to each other in admiration.\nI should have let the fire have them. Gendry said to, I should have listened. If she hadn\u2019t thrown them that axe they\u2019d all be dead. For a moment she was afraid, but they rode past her without a flicker of interest. Only Jaqen H\u2019ghar so much as glanced in her direction, and his eyes passed right over her. He does not know me, she thought. Arry was a fierce little boy with a sword, and I\u2019m just a grey mouse girl with a pail.\nShe spent the rest of that day scrubbing steps inside the Wailing Tower. By evenfall her hands were raw and bleeding and her arms so sore they trembled when she lugged the pail back to the cellar. Too tired even for food, Arya begged Weese\u2019s pardons and crawled into her straw to sleep. \u201cWeese,\u201d she yawned. \u201cDunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\u201d She thought she might add three more names to her prayer, but she was too tired to decide tonight.\nArya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand clamped down over her mouth like smooth warm stone, solid and unyielding. She woke at once, squirming and struggling. \u201cA girl says nothing,\u201d a voice whispered close behind her ear. \u201cA girl keeps her lips closed, no one hears, and friends may talk in secret. Yes?\u201d\nHeart pounding, Arya managed the tiniest of nods.\nJaqen H\u2019ghar took his hand away. The cellar was black as pitch and she could not see his face, even inches away. She could smell him, though; his skin smelled clean and soapy, and he had scented his hair. \u201cA boy becomes a girl,\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cI was always a girl. I didn\u2019t think you saw me.\u201d\n\u201cA man sees. A man knows.\u201d\nShe remembered that she hated him. \u201cYou scared me. You\u2019re one of them now, I should have let you burn. What are you doing here? Go away or I\u2019ll yell for Weese.\u201d\n\u201cA man pays his debts. A man owes three.\u201d\n\u201cThree?\u201d\n\u201cThe Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.\u201d\nHe wants to help me, Arya realized with a rush of hope that made her dizzy. \u201cTake me to Riverrun, it\u2019s not far, if we stole some horses we could\u2014\u201d\nHe laid a finger on her lips. \u201cThree lives you shall have of me. No more, no less. Three and we are done. So a girl must ponder.\u201d He kissed her hair softly. \u201cBut not too long.\u201d\nBy the time Arya lit her stub of a candle, only a faint smell remained of him, a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air. The woman in the next niche rolled over on her straw and complained of the light, so Arya blew it out. When she closed her eyes, she saw faces swimming before her. Joffrey and his mother, Ilyn Payne and Meryn Trant and Sandor Clegane\u2026 but they were in King\u2019s Landing hundreds of miles away, and Ser Gregor had lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging, taking Raff and Chiswyck and the Tickler with him. Ser Amory Lorch was here, though, and she hated him almost as much. Didn\u2019t she? She wasn\u2019t certain. And there was always Weese.\nShe thought of him again the next morning, when lack of sleep made her yawn. \u201cWeasel,\u201d Weese purred, \u201cnext time I see that mouth droop open, I\u2019ll pull out your tongue and feed it to my bitch.\u201d He twisted her ear between his fingers to make certain she\u2019d heard, and told her to get back to those steps, he wanted them clean down to the third landing by nightfall.\nAs she worked, Arya thought about the people she wanted dead. She pretended she could see their faces on the steps, and scrubbed harder to wipe them away. The Starks were at war with the Lannisters and she was a Stark, so she should kill as many Lannisters as she could, that was what you did in wars. But she didn\u2019t think she should trust Jaqen. I should kill them myself. Whenever her father had condemned a man to death, he did the deed himself with Ice, his greatsword. \u201cIf you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words,\u201d she\u2019d heard him tell Robb and Jon once.\nThe next day she avoided Jaqen H\u2019ghar, and the day after that. It was not hard. She was very small and Harrenhal was very large, full of places where a mouse could hide.\nAnd then Ser Gregor returned, earlier than expected, driving a herd of goats this time in place of a herd of prisoners. She heard he\u2019d lost four men in one of Lord Beric\u2019s night raids, but those Arya hated returned unscathed and took up residence on the second floor of the Wailing Tower. Weese saw that they were well supplied with drink. \u201cThey always have a good thirst, that lot,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWeasel, go up and ask if they\u2019ve got any clothes that need mending, I\u2019ll have the women see to it.\u201d\nArya ran up her well-scrubbed steps. No one paid her any mind when she entered. Chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand, telling one of his funny stories. She dared not interrupt, unless she wanted a bloody lip.\n\u201cAfter the Hand\u2019s tourney, it were, before the war come,\u201d Chiswyck was saying. \u201cWe were on our ways back west, seven of us with Ser Gregor. Raff was with me, and young Joss Stilwood, he\u2019d squired for Ser in the lists. Well, we come on this pisswater river, running high on account there\u2019d been rains. No way to ford, but there\u2019s an alehouse near, so there we repair. Ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall, and you should see the man\u2019s pig eyes shine at the sight o\u2019 silver. So he\u2019s fetching us ale, him and his daughter, and poor thin stuff it is, no more\u2019n brown piss, which don\u2019t make me any happier, nor Ser neither. And all the time this brewer\u2019s saying how glad he is to have us, custom being slow on account o\u2019 them rains. The fool won\u2019t shut his yap, not him, though Ser is saying not a word, just brooding on the Knight o\u2019 Pansies and that bugger\u2019s trick he played. You can see how tight his mouth sits, so me and the other lads we know better\u2019n to say a squeak to him, but this brewer he\u2019s got to talk, he even asks how m\u2019lord fared in the jousting. Ser just gave him this look.\u201d Chiswyck cackled, quaffed his ale, and wiped the foam away with the back of his hand. \u201cMeanwhile, this daughter of his has been fetching and pouring, a fat little thing, eighteen or so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThirteen, more like,\u201d Raff the Sweetling drawled.\n\u201cWell, be that as it may, she\u2019s not much to look at, but Eggon\u2019s been drinking and gets to touching her, and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raff\u2019s telling young Stilwood that he ought t\u2019 drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it were. Finally Joss reaches up under her skirt, and she shrieks and drops her flagon and goes running off to the kitchen. Well, it would have ended right there, only what does the old fool do but he goes to Ser and asks him to make us leave the girl alone, him being an anointed knight and all such.\n\u201cSer Gregor, he wasn\u2019t paying no mind to none of our fun, but now he looks, you know how he does, and he commands that the girl be brought before him. Now the old man has to drag her out of the kitchen, and no one to blame but hisself. Ser looks her over and says, \u2018So this is the whore you\u2019re so concerned for\u2019 and this besotted old fool says, \u2018My Layna\u2019s no whore, ser\u2019 right to Gregor\u2019s face. Ser, he never blinks, just says, \u2018She is now\u2019 tosses the old man another silver, rips the dress off the wench, and takes her right there on the table in front of her da, her flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises. The look on the old man\u2019s face, I laughed so hard ale was coming out me nose. Then this boy hears the noise, the son I figure, and comes rushing up from the cellar, so Raff has to stick a dirk in his belly. By then Ser\u2019s done, so he goes back to his drinking and we all have a turn. Tobbot, you know how he is, he flops her over and goes in the back way. The girl was done fighting by the time I had her, maybe she\u2019d decided she liked it after all, though to tell the truth I wouldn\u2019t have minded a little wiggling. And now here\u2019s the best bit\u2026 when it\u2019s all done, Ser tells the old man that he wants his change. The girl wasn\u2019t worth a silver, he says\u2026 and damned if that old man didn\u2019t fetch a fistful of coppers, beg m\u2019lord\u2019s pardon, and thank him for the custom!\u201d\nThe men all roared, none louder than Chiswyck himself, who laughed so hard at his own story that snot dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard. Arya stood in the shadows of the stairwell and watched him. She crept back down to the cellars without saying a word. When Weese found that she hadn\u2019t asked about the clothes, he yanked down her breeches and caned her until blood ran down her thighs, but Arya closed her eyes and thought of all the sayings Syrio had taught her, so she scarcely felt it.\nTwo nights later, he sent her to the Barracks Hall to serve at table. She was carrying a flagon of wine and pouring when she glimpsed Jaqen H\u2019ghar at his trencher across the aisle. Chewing her lip, Arya glanced around warily to make certain Weese was not in sight. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself.\nShe took a step, and another, and with each she felt less a mouse. She worked her way down the bench, filling wine cups. Rorge sat to Jaqen\u2019s right, deep drunk, but he took no note of her. Arya leaned close and whispered, \u201cChiswyck,\u201d right in Jaqen\u2019s ear. The Lorathi gave no sign that he had heard.\nWhen her flagon was empty, Arya hurried down to the cellars to refill it from the cask, and quickly returned to her pouring. No one had died of thirst while she was gone, nor even noted her brief absence.\nNothing happened the next day, nor the day after, but on the third day Arya went to the kitchens with Weese to fetch their dinner. \u201cOne of the Mountain\u2019s men fell off a wallwalk last night and broke his fool neck,\u201d she heard Weese tell a cook.\n\u201cDrunk?\u201d the woman asked.\n\u201cNo more\u2019n usual. Some are saying it was Harren\u2019s ghost flung him down.\u201d He snorted to show what he thought of such notions.\nIt wasn\u2019t Harren, Arya wanted to say, it was me. She had killed Chiswyck with a whisper, and she would kill two more before she was through. I\u2019m the ghost in Harrenhal, she thought. And that night, there was one less name to hate.",

      "content": "Catelyn\nThe meeting place was a grassy sward dotted with pale grey mushrooms and the raw stumps of felled trees.\n\u201cWe are the first, my lady,\u201d Hallis Mollen said as they reined up amidst the stumps, alone between the armies. The direwolf banner of House Stark flapped and fluttered atop the lance he bore. Catelyn could not see the sea from here, but she could feel how close it was. The smell of salt was heavy on the wind gusting from the east.\nStannis Baratheon\u2019s foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults. Catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood, and whether Ned had rested here when he led his host south to lift the last siege of Storm\u2019s End. He had won a great victory that day, all the greater for being bloodless.\nGods grant that I shall do the same, Catelyn prayed. Her own liege men thought she was mad even to come. \u201cThis is no fight of ours, my lady,\u201d Ser Wendel Manderly had said. \u201cI know the king would not wish his mother to put herself at risk.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all at risk,\u201d she told him, perhaps too sharply. \u201cDo you think I wish to be here, ser?\u201d I belong at Riverrun with my dying father, at Winterfell with my sons. \u201cRobb sent me south to speak for him, and speak for him I shall.\u201d It would be no easy thing to forge a peace between these brothers, Catelyn knew, yet for the good of the realm, it must be tried.\nAcross rain-sodden flelds and stony ridges, she could see the great castle of Storm\u2019s End rearing up against the sky, its back to the unseen sea. Beneath that mass of pale grey stone, the encircling army of Lord Stannis Baratheon looked as small and insignificant as mice with banners.\nThe songs said that Storm\u2019s End had been raised in ancient days by Durran, the first Storm King, who had won the love of the fair Elenei, daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. On the night of their wedding, Elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortal\u2019s love and thus doomed herself to a mortal\u2019s death, and her grieving parents had unleashed their wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down Durran\u2019s hold. His friends and brothers and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea, but Elenei sheltered Durran within her arms so he took no harm, and when the dawn came at last he declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild.\nFive more castles he built, each larger and stronger than the last, only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay, driving great walls of water before them. His lords pleaded with him to build inland; his priests told him he must placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea; even his smallfolk begged him to relent. Durran would have none of it. A seventh castle he raised, most massive of all. Some said the children of the forest helped him build it, shaping the stones with magic; others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do, a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder. No matter how the tale was told, the end was the same. Though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it, the seventh castle stood defiant, and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there together until the end of their days.\nGods do not forget, and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea. Yet Storm\u2019s End endured, through centuries and tens of centuries, a castle like no other. Its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high, unbroken by arrow slit or postern, everywhere rounded, curving, smooth, its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter. That wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest, and near eighty on the seaward face, a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. Within that mighty bulwark, the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and wave. Of towers, there was but one, a colossal drum tower, windowless where it faced the sea, so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord\u2019s dwelling all in one, crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm.\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d Hal Mollen called. Two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath the castle, and were coming toward them at a slow walk. \u201cThat will be King Stannis.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Catelyn watched them come. Stannis it must be, yet that is not the Baratheon banner. It was a bright yellow, not the rich gold of Renly\u2019s standards, and the device it bore was red, though she could not make out its shape.\nRenly would be last to arrive. He had told her as much when she set out. He did not propose to mount his horse until he saw his brother well on his way. The first to arrive must wait on the other, and Renly would do no waiting. It is a sort of game kings play, she told herself. Well, she was no king, so she need not play it. Catelyn was practiced at waiting.\nAs he neared, she saw that Stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the shape of flames. His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz, and a great square-cut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore. Otherwise his dress was plain: studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet, worn boots, breeches of brown roughspun. The device on his sun-yellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire. The crowned stag was there, yes\u2026 shrunken and enclosed within the heart. Even more curious was his standard bearer\u2014a woman, garbed all in reds, face shadowed within the deep hood of her scarlet cloak. A red priestess, Catelyn thought, wondering. The sect was numerous and powerful in the Free Cities and the distant east, but there were few in the Seven Kingdoms.\n\u201cLady Stark,\u201d Stannis Baratheon said with chill courtesy as he reined up. He inclined his head, balder than she remembered.\n\u201cLord Stannis,\u201d she returned.\nBeneath the tight-trimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard, yet he did not hector her about titles. For that she was duly grateful. \u201cI had not thought to find you at Storm\u2019s End.\u201d\n\u201cI had not thought to be here.\u201d\nHis deepset eyes regarded her uncomfortably. This was not a man made for easy courtesies. \u201cI am sorry for your lord\u2019s death,\u201d he said, \u201cthough Eddard Stark was no friend to me.\u201d\n\u201cHe was never your enemy, my lord. When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you prisoned in that castle, starving, it was Eddard Stark who broke the siege.\u201d\n\u201cAt my brother\u2019s command, not for love of me,\u201d Stannis answered. \u201cLord Eddard did his duty, I will not deny it. Did I ever do less? I should have been Robert\u2019s Hand.\u201d\n\u201cThat was your brother\u2019s will. Ned never wanted it.\u201d\n\u201cYet he took it. That which should have been mine. Still, I give you my word, you shall have justice for his murder.\u201d\nHow they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king. \u201cYour brother promised me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cIf your children are found when I take the city, they shall be sent to you.\u201d Alive or dead, his tone implied.\n\u201cAnd when shall that be, Lord Stannis? King\u2019s Landing is close to your Dragonstone, but I find you here instead.\u201d\n\u201cYou are frank, Lady Stark. Very well, I\u2019ll answer you frankly. To take the city, I need the power of these southron lords I see across the field. My brother has them. I must needs take them from him.\u201d\n\u201cMen give their allegiance where they will, my lord. These lords swore fealty to Robert and House Baratheon. If you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have no quarrel with Renly, should he prove dutiful. I am his elder, and his king. I want only what is mine by rights. Renly owes me loyalty and obedience. I mean to have it. From him, and from these other lords.\u201d Stannis studied her face. \u201cAnd what cause brings you to this field, my lady? Has House Stark cast its lot with my brother, is that the way of it?\u201d\nThis one will never bend, she thought, yet she must try nonetheless. Too much was at stake. \u201cMy son reigns as King in the North, by the will of our lords and people. He bends the knee to no man, but holds out the hand of friendship to all.\u201d\n\u201cKings have no friends,\u201d Stannis said bluntly, \u201conly subjects and enemies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd brothers,\u201d a cheerful voice called out behind her. Catelyn glanced over her shoulder as Lord Renly\u2019s palfrey picked her way through the stumps. The younger Baratheon was splendid in his green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair. The crown of golden roses girded his temples, jade stag\u2019s head rising over his forehead, long black hair spilling out beneath. jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt, and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck.\nRenly had chosen a woman to carry his banner as well, though Brienne hid face and form behind plate armor that gave no hint of her sex. Atop her twelve-foot lance, the crowned stag pranced black-on-gold as the wind off the sea rippled the cloth.\nHis brother\u2019s greeting was curt. \u201cLord Renly.\u201d\n\u201cKing Renly. Can that truly be you, Stannis?\u201d\nStannis frowned. \u201cWho else should it be?\u201d\nRenly gave an easy shrug. \u201cWhen I saw that standard, I could not be certain. Whose banner do you bear?\u201d\n\u201cMine own.\u201d\nThe red-clad priestess spoke up. \u201cThe king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.\u201d\nRenly seemed amused by that. \u201cAll for the good. If we both use the same banner, the battle will be terribly confused.\u201d\nCatelyn said, \u201cLet us hope there will be no battle. We three share a common foe who would destroy us all.\u201d\nStannis studied her, unsmiling. \u201cThe Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny that are my foes.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole of the realm denies it, brother,\u201d said Renly. \u201cOld men deny it with their death rattle, and unborn children deny it in their mothers\u2019wombs. They deny it in Dorne and they deny it on the Wall. No one wants you for their king. Sorry.\u201d\nStannis clenched his jaw, his face taut. \u201cI swore I would never treat with you while you wore your traitor\u2019s crown. Would that I had kept to that vow.\u201d\n\u201cThis is folly,\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cLord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand swords. The remnants of the Kingslayer\u2019s army have regrouped at the Golden Tooth, another Lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of Casterly Rock, and Cersei and her son hold King\u2019s Landing and your precious Iron Throne. You each name yourself king, yet the kingdom bleeds, and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son.\u201d\nRenly shrugged. \u201cYour son has won a few battles. I shall win the war. The Lannisters can wait my pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have proposals to make, make them,\u201d Stannis said brusquely, \u201cor I will be gone.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Renly. \u201cI propose that you dismount, bend your knee, and swear me your allegiance.\u201d\nStannis choked back rage. \u201cThat you shall never have.\u201d\n\u201cYou served Robert, why not me?\u201d\n\u201cRobert was my elder brother. You are the younger.\u201d\n\u201cYounger, bolder, and far more comely\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026and a thief and a usurper besides.\u201d\nRenly shrugged. \u201cThe Targaryens called Robert usurper. He seemed to be able to bear the shame. So shall I.\u201d\nThis will not do. \u201cListen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would bang your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.\u201d\nStannis frowned at her. \u201cYou presume too much, Lady Stark. I am the rightful king, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well.\u201d\nThe naked threat fanned her fury. \u201cYou are very free to name others traitor and usurper, my lord, yet how are you any different? You say you alone are the rightful king, yet it seems to me that Robert had two sons. By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms, Prince Joffrey is his rightful heir, and Tornmen after him\u2026 and we are all traitors, however good our reasons.\u201d\nRenly laughed. \u201cYou must forgive Lady Catelyn, Stannis. She\u2019s come all the way down from Riverrun, a long way ahorse. I fear she never saw your little letter.\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey is not my brother\u2019s seed,\u201d Stannis said bluntly. \u201cNor is Tommen. They are bastards. The girl as well. All three of them abominations born of incest.\u201d\nWould even Cersei be so mad? Catelyn was speechless.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a sweet story, my lady?\u201d Renly asked. \u201cI was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away.\u201d He smiled at his brother. \u201cI had never suspected you were so clever, Stannis. Were it only true, you would indeed be Robert\u2019s heir.\u201d\n\u201cWere it true? Do you name me a liar?\u201d\n\u201cCan you prove any word of this fable?\u201d\nStannis ground his teeth.\nRobert could never have known, Catelyn thought, or Cersei would have lost her head in an instant. \u201cLord Stannis,\u201d she asked, \u201cif you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes, why did you keep silent? \u201c\n\u201cI did not keep silent,\u201d Stannis declared. \u201cI brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn.\u201d\n\u201cRather than your own brother?\u201d\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s regard for me was never more than dutiful,\u201d said Stannis. \u201cFrom me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and self-serving, a means of placing myself first in the line of succession. I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn, whom he loved.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Renly. \u201cSo we have the word of a dead man.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think he died by happenstance, you purblind fool? Cersei had him poisoned, for fear he would reveal her. Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014which doubtless died with him. How inconvenient.\u201d\nCatelyn was remembering, fitting pieces together. \u201cMy sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell,\u201d she admitted. \u201cLater, in the Eyrie, she laid the murder at the feet of the queen\u2019s brother Tyrion.\u201d\nStannis snorted. \u201cIf you step in a nest of snakes, does it matter which one bites you first?\u201d\n\u201cAll this of snakes and incest is droll, but it changes nothing. You may well have the better claim, Stannis, but I still have the larger army.\u201d Renly\u2019s hand slid inside his cloak. Stannis saw, and reached at once for the hilt of his sword, but before he could draw steel his brother produced\u2026 a peach. \u201cWould you like one, brother?\u201d Renly asked, smiling. \u201cFrom Highgarden. You\u2019ve never tasted anything so sweet, I promise you.\u201d He took a bite. juice ran from the corner of his mouth.\n\u201cI did not come here to eat fruit.\u201d Stannis was fuming.\n\u201cMy lords!\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cWe ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance, not trading taunts.\u201d\n\u201cA man should never refuse to taste a peach,\u201d Renly said as he tossed the stone away. \u201cHe may never get the chance again. Life is short, Stannis. Remember what the Starks say. Winter is coming.\u201d He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\u201cI did not come here to be threatened, either.\u201d\n\u201cNor were you,\u201d Renly snapped back. \u201cWhen I make threats, you\u2019ll know it. If truth be told, I\u2019ve never liked you, Stannis, but you are my own blood, and I have no wish to slay you. So if it is Storm\u2019s End you want, take it\u2026 as a brother\u2019s gift. As Robert once gave it to me, I give it to you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not yours to give. It is mine by rights.\u201d\nSighing, Renly half turned in the saddle. \u201cWhat am I to do with this brother of mine, Brienne? He refuses my peach, he refuses my castle, he even shunned my wedding\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe both know your wedding was a mummer\u2019s farce. A year ago you were scheming to make the girl one of Robert\u2019s whores.\u201d\n\u201cA year ago I was scheming to make the girl Robert\u2019s queen,\u201d Renly said, \u201cbut what does it matter? The boar got Robert and I got Margaery. You\u2019ll be pleased to know she came to me a maid.\u201d\n\u201cIn your bed she\u2019s like to die that way.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I expect I\u2019ll get a son on her within the year. Pray, how many sons do you have, Stannis? Oh, yes\u2014none.\u201d Renly smiled innocently. \u201cAs to your daughter, I understand. If my wife looked like yours, I\u2019d send my fool to service her as well.\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Stannis roared. \u201cI will not be mocked to my face, do you hear me? I will not!\u201d He yanked his longsword from its scabbard. The steel gleamed strangely bright in the wan sunlight, now red, now yellow, now blazing white. The air around it seemed to shimmer, as if from heat.\nCatelyn\u2019s horse whinnied and backed away a step, but Brienne moved between the brothers, her own blade in hand. \u201cPut up your steel!\u201d she shouted at Stannis.\nCersei Lannister is laughing herself breathless, Catelyn thought wearily.\nStannis pointed his shining sword at his brother. \u201cI am not without mercy,\u201d thundered he who was notoriously without mercy. \u201cNor do I wish to sully Lightbringer with a brother\u2019s blood. For the sake of the mother who bore us both, I will give you this night to rethink your folly, Renly. Strike your banners and come to me before dawn, and I will grant you Storm\u2019s End and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise, I shall destroy you.\u201d\nRenly laughed. \u201cStannis, that\u2019s a very pretty sword, I\u2019ll grant you, but I think the glow off it has ruined your eyes. Look across the fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?\u201d\n\u201cTyrell swords will make me king. Rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king, with axe and mace and warhammer. Tarth arrows and Penrose lances, Fossoway, Cuy, Mullendore, Estermont, Selmy, Hightower, Oakheart, Crane, Caswell, Blackbar, Morrigen, Beesbury, Shermer, Dunn, Footly\u2026 even House Florent, your own wife\u2019s brothers and uncles, they will make me king. All the chivalry of the south rides with me, and that is the least part of my power. My foot is coming behind, a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes. And you will destroy me? With what, pray? That paltry rabble I see there huddled under the castle walls? I\u2019ll call them five thousand and be generous, codfish lords and onion knights and sellswords. Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts. You have fewer than four hundred horse, my scouts tell me\u2014freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances. I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are, Stannis, that host of yours won\u2019t survive the first charge of my vanguard.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall see, brother.\u201d Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis slid his sword back into its scabbard. \u201cCome the dawn, we shall see.\u201d\n\u201cI hope your new god\u2019s a merciful one, brother.\u201d\nStannis snorted and galloped away, disdainful. The red priestess lingered a moment behind. \u201cLook to your own sins, Lord Renly,\u201d she said as she wheeled her horse around.\nCatelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few waited their return. \u201cThat was amusing, if not terribly profitable,\u201d he commented. \u201cI wonder where I can get a sword like that? Well, doubtless Loras will make me a gift of it after the battle. it grieves me that it must come to this.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a cheerful way of grieving,\u201d said Catelyn, whose distress was not feigned.\n\u201cDo I?\u201d Renly shrugged. \u201cSo be it. Stannis was never the most cherished of brothers, I confess. Do you suppose this tale of his is true? If Joffrey is the Kingslayer\u2019s get\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014your brother is the lawful heir.\u201d\n\u201cWhile he lives,\u201d Renly admitted. \u201cThough it\u2019s a fool\u2019s law, wouldn\u2019t you agree? Why the oldest son, and not the best-fitted? The crown will suit me, as it never suited Robert and would not suit Stannis. I have it in me to be a great king, strong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of forgiveness, patient\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014humble?\u201d Catelyn supplied.\nRenly laughed. \u201cYou must allow a king some flaws, my lady.\u201d\nCatelyn felt very tired. It had all been for nothing. The Baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while her son faced the Lannisters alone, and nothing she could say or do would stop it. It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father\u2019s eyes, she thought. That much at least I can do. I may be a poor envoy, but I am a good mourner, gods save me.\nTheir camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south. It was far more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the Mander, though only a quarter as large. When he\u2019d learned of his brother\u2019s assault on Storm\u2019s End, Renly had split his forces, much as Robb had done at the Twins. His great mass of foot he had left behind at Bitterbridge with his young queen, his wagons, carts, draft animals, and all his cumbersome siege machinery, while Renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east.\nHow like his brother Robert he was, even in that\u2026 only Robert had always had Eddard Stark to temper his boldness with caution. Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to bring up his whole force, to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers. That choice Renly had denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother. He had outdistanced his supply lines, left food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen. He must come to battle soon, or starve.\nCatelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied Renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment. Inside the walls of green silk, his captains and lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley. \u201cMy brother has not changed,\u201d their young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the gold-and-jade crown from his brow. \u201cCastles and courtesies will not appease him, he must have blood. Well, I am of a mind to grant his wish.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace, I see no need for battle here,\u201d Lord Mathis Rowan put in. \u201cThe castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned, Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander, and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm\u2019s End. Let Lord Stannis have his siege. He will find no joy in it, and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless, we will take King\u2019s Landing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have men say I feared to face Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cOnly fools will say that,\u201d Lord Mathis argued.\nRenly looked to the others. \u201cWhat say you all?\u201d\n\u201cI say that Stannis is a danger to you,\u201d Lord Randyll Tarly declared. \u201cLeave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger, while your own power is diminished by battle. The Lannisters will not be beaten in a day. By the time you are done with them, Lord Stannis may be as strong as you\u2026 or stronger.\u201d\nOthers chorused their agreement. The king looked pleased. \u201cWe shall fight, then.\u201d\nI have failed Robb as I failed Ned, Catelyn thought. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she announced. \u201cIf you are set on battle, my purpose here is done. I ask your leave to return to Riverrun.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not have it.\u201d Renly seated himself on a camp chair.\nShe stiffened. \u201cI had hoped to help you make a peace, my lord. I will not help you make a war.\u201d\nRenly gave a shrug. \u201cI daresay we\u2019ll prevail without your five-and-twenty, my lady. I do not mean for you to take part in the battle, only to watch it.\u201d\n\u201cI was at the Whispering Wood, my lord. I have seen enough butchery. I came here an envoy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd an envoy you shall leave,\u201d Renly said, \u201cbut wiser than you came. You shall see what befalls rebels with your own eyes, so your son can hear it from your own lips. We\u2019ll keep you safe, never fear.\u201d He turned away to make his dispositions. \u201cLord Mathis, you shall lead the center of my main battle. Bryce, you\u2019ll have the left. The right is mine. Lord Estermont, you shall command the reserve.\u201d\n\u201cI shall not fail you, Your Grace,\u201d Lord Estermont replied.\nLord Mathis Rowan spoke up. \u201cWho shall have the van?\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Ser Jon Fossoway, \u201cI beg the honor.\u201d\n\u201cBeg all you like,\u201d said Ser Guyard the Green, \u201cby rights it should be one of the seven who strikes the first blow.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall,\u201d Randyll Tarly announced. \u201cI was leading Mace Tyrell\u2019s van when you were still sucking on your mother\u2019s teat, Guyard.\u201d\nA clamor filled the pavilion, as other men loudly set forth their claims. The knights of summer, Catelyn thought. Renly raised a hand. \u201cEnough, my lords. If I had a dozen vans, all of you should have one, but the greatest glory by rights belongs to the greatest knight. Ser Loras shall strike the first blow.\u201d\n\u201cWith a glad heart, Your Grace.\u201d The Knight of Flowers knelt before the king. \u201cGrant me your blessing, and a knight to ride beside me with your banner. Let the stag and rose go to battle side by side.\u201d\nRenly glanced about him. \u201cBrienne.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace?\u201d She was still armored in her blue steel, though she had taken off her helm. The crowded tent was hot, and sweat plastered limp yellow hair to her broad, homely face. \u201cMy place is at your side. I am your sworn shield\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOne of seven,\u201d the king reminded her. \u201cNever fear, four of your fellows will be with me in the fight.\u201d\nBrienne dropped to her knees. \u201cIf I must part from Your Grace, grant me the honor of arming you for battle.\u201d\nCatelyn heard someone snigger behind her. She loves him, poor thing, she thought sadly. She\u2019d play his squire just to touch him, and never care how great a fool they think her.\n\u201cGranted,\u201d Renly said. \u201cNow leave me, all of you. Even kings must rest before a battle.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d Catelyn said, \u201cthere was a small sept in the last village we passed. If you will not permit me to depart for Riverrun, grant me leave to go there and pray.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will. Ser Robar, give Lady Stark safe escort to this sept\u2026 but see that she returns to us by dawn.\u201d\n\u201cYou might do well to pray yourself,\u201d Catelyn added.\n\u201cFor victory?\u201d\n\u201cFor wisdom.\u201d\nRenly laughed. \u201cLoras, stay and help me pray. It\u2019s been so long I\u2019ve quite forgotten how. As to the rest of you, I want every man in place by first light, armed, armored, and horsed. We shall give Stannis a dawn he will not soon forget.\u201d\nDusk was falling when Catelyn left the pavilion. Ser Robar Royce fell in beside her. She knew him slightly\u2014one of Bronze Yohn\u2019s sons, comely in a rough-hewn way, a tourney warrior of some renown. Renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood red armor, and named him one of his seven. \u201cYou are a long way from the Vale, ser,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cAnd you far from Winterfell, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cI know what brought me here, but why have you come? This is not your battle, no more than it is mine.\u201d\n\u201cI made it my battle when I made Renly my king.\u201d\n\u201cThe Royces are bannermen to House Arryn.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty, as does his heir. A second son must find glory where he can.\u201d Ser Robar shrugged. \u201cA man grows weary of tourneys.\u201d\nHe could not be older than one-and-twenty, Catelyn thought, of an age with his king\u2026 but her king, her Robb, had more wisdom at fifteen than this youth had ever learned. Or so she prayed.\nIn Catelyn\u2019s small corner of the camp, Shadd was slicing carrots into a kettle, Hal Mollen was dicing with three of his Winterfell men, and Lucas Blackwood sat sharpening his dagger. \u201cLady Stark,\u201d Lucas said when he saw her, \u201cMollen says it is to be battle at dawn.\u201d\n\u201cHal has the truth of it,\u201d she answered. And a loose tongue as well, it would seem.\n\u201cDo we fight or flee?\u201d\n\u201cWe pray, Lucas,\u201d she answered him. \u201cWe pray.\u201d",

The Hound was always rough-tongued, but something in the way he had looked at her filled her with dread. Had Joffrey found out about her meetings with Ser Dontos? Please no, she thought as she brushed out her hair. Ser Dontos was her only hope. I have to look pretty, Joff likes me to look pretty, he\u2019s always liked me in this gown, this color. She smoothed the cloth down. The fabric was tight across her chest.\nWhen she emerged, Sansa walked on the Hound\u2019s left, away from the burned side of his face. \u201cTell me what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cNot you. Your kingly brother.\u201d\n\u201cRobb\u2019s a traitor.\u201d Sansa knew the words by rote. \u201cI had no part in whatever he did.\u201d Gods be good, don\u2019t let it be the Kingslayer. If Robb had harmed Jaime Lannister, it would mean her life. She thought of Ser Ilyn, and how those terrible pale eyes staring pitilessly out of that gaunt pockmarked face.\nThe Hound snorted. \u201cThey trained you well, little bird.\u201d He conducted her to the lower bailey, where a crowd had gathered around the archery butts. Men moved aside to let them through. She could hear Lord Gyles coughing. Loitering stablehands eyed her insolently, but Ser Horas Redwyne averted his gaze as she passed, and his brother Hobber pretended not to see her. A yellow cat was dying on the ground, mewling piteously, a crossbow quarrel through its ribs. Sansa stepped around it, feeling ill.\nSer Dontos approached on his broomstick horse; since he\u2019d been too drunk to mount his destrier at the tourney, the king had decreed that henceforth he must always go horsed. \u201cBe brave,\u201d he whispered, squeezing her arm.\nJoffrey stood in the center of the throng, winding an ornate crossbow. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn were with him. The sight of them was enough to tie her insides in knots.\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d She fell to her knees.\n\u201cKneeling won\u2019t save you now,\u201d the king said. \u201cStand up. You\u2019re here to answer for your brother\u2019s latest treasons.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that, I beg you, please\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet her up!\u201d\nThe Hound pulled her to her feet, not ungently.\n\u201cSer Lancel,\u201d Joff said, \u201ctell her of this outrage.\u201d\nSansa had always thought Lancel Lannister comely and well spoken, but there was neither pity nor kindness in the look he gave her. \u201cUsing some vile sorcery, your brother fell upon Ser Stafford Lannister with an army of wargs, not three days ride from Lannisport. Thousands of good men were butchered as they slept, without the chance to lift sword. After the slaughter, the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.\u201d\nHorror coiled cold hands around Sansa\u2019s throat.\n\u201cYou have nothing to say?\u201d asked Joffrey.\n\u201cYour Grace, the poor child is shocked witless,\u201d murmured Ser Dontos.\n\u201cSilence, fool.\u201d Joffrey lifted his crossbow and pointed it at her face. \u201cYou Starks are as unnatural as those wolves of yours. I\u2019ve not forgotten how your monster savaged me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was Arya\u2019s wolf,\u201d she said. \u201cLady never hurt you, but you killed her anyway.\u201d\n\u201cNo, your father did,\u201d Joff said, \u201cbut I killed your father. I wish I\u2019d done it myself. I killed a man last night who was bigger than your father. They came to the gate shouting my name and calling for bread like I was some baker, but I taught them better. I shot the loudest one right through the throat.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he died?\u201d With the ugly iron head of the quarrel staring her in the face, it was hard to think what else to say.\n\u201cOf course he died, he had my quarrel in his throat. There was a woman throwing rocks, I got her as well, but only in the arm.\u201d Frowning, he lowered the crossbow. \u201cI\u2019d shoot you too, but if I do Mother says they\u2019d kill my uncle Jaime. Instead you\u2019ll just be punished and we\u2019ll send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesn\u2019t yield. Dog, hit her.\u201d\n\u201cLet me beat her!\u201d Ser Dontos shoved forward, tin armor clattering. He was armed with a \u201cmorningstar\u201d whose head was a melon. My Florian. She could have kissed him, blotchy skin and broken veins and all. He trotted his broomstick around her, shouting \u201cTraitor, traitor\u201d and whacking her over the head with the melon. Sansa covered herself with her hands, staggering every time the fruit pounded her, her hair sticky by the second blow. People were laughing. The melon flew to pieces. Laugh, Joffrey, she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the front of her blue silk gown. Laugh and be satisfied.\nJoffrey did not so much as snigger. \u201cBoros. Meryn.\u201d\nSer Meryn Trant seized Dontos by the arm and flung him brusquely away. The red-faced fool went sprawling, broomstick, melon, and all. Ser Boros seized Sansa.\n\u201cLeave her face,\u201d Joffrey commanded. \u201cI like her pretty.\u201d\nBoros slammed a fist into Sansa\u2019s belly, driving the air out of her. When she doubled over, the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword, and for one hideous instant she was certain he meant to open her throat. As he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs, she thought her legs might break from the force of the blow. Sansa screamed. Tears welled in her eyes. It will be over soon. She soon lost count of the blows.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she heard the Hound rasp.\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d the king replied. \u201cBoros, make her naked.\u201d\nBoros shoved a meaty hand down the front of Sansa\u2019s bodice and gave a hard yank. The silk came tearing away, baring her to the waist. Sansa covered her breasts with her hands. She could hear sniggers, far off and cruel. \u201cBeat her bloody,\u201d Joffrey said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see how her brother fancies\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\nThe Imp\u2019s voice cracked like a whip, and suddenly Sansa was free. She stumbled to her knees, arms crossed over her chest, her breath ragged. \u201cIs this your notion of chivalry, Ser Boros?\u201d Tyrion Lannister demanded angrily. His pet sellsword stood with him, and one of his wildlings, the one with the burned eye. \u201cWhat sort of knight beats helpless maids?\u201d\n\u201cThe sort who serves his king, Imp.\u201d Ser Boros raised his sword, and Ser Meryn stepped up beside him, his blade scraping clear of its scabbard.\n\u201cCareful with those,\u201d warned the dwarf\u2019s sellsword. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get blood all over those pretty white cloaks.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone give the girl something to cover herself with,\u201d the Imp said. Sandor Clegane unfastened his cloak and tossed it at her. Sansa clutched it against her chest, fists bunched hard in the white wool. The coarse weave was scratchy against her skin, but no velvet had ever felt so fine.\n\u201cThis girl\u2019s to be your queen,\u201d the Imp told Joffrey. \u201cHave you no regard for her honor?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m punishing her.\u201d\n\u201cFor what crime? She did not fight her brother\u2019s battle.\u201d\n\u201cShe has the blood of a wolf.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have the wits of a goose.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me that way. The king can do as he likes.\u201d\n\u201cAerys Targaryen did as he liked. Has your mother ever told you what happened to him?\u201d\nSer Boros Blount harrumphed. \u201cNo man threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.\u201d\nTyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am not threatening the king, ser, I am educating my nephew. Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him.\u201d The dwarf smiled. \u201cNow that was a threat, ser. See the difference?\u201d\nSer Boros turned a dark shade of red. \u201cThe queen will hear of this!\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt she will. And why wait? Joffrey, shall we send for your mother? \u201c\nThe king flushed.\n\u201cNothing to say, Your Grace?\u201d his uncle went on. \u201cGood. Learn to use your ears more and your mouth less, or your reign will be shorter than I am. Wanton brutality is no way to win your people\u2019s love\u2026 or your queen\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cFear is better than love, Mother says.\u201d Joffrey pointed at Sansa. \u201cShe fears me.\u201d\nThe Imp sighed. \u201cYes, I see. A pity Stannis and Renly aren\u2019t twelve-year-old girls as well. Bronn, Timett, bring her.\u201d\nSansa moved as if in a dream. She thought the Imp\u2019s men would take her back to her bedchamber in Maegor\u2019s Holdfast, but instead they conducted her to the Tower of the Hand. She had not set foot inside that place since the day her father fell from grace, and it made her feel faint to climb those steps again.\nSome serving girls took charge of her, mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking. One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes, and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair. As they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head, all she could see were the faces from the bailey. Knights are sworn to defend the weak, protect women, and fight for the right, but none of them did a thing. Only Ser Dontos had tried to help, and he was no longer a knight, no more than the Imp was, nor the Hound\u2026 the Hound hated knights\u2026 I hate them too, Sansa thought. They are no true knights, not one of them.\nAfter she was clean, plump ginger-headed Maester Frenken came to see her. He bid her lie facedown on the mattress while he spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered the backs of her legs. Afterward he mixed her a draught of dreamwine, with some honey so it might go down easier. \u201cSleep a bit, child. When you wake, all this will seem a bad dream.\u201d\nNo it won\u2019t, you stupid man, Sansa thought, but she drank the drearnwine anyway, and slept.\nIt was dark when she woke again, not quite knowing where she was, the room both strange and strangely familiar. As she rose, a stab of pain went through her legs and brought it all back. Tears filled her eyes. Someone had laid out a robe for her beside the bed. Sansa slipped it on and opened the door. Outside stood a hard-faced woman with leathery brown skin, three necklaces looped about her scrawny neck. One was gold and one was silver and one was made of human ears. \u201cWhere does she think she\u2019s going?\u201d the woman asked, leaning on a tall spear.\n\u201cThe godswood.\u201d She had to find Ser Dontos, beg him to take her home now before it was too late.\n\u201cThe halfman said you\u2019re not to leave,\u201d the woman said. \u201cPray here, the gods will hear.\u201d\nMeekly, Sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside. She realized suddenly why this place seemed so familiar. They\u2019ve put me in Arya\u2019s old bedchamber, from when Father was the Hand of the King. All her things are gone and the furnishings have been moved around, but it\u2019s the same\u2026\nA short time later, a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives, with a flagon of cold water. \u201cTake it away,\u201d Sansa commanded, but the girl left the food on a table. She was thirsty, she realized. Every step sent knives through her thighs, but she made herself cross the room. She drank two cups of water, and was nibbling on an olive when the knock came.\nAnxiously, she turned toward the door, smoothed down the folds of her robe. \u201cYes?\u201d\nThe door opened, and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside. \u201cMy lady. I trust I am not disturbing you?\u201d\n\u201cAm I your prisoner?\u201d\n\u201cMy guest.\u201d He was wearing his chain of office, a necklace of linked golden hands. \u201cI thought we might talk.\u201d\n\u201cAs my lord commands.\u201d Sansa found it hard not to stare; his face was so ugly it held a queer fascination for her.\n\u201cThe food and garments are to your satisfaction?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf there is anything else you need, you have only to ask.\u201d\n\u201cYou are most kind. And this morning\u2026 it was very good of you to help me.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a right to know why Joffrey was so wroth. Six nights gone, your brother fell upon my uncle Stafford, encamped with his host at a village called Oxcross not three days ride from Casterly Rock. Your northerners won a crushing victory. We received word only this morning.\u201d\nRobb will kill you all, she thought, exulting. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 terrible, my lord. My brother is a vile traitor.\u201d\nThe dwarf smiled wanly. \u201cWell, he\u2019s no fawn, he\u2019s made that clear enough.\u201d\n\u201cSer Lancel said Robb led an army of wargs\u2026\u201d\nThe Imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter. \u201cSer Lancel\u2019s a wineskin warrior who wouldn\u2019t know a warg from a wart. Your brother had his direwolf with him, but I suspect that\u2019s as far as it went. The northmen crept into my uncle\u2019s camp and cut his horse lines, and Lord Stark sent his wolf among them. Even war-trained destriers went mad. Knights were trampled to death in their pavilions, and the rabble woke in terror and fled, casting aside their weapons to run the faster. Ser Stafford was slain as he chased after a horse. Lord Rickard Karstark drove a lance through his chest. Ser Rubert Brax is also dead, along with Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Crakehall, and Lord Jast. Half a hundred more have been taken captive, including Jast\u2019s sons and my nephew Martyn Lannister. Those who survived are spreading wild tales and swearing that the old gods of the north march with your brother.\u201d\n\u201cThen\u2026 there was no sorcery?\u201d\nLannister snorted. \u201cSorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence. My mutton-headed uncle had not even troubled to post sentries, it would seem. His host was raw\u2014apprentice boys, miners, fieldhands, fisherfolk, the sweepings of Lannisport. The only mystery is how your brother reached him. Our forces still hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth, and they swear he did not pass.\u201d The dwarf gave an irritated shrug. \u201cWell, Robb Stark is my father\u2019s bane. Joffrey is mine. Tell me, what do you feel for my kingly nephew?\u201d\n\u201cI love him with all my heart,\u201d Sansa said at once.\n\u201cTruly?\u201d He did not sound convinced. \u201cEven now?\u201d\n\u201cMy love for His Grace is greater than it has ever been.\u201d\nThe Imp laughed aloud. \u201cWell, someone has taught you to lie well. You may be grateful for that one day, child. You are a child still, are you not? Or have you flowered?\u201d\nSansa blushed. It was a rude question, but the shame of being stripped before half the castle made it seem like nothing. \u201cNo, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all to the good. If it gives you any solace, I do not intend that you ever wed Joffrey. No marriage will reconcile Stark and Lannister after all that has happened, I fear. More\u2019s the pity. The match was one of King Robert\u2019s better notions, if Joffrey hadn\u2019t mucked it up.\u201d\nShe knew she ought to say something, but the words caught in her throat.\n\u201cYou grow very quiet,\u201d Tyrion Lannister observed. \u201cIs this what you want? An end to your betrothal?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Sansa did not know what to say. Is it a trick? Will he punish me if I tell the truth? She stared at the dwarf\u2019s brutal bulging brow, the hard black eye and the shrewd green one, the crooked teeth and wiry beard. \u201cI only want to be loyal.\u201d\n\u201cLoyal,\u201d the dwarf mused, \u201cand far from any Lannisters. I can scarce blame you for that. When I was your age, I wanted the same thing.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThey tell me you visit the godswood every day. What do you pray for, Sansa?\u201d\nI pray for Robb\u2019s victory and Joffrey\u2019s death\u2026 and for home. For Winterfell. \u201cI pray for an end to the fighting.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have that soon enough. There will be another battle, between your brother Robb and my lord father, and that will settle the issue.\u201d\nRobb will beat him, Sansa thought. He beat your uncle and your brother Jaime, he\u2019ll beat your father too.\nIt was as if her face were an open book, so easily did the dwarf read her hopes. \u201cDo not take Oxcross too much to heart, my lady,\u201d he told her, not unkindly. \u201cA battle is not a war, and my lord father is assuredly not my uncle Stafford. The next time you visit the godswood, pray that your brother has the wisdom to bend the knee. Once the north returns to the king\u2019s peace, I mean to send you home.\u201d He hopped down off the window seat and said, \u201cYou may sleep here tonight. I\u2019ll give you some of my own men as a guard, some Stone Crows perhaps\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa blurted out, aghast. If she was locked in the Tower of the Hand, guarded by the dwarf\u2019s men, how would Ser Dontos ever spirit her away to freedom?\n\u201cWould you prefer Black Ears? I\u2019ll give you Chella if a woman would make you more at ease.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, no, my lord, the wildlings frighten me.\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cMe as well. But more to the point, they frighten Joffrey and that nest of sly vipers and lickspittle dogs he calls a Kingsguard. With Chella or Timett by your side, no one would dare offer you harm.\u201d\n\u201cI would sooner return to my own bed.\u201d A lie came to her suddenly, but it seemed so right that she blurted it out at once. \u201cThis tower was where my father\u2019s men were slain. Their ghosts would give me terrible dreams, and I would see their blood wherever I looked.\u201d\nTyrion Lannister studied her face. \u201cI am no stranger to nightmares, Sansa. Perhaps you are wiser than I knew. Permit me at least to escort you safely back to your own chambers.\u201d",

      "content": "Catelyn\nIt was full dark before they found the village. Catelyn found herself wondering if the place had a name. If so, its people had taken that knowledge with them when they fled, along with all they owned, down to the candles in the sept. Ser Wendel lit a torch and led her through the low door.\nWithin, the seven walls were cracked and crooked. God is one, Septon Osmynd had taught her when she was a girl, with seven aspects, as the sept is a single building, with seven walls. The wealthy septs of the cities had statues of the Seven and an altar to each. In Winterfell, Septon Chayle hung carved masks from each wall. Here Catelyn found only rough charcoal drawings. Ser Wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door, and left to wait outside with Robar Royce.\nCatelyn studied the faces. The Father was bearded, as ever. The Mother smiled, loving and protective. The Warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face, the Smith his hammer. The Maid was beautiful, the Crone wizened and wise.\nAnd the seventh face\u2026 the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable. Here the face was a black oval, a shadow with stars for eyes. It made Catelyn uneasy. She would get scant comfort there.\nShe knelt before the Mother. \u201cMy lady, look down on this battle with a mother\u2019s eyes. They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon. Would that I were with them.\u201d\nA crack ran down through the Mother\u2019s left eye. It made her look as if she were crying. Catelyn could hear Ser Wendel\u2019s booming voice, and now and again Ser Robar\u2019s quiet answers, as they talked of the coming battle. Otherwise the night was still. Not even a cricket could be heard, and the gods kept their silence. Did your old gods ever answer you, Ned? she wondered. When you knelt before your heart tree, did they hear you?\nFlickering torchlight danced across the walls, making the faces seem half alive, twisting them, changing them. The statues in the great septs of the cities wore the faces the stonemasons had given them, but these charcoal scratchings were so crude they might be anyone. The Father\u2019s face made her think of her own father, dying in his bed at Riverrun. The Warrior was Renly and Stannis, Robb and Robert, Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow. She even glimpsed Arya in those lines, just for an instant. Then a gust of wind through the door made the torch sputter, and the semblance was gone, washed away in orange glare.\nThe smoke was making her eyes burn. She rubbed at them with the heels of her scarred hands. When she looked up at the Mother again, it was her own mother she saw. Lady Minisa Tully had died in childbed, trying to give Lord Hoster a second son. The baby had perished with her, and afterward some of the life had gone out of Father. She was always so calm, Catelyn thought, remembering her mother\u2019s soft hands, her warm smile. If she had lived, how different our lives might have been. She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter, kneeling here before her. I have come so many thousands of leagues, and for what? Who have I served? I have lost my daughters, Robb does not want me, and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother. I was not even with Ned when he died\u2026\nHer head swam, and the sept seemed to move around her. The shadows swayed and shifted, furtive animals racing across the cracked white walls. Catelyn had not eaten today. Perhaps that had been unwise. She told herself that there had been no time, but the truth was that food had lost its savor in a world without Ned. When they took his head off, they killed me too.\nBehind her the torch spit, and suddenly it seemed to her that it was her sister\u2019s face on the wall, though the eyes were harder than she recalled, not Lysa\u2019s eyes but Cersei\u2019s. Cersei is a mother too. No matter who fathered those children, she felt them kick inside her, brought them forth with her pain and blood, nursed them at her breast. If they are truly Jaime\u2019s\u2026\n\u201cDoes Cersei pray to you too, my lady?\u201d Catelyn asked the Mother. She could see the proud, cold, lovely features of the Lannister queen etched upon the wall. The crack was still there; even Cersei could weep for her children. \u201cEach of the Seven embodies all of the Seven,\u201d Septon Osmynd had told her once. There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the Maiden, and the Mother could be fiercer than the Warrior when her children were in danger. Yes\u2026\nShe had seen enough of Robert Baratheon at Winterfell to know that the king did not regard Joffrey with any great warmth. If the boy was truly Jaime\u2019s seed, Robert would have put him to death along with his mother, and few would have condemned him. Bastards were common enough, but incest was a monstrous sin to both old gods and new, and the children of such wickedness were named abominations in sept and godswood alike. The dragon kings had wed brother to sister, but they were the blood of old Valyria where such practices had been common, and like their dragons the Targaryens answered to neither gods nor men.\nNed must have known, and Lord Arryn before him. Small wonder that the queen had killed them both. Would I do any less for my own? Catelyn clenched her hands, feeling the tightness in her scarred fingers where the assassin\u2019s steel had cut to the bone as she fought to save her son. \u201cBran knows too,\u201d she whispered, lowering her head. Gods be good, he must have seen something, heard something, that was why they tried to kill him in his bed.\nLost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles. Lastly she turned to the Crone, whose statues often showed her with a lamp in one hand. \u201cGuide me, wise lady,\u201d she prayed. \u201cShow me the path I must walk, and do not let me stumble in the dark places that lie ahead.\u201d\nFinally there were footsteps behind her, and a noise at the door. \u201cMy lady,\u201d Ser Robar said gently, \u201cpardon, but our time is at an end. We must be back before the dawn breaks.\u201d\nCatelyn rose stiffly. Her knees ached, and she would have given much for a featherbed and a pillow just then. \u201cThank you, ser. I am ready.\u201d\nThey rode in silence through sparse woodland where the trees leaned drunkenly away from the sea. The nervous whinny of horses and the clank of steel guided them back to Renly\u2019s camp. The long ranks of man and horse were armored in darkness, as black as if the Smith had hammered night itself into steel. There were banners to her right, banners to her left, and rank on rank of banners before her, but in the predawn gloom, neither colors nor sigils could be discerned. A grey army, Catelyn thought. Grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. As they sat their horses waiting, Renly\u2019s shadow knights pointed their lances upward, so she rode through a forest of tall naked trees, bereft of leaves and life. Where Storm\u2019s End stood was only a deeper darkness, a wall of black through which no stars could shine, but she could see torches moving across the fields where Lord Stannis had made his camp.\nThe candles within Renly\u2019s pavilion made the shimmering silken walls seem to glow, transforming the great tent into a magical castle alive with emerald light. Two of the Rainbow Guard stood sentry at the door to the royal pavilion. The green light shone strangely against the purple plums of Ser Parmen\u2019s surcoat, and gave a sickly hue to the sunflowers that covered every inch of Ser Emmon\u2019s enameled yellow plate. Long silken plumes flew from their helms, and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders.\nWithin, Catelyn found Brienne armoring the king for battle while the Lords Tarly and Rowan spoke of dispositions and tactics. It was pleasantly warm inside, the heat shimmering off the coals in a dozen small iron braziers. \u201cI must speak with you, Your Grace,\u201d she said, granting him a king\u2019s style for once, anything to make him heed her.\n\u201cIn a moment, Lady Catelyn,\u201d Renly replied. Brienne fit backplate to breastplate over his quilted tunic. The king\u2019s armor was a deep green, the green of leaves in a summer wood, so dark it drank the candlelight. Gold highlights gleamed from inlay and fastenings like distant fires in that wood, winking every time he moved. \u201cPray continue, Lord Mathis.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Mathis Rowan said with a sideways glance at Catelyn. \u201cAs I was saying, our battles are well drawn up. Why wait for daybreak? Sound the advance.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have it said that I won by treachery, with an unchivalrous attack? Dawn was the chosen hour.\u201d\n\u201cChosen by Stannis,\u201d Randyll Tarly pointed out. \u201cHe\u2019d have us charge into the teeth of the rising sun. We\u2019ll be half-blind.\u201d\n\u201cOnly until first shock,\u201d Renly said confidently. \u201cSer Loras will break them, and after that it will be chaos.\u201d Brienne tightened green leather straps and buckled golden buckles. \u201cWhen my brother falls, see that no insult is done to his corpse. He is my own blood, I will not have his head paraded about on a spear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he yields?\u201d Lord Tarly asked.\n\u201cYields?\u201d Lord Rowan laughed. \u201cWhen Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storm\u2019s End, Stannis ate rats rather than open his gates.\u201d\n\u201cWell I remember.\u201d Renly lifted his chin to allow Brienne to fasten his gorget in place. \u201cNear the end, Ser Gawen Wylde and three of his knights tried to steal out a postern gate to surrender. Stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults. I can still see Gawen\u2019s face as they strapped him down. He had been our master-at-arms.\u201d\nLord Rowan appeared puzzled. \u201cNo men were hurled from the walls. I would surely remember that.\u201d\n\u201cMaester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead, and there was no gain in flinging away good meat.\u201d Renly pushed back his hair. Brienne bound it with a velvet tie and pulled a padded cap down over his ears, to cushion the weight of his helm. \u201cThanks to the Onion Knight we were never reduced to dining on corpses, but it was a close thing. Too close for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Catelyn had waited patiently, but time grew short. \u201cYou promised me a word.\u201d\nRenly nodded. \u201cSee to your battles, my lords\u2026 oh, and if Barristan Selmy is at my brother\u2019s side, I want him spared.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no word of Ser Barristan since Joffrey cast him out,\u201d Lord Rowan objected.\n\u201cI know that old man. He needs a king to guard, or who is he? Yet he never came to me, and Lady Catelyn says he is not with Robb Stark at Riverrun. Where else but with Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Your Grace. No harm will come to him.\u201d The lords bowed deeply and departed.\n\u201cSay your say, Lady Stark,\u201d Renly said. Brienne swept his cloak over his broad shoulders. It was cloth-of-gold, heavy, with the crowned stag of Baratheon picked out in flakes of jet.\n\u201cThe Lannisters tried to kill my son Bran. A thousand times I have asked myself why. Your brother gave me my answer. There was a hunt the day he fell. Robert and Ned and most of the other men rode out after boar, but Jaime Lannister remained at Winterfell, as did the queen.\u201d\nRenly was not slow to take the implication. \u201cSo you believe the boy caught them at their incest\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI beg you, my lord, grant me leave to go to your brother Stannis and tell him what I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cTo what end?\u201d\n\u201cRobb will set aside his crown if you and your brother will do the same,\u201d she said, hoping it was true. She would make it true if she must; Robb would listen to her, even if his lords would not. \u201cLet the three of you call for a Great Council, such as the realm has not seen for a hundred years. We will send to Winterfell, so Bran may tell his tale and all men may know the Lannisters for the true usurpers. Let the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose who shall rule them.\u201d\nRenly laughed. \u201cTell me, my lady, do direwolves vote on who should lead the pack?\u201d Brienne brought the king\u2019s gauntlets and greathelm, crowned with golden antlers that would add a foot and a half to his height. \u201cThe time for talk is done. Now we see who is stronger.\u201d Renly pulled a lobstered green-and-gold gauntlet over his left hand, while Brienne knelt to buckle on his belt, heavy with the weight of longsword and dagger.\n\u201cI beg you in the name of the Mother,\u201d Catelyn began when a sudden gust of wind flung open the door of the tent. She thought she glimpsed movement, but when she turned her head, it was only the king\u2019s shadow shifting against the silken walls. She heard Renly begin a jest, his shadow moving, lifting its sword, black on green, candles guttering, shivering, something was queer, wrong, and then she saw Renly\u2019s sword still in its scabbard, sheathed still, but the shadowsword\u2026\n\u201cCold,\u201d said Renly in a small puzzled voice, a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there. He had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat.\n\u201cYour Gr\u2014no!\u201d cried Brienne the Blue when she saw that evil flow, sounding as scared as any little girl. The king stumbled into her arms, a sheet of blood creeping down the front of his armor, a dark red tide that drowned his green and gold. More candles guttered out. Renly tried to speak, but he was choking on his own blood. His legs collapsed, and only Brienne\u2019s strength held him up. She threw back her head and screamed, wordless in her anguish.\nThe shadow. Something dark and evil had happened here, she knew, something that she could not begin to understand. Renly never cast that shadow. Death came in that door and blew the life out of him as swift as the wind snuffed out his candles.\nOnly a few instants passed before Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy came bursting in, though it felt like half the night. A pair of men-at-arms crowded in behind with torches. When they saw Renly in Brienne\u2019s arms, and her drenched with the king\u2019s blood, Ser Robar gave a cry of horror. \u201cWicked woman!\u201d screamed Ser Emmon, he of the sunflowered steel. \u201cAway from him, you vile creature!\u201d\n\u201cGods be good, Brienne, why?\u201d asked Ser Robar.\nBrienne looked up from her king\u2019s body. The rainbow cloak that hung from her shoulders had turned red where the king\u2019s blood had soaked into the cloth. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll die for this.\u201d Ser Emmon snatched up a long-handled battleaxe from the weapons piled near the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for the king\u2019s life with your own!\u201d\n\u201cNO!\u201d Catelyn Stark screamed, finding her voice at last, but it was too late, the blood madness was on them, and they rushed forward with shouts that drowned her softer words.\nBrienne moved faster than Catelyn would have believed. Her own sword was not to hand, so she snatched Renly\u2019s from its scabbard and raised it to catch Emmon\u2019s axe on the downswing. A spark flashed blue-white as steel met steel with a rending crash, and Brienne sprang to her feet, the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside. Ser Emmon stumbled over it as he tried to close, and Brienne\u2019s blade sheared through the wooden haft to send his axehead spinning. Another man thrust a flaming torch at her back, but the rainbow cloak was too sodden with blood to burn. Brienne spun and cut, and torch and hand went flying. Flames crept across the carpet. The maimed man began to scream. Ser Emmon dropped the axe and fumbled for his sword. The second man-at-arms lunged, Brienne parried, and their swords danced and clanged against each other. When Emmon Cuy came wading back in, Brienne was forced to retreat, yet somehow she held them both at bay. On the ground, Renly\u2019s head rolled sickeningly to one side, and a second mouth yawned wide, the blood coming from him now in slow pulses.\nSer Robar had hung back, uncertain, but now he was reaching for his hilt. \u201cRobar, no, listen.\u201d Catelyn seized his arm. \u201cYou do her wrong, it was not her. Help her! Hear me, it was Stannis.\u201d The name was on her lips before she could think how it got there, but as she said it, she knew that it was true. \u201cI swear it, you know me, it was Stannis killed him.\u201d\nThe young rainbow knight stared at this madwoman with pale and frightened eyes. \u201cStannis? How?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know. Sorcery, some dark magic, there was a shadow, a shadow.\u201d Her own voice sounded wild and crazed to her, but the words poured out in a rush as the blades continued to clash behind her. \u201cA shadow with a sword, I swear it, I saw. Are you blind, the girl loved him! Help her!\u201d She glanced back, saw the second guardsman fall, his blade dropping from limp fingers. Outside there was shouting. More angry men would be bursting in on them any instant, she knew. \u201cShe is innocent, Robar. You have my word, on my husband\u2019s grave and my honor as a Stark!\u201d\nThat resolved him. \u201cI will hold them,\u201d Ser Robar said. \u201cGet her away.\u201d He turned and went out.\nThe fire had reached the wall and was creeping up the side of the tent. Ser Emmon was pressing Brienne hard, him in his enameled yellow steel and her in wool. He had forgotten Catelyn, until the iron brazier came crashing into the back of his head. Helmed as he was, the blow did no lasting harm, but it sent him to his knees. \u201cBrienne, with me,\u201d Catelyn commanded. The girl was not slow to see the chance. A slash, and the green silk parted. They stepped out into darkness and the chill of dawn. Loud voices came from the other side of the pavilion. \u201cThis way,\u201d Catelyn urged, \u201cand slowly. We must not run, or they will ask why. Walk easy, as if nothing were amiss.\u201d\nBrienne thrust her sword blade through her belt and fell in beside Catelyn. The night air smelled of rain. Behind them, the king\u2019s pavilion was well ablaze, flames rising high against the dark. No one made any move to stop them. Men rushed past them, shouting of fire and murder and sorcery. Others stood in small groups and spoke in low voices. A few were praying, and one young squire was on his knees, sobbing openly.\nRenly\u2019s battles were already coming apart as the rumors spread from mouth to mouth. The nightfires had burned low, and as the east began to lighten the immense mass of Storm\u2019s End emerged like a dream of stone while wisps of pale mist raced across the field, flying from the sun on wings of wind. Morning ghosts, she had heard Old Nan call them once, spirits returning to their graves. And Renly one of them now, gone like his brother Robert, like her own dear Ned.\n\u201cI never held him but as he died,\u201d Brienne said quietly as they walked through the spreading chaos. Her voice sounded as if she might break at any instant. \u201cHe was laughing one moment, and suddenly the blood was everywhere\u2026 my lady, I do not understand. Did you see, did you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI saw a shadow. I thought it was Renly\u2019s shadow at the first, but it was his brother\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cI felt him. It makes no sense, I know\u2026\u201d\nIt made sense enough for Brienne. \u201cI will kill him,\u201d the tall homely girl declared. \u201cWith my lord\u2019s own sword, I will kill him. I swear it. I swear it. I swear it.\u201d\nHal Mollen and the rest of her escort were waiting with the horses. Ser Wendel Manderly was all in a lather to know what was happening. \u201cMy lady, the camp has gone mad,\u201d he blurted when he saw them. \u201cLord Renly, is he\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly, staring at Brienne and the blood that drenched her.\n\u201cDead, but not by our hands.\u201d\n\u201cThe battle\u2014\u201d Hal Mollen began.\n\u201cThere will be no battle.\u201d Catelyn mounted, and her escort formed up about her, with Ser Wendel to her left and Ser Perwyn Frey on her right. \u201cBrienne, we brought mounts enough for twice our number. Choose one, and come with us.\u201d\n\u201cI have my own horse, my lady. And my armor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave them. We must be well away before they think to look for us. We were both with the king when he was killed. That will not be forgotten.\u201d Wordless, Brienne turned and did as she was bid. \u201cRide,\u201d Catelyn commanded her escort when they were all ahorse. \u201cIf any man tries to stop us, cut him down.\u201d\nAs the long fingers of dawn fanned across the fields, color was returning to the world. Where grey men had sat grey horses armed with shadow spears, the points of ten thousand lances now glinted silverly cold, and on the myriad flapping banners Catelyn saw the blush of red and pink and orange, the richness of blues and browns, the blaze of gold and yellow. All the power of Storm\u2019s End and Highgarden, the power that had been Renly\u2019s an hour ago. They belong to Stannis now, she realized, even if they do not know it themselves yet. Where else are they to turn, if not to the last Baratheon? Stannis has won all with a single evil stroke.\nI am the rightful king, he had declared, his jaw clenched hard as iron, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well.\nA chill went through her.",

      "content": "Jon\nThe hill jutted above the dense tangle of forest, rising solitary and sudden, its windswept heights visible from miles off. The wildlings called it the Fist of the First Men, rangers said. It did look like a fist, Jon Snow thought, punching up through earth and wood, its bare brown slopes knuckled with stone.\nHe rode to the top with Lord Mormont and the officers, leaving Ghost below under the trees. The direwolf had run off three times as they climbed, twice returning reluctantly to Jon\u2019s whistle. The third time, the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped, \u201cLet him go, boy. I want to reach the crest before dusk. Find the wolf later.\u201d\nThe way up was steep and stony, the summit crowned by a chest-high wall of tumbled rocks. They had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit the horses. \u201cThis is good ground, Thoren,\u201d the Old Bear proclaimed when at last they attained the top. \u201cWe could scarce hope for better. We\u2019ll make our camp here to await Halfhand.\u201d The Lord Commander swung down off his saddle, dislodging the raven from his shoulder. Complaining loudly, the bird took to the air.\nThe views atop the hill were bracing, yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon\u2019s eye, the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen, their beards of green moss. It was said that the Fist had been a ringfort of the First Men in the Dawn Age. \u201cAn old place, and strong,\u201d Thoren Smallwood said.\n\u201cOld,\u201d Mormont\u2019s raven screamed as it flapped in noisy circles about their heads. \u201cOld, old, old.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d Mormont growled up at the bird. The Old Bear was too proud to admit to weakness, but Jon was not deceived. The strain of keeping up with younger men was taking its toll.\n\u201cThese heights will be easy to defend, if need be,\u201d Thoren pointed out as he walked his horse along the ring of stones, his sable-trimmed cloak stirring in the wind.\n\u201cYes, this place will do.\u201d The Old Bear lifted a hand to the wind, and raven landed on his forearm, claws scrabbling against his black ringmail.\n\u201cWhat about water, my lord?\u201d Jon wondered.\n\u201cWe crossed a brook at the foot of the hill.\u201d\n\u201cA long climb for a drink,\u201d Jon pointed out, \u201cand outside the ring of stones.\u201d\nThoren said, \u201cAre you too lazy to climb a hill, boy?\u201d\nWhen Lord Mormont said, \u201cWe\u2019re not like to find another place as strong. We\u2019ll carry water, and make certain we are well supplied,\u201d Jon knew better than to argue. So the command was given, and the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made. Black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain, and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground. Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines, and saw them fed and watered. Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night. A score of builders set to clearing brush, digging latrines, and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes. \u201cI will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark,\u201d the Old Bear had commanded.\nOnce he\u2019d put up the Lord Commander\u2019s tent and seen to their horses, Jon Snow descended the hill in search of Ghost. The direwolf came at once, all in silence. One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees, whistling and shouting, alone in the green, pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet; the next, the great white direwolf was walking beside him, pale as morning mist.\nBut when they reached the ringfort, Ghost balked again. He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones, and then retreated, as if he did not like what he\u2019d smelled. Jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring, no easy task; the wolf weighed as much as he did, and was stronger by far. \u201cGhost, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d It was not like him to be so unsettled. In the end Jon had to give it up. \u201cAs you will,\u201d he told the wolf. \u201cGo, hunt.\u201d The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones.\nThey ought to be safe here. The hill offered commanding views, and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east. Yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees, Jon\u2019s sense of foreboding grew. This is the haunted forest, he told himself. Maybe there are ghosts here, the spirits of the First Men. This was their place, once.\n\u201cStop acting the boy,\u201d he told himself. Clambering atop the piled rocks, Jon gazed off toward the setting sun. He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south. Upriver the land was more rugged, the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west. On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow, range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance, their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow. Even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable.\nCloser at hand, it was the trees that ruled. To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see, a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green, with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels, or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn. When the wind blew, he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was. A thousand leaves fluttered, and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea, storm-tossed and heaving, eternal and unknowable.\nGhost was not like to be alone down there, he thought. Anything could be moving under that sea, creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood, concealed beneath those trees. Anything. How would they ever know? He stood there for a long time, until the sun vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest.\n\u201cJon?\u201d Samwell Tarly called up. \u201cI thought it looked like you. Are you well?\u201d\n\u201cWell enough.\u201d Jon hopped down. \u201cHow did you fare today?\u201d\n\u201cWell. I fared well. Truly.\u201d\nJon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend, not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find his courage. \u201cThe Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow Tower.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a strong place,\u201d said Sam. \u201cA ringfort of the First Men. Do you think there were battles fought here?\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt. You\u2019d best get a bird ready. Mormont will want to send back word.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could send them all. They hate being caged.\u201d\n\u201cYou would too, if you could fly.\u201d\n\u201cIf I could fly, I\u2019d be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie,\u201d said Sam.\nJon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand. They walked back through the camp together. Cookfires were being lit all around them. Overhead, the stars were coming out. The long red tail of Mormont\u2019s Torch burned as bright as the moon. Jon heard the ravens before he saw them. Some were calling his name. The birds were not shy when it came to making noise.\nThey feel it too. \u201cI\u2019d best see to the Old Bear,\u201d he said. \u201cHe gets noisy when he isn\u2019t fed as well.\u201d\nHe found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers. \u201cThere you are,\u201d the old man said gruffly. \u201cBring us some hot wine, if you would. The night is chilly.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Jon built a cookfire, claimed a small cask of Mormont\u2019s favorite robust red from stores, and poured it into a kettle. He hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients. The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine. So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey, not a drop more. Raisins and nuts and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy\u2014which was queer, since he always took lemon in his morning beer. The drink must be hot to warm a man properly, the Lord Commander insisted, but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil. Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle.\nAs he worked, he could hear the voices from inside the tent. Jarman Buckwell said, \u201cThe easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source. Yet if we go that path, Rayder will know of our approach, certain as sunrise.\u201d\n\u201cThe Giant\u2019s Stair might serve,\u201d said Ser Mallador Locke, \u201cor the Skirling Pass, if it\u2019s clear.\u201d\nThe wine was steaming. Jon lifted the kettle off the fire, filled eight cups, and carried them into the tent. The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn him that night back in Craster\u2019s Keep. He took a cup from Jon\u2019s tray, tried a swallow of wine, and gave a brusque nod of approval. His raven hopped down his arm. \u201cCorn,\u201d it said. \u201cCorn. Corn.\u201d\nSer Ottyn Wythers waved the wine away. \u201cI would not go into the mountains at all,\u201d he said in a thin, tired voice. \u201cThe Frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer, and now\u2026 if we should be caught by a storm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must,\u201d said Mormont. \u201cWildlings can no more live on snow and stone than we can. They will emerge from the heights soon, and for a host of any size, the only route is along the Milkwater. If so, we are strongly placed here. They cannot hope to slip by us.\u201d\n\u201cThey may not wish to. They are thousands, and we will be three hundred when the Halfhand reaches us.\u201d Ser Mallador accepted a cup from Jon.\n\u201cIf it comes to battle, we could not hope for better ground than here,\u201d declared Mormont. \u201cWe\u2019ll strengthen the defenses. Pits and spikes, caltrops scattered on the slopes, every breach mended. Jarman, I\u2019ll want your sharpest eyes as watchers. A ring of them, all around us and along the river, to warn of any approach. Hide them up in trees. And we had best start bringing up water too, more than we need. We\u2019ll dig cisterns. It will keep the men occupied, and may prove needful later.\u201d\n\u201cMy rangers\u2014\u201d started Thoren Smallwood.\n\u201cYour rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us. After that, we\u2019ll see. I will not lose more of my men.\u201d\n\u201cMance Rayder might be massing his host a day\u2019s ride from here, and we\u2019d never know,\u201d Smallwood complained.\n\u201cWe know where the wildlings are massing,\u201d Mormont came back. \u201cWe had it from Craster. I mislike the man, but I do not think he lied to us in this.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say.\u201d Smallwood took a sullen leave. The others finished their wine and followed, more courteously.\n\u201cShall I bring you supper, my lord?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cCorn,\u201d the raven cried. Mormont did not answer at once. When he did he said only, \u201cDid your wolf find game today?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not back yet.\u201d\n\u201cWe could do with fresh meat.\u201d Mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful of corn. \u201cYou think I\u2019m wrong to keep the rangers close?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to say, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cIt is if you\u2019re asked.\u201d\n\u201cIf the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I don\u2019t see how they can hope to find my uncle,\u201d Jon admitted.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t.\u201d The raven pecked at the kernels in the Old Bear\u2019s palm. \u201cTwo hundred men or ten thousand, the country is too vast.\u201d The corn gone, Mormont turned his hand over.\n\u201cYou would not give up the search?\u201d\n\u201cMaester Aemon thinks you clever.\u201d Mormont moved the raven to his shoulder. The bird tilted its head to one side, little eyes a-glitter.\nThe answer was there. \u201cIs it\u2026 it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred than for two hundred to find one.\u201d\nThe raven gave a cackling scream, but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of his beard. \u201cThis many men and horses leave a trail even Aemon could follow. On this hill, our fires ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the Frostfangs. If Ben Stark is alive and free, he will come to us, I have no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Jon, \u201cbut\u2026 what if\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026he\u2019s dead?\u201d Mormont asked, not unkindly.\nJon nodded, reluctantly.\n\u201cDead,\u201d the raven said. \u201cDead. Dead.\u201d\n\u201cHe may come to us anyway,\u201d the Old Bear said. \u201cAs Othor did, and Jafer Flowers. I dread that as much as you, Jon, but we must admit the possibility.\u201d\n\u201cDead,\u201d his raven cawed, ruffling its wings. Its voice grew louder and more shrill. \u201cDead.\u201d\nMormont stroked the bird\u2019s black feathers, and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his hand. \u201cI will forsake supper, I believe. Rest will serve me better. Wake me at first light.\u201d\n\u201cSleep well, my lord.\u201d Jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside. He heard distant laughter, the plaintive sound of pipes. A great blaze was crackling in the center of the camp, and he could smell stew cooking. The Old Bear might not be hungry, but Jon was. He drifted over toward the fire.\nDywen was holding forth, spoon in hand. \u201cI know this wood as well as any man alive, and I tell you, I wouldn\u2019t care to ride through it alone tonight. Can\u2019t you smell it?\u201d\nGrenn was staring at him with wide eyes, but Dolorous Edd said, \u201cAll I smell is the shit of two hundred horses. And this stew. Which has a similar aroma, now that I come to sniff it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got your similar aroma right here.\u201d Hake patted his dirk. Grumbling, he filled Jon\u2019s bowl from the kettle.\nThe stew was thick with barley, carrot, and onion, with here and there a ragged shred of salt beef, softened in the cooking.\n\u201cWhat is it you smell, Dywen?\u201d asked Grenn.\nThe forester sucked on his spoon a moment. He had taken out his teeth. His face was leathery and wrinkled, his hands gnarled as old roots. \u201cSeems to me like it smells\u2026 well\u2026 cold.\u201d\n\u201cYour head\u2019s as wooden as your teeth,\u201d Hake told him. \u201cThere\u2019s no smell to cold.\u201d\nThere is, thought Jon, remembering the night in the Lord Commander\u2019s chambers. It smells like death. Suddenly he was not hungry anymore. He gave his stew to Grenn, who looked in need of an extra supper to warm him against the night.\nThe wind was blowing briskly when he left. By morning, frost would cover the ground, and the tent ropes would be stiff and frozen. A few fingers of spiced wine sloshed in the bottom of the kettle. Jon fed fresh wood to the fire and put the kettle over the flames to reheat. He flexed his fingers as he waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled. The first watch had taken up their stations around the perimeter of the camp. Torches flickered all along the ringwall. The night was moonless, but a thousand stars shone overhead.\nA sound rose out of the darkness, faint and distant, but unmistakable: the howling of wolves. Their voices rose and fell, a chilly song, and lonely. It made the hairs rise along the back of his neck. Across the fire, a pair of red eyes regarded him from the shadows. The light of the flames made them glow.\n\u201cGhost,\u201d Jon breathed, surprised. \u201cSo you came inside after all, eh?\u201d The white wolf often hunted all night; he had not expected to see him again till daybreak. \u201cWas the hunting so bad?\u201d he asked. \u201cHere. To me, Ghost.\u201d\nThe direwolf circled the fire, sniffing Jon, sniffing the wind, never still. It did not seem as if he were after meat right now. When the dead came walking, Ghost knew. He woke me, warned me. Alarmed, he got to his feet. \u201cis something out there? Ghost, do you have a scent?\u201d Dywen said he smelled cold.\nThe direwolf loped off, stopped, looked back. He wants me to follow. Pulling up the hood of his cloak, Jon walked away from the tents, away from the warmth of his fire, past the lines of shaggy little garrons. One of the horses whickered nervously when Ghost padded by. Jon soothed him with a word and paused to stroke his muzzle. He could hear the wind whistling through cracks in the rocks as they neared the ringwall. A voice called out a challenge. Jon stepped into the torchlight. \u201cI need to fetch water for the Lord Commander.\u201d\n\u201cGo on, then,\u201d the guard said. \u201cBe quick about it.\u201d Huddled beneath his black cloak, with his hood drawn up against the wind, the man never even looked to see if he had a bucket.\nJon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while Ghost slid beneath them. A torch had been thrust down into a crevice, its flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came. He snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones. Ghost went racing down the hill. Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before him as he made his descent. The camp sounds faded behind him. The night was black, the slope steep, stony, and uneven. A moment\u2019s inattention would be a sure way to break an ankle\u2026 or his neck. What am I doing? he asked himself as he picked his way down.\nThe trees stood beneath him, warriors armored in bark and leaf, deployed in their silent ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill. Black, they seemed\u2026 it was only when his torchlight brushed against them that Jon glimpsed a flash of green. Faintly, he heard the sound of water flowing over rocks. Ghost vanished in the underbrush. Jon struggled after him, listening to the call of the brook, to the leaves sighing in the wind. Branches clutched at his cloak, while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars.\nHe found Ghost lapping from the stream. \u201cGhost,\u201d he called, \u201cto me. Now.\u201d When the direwolf raised his head, his eyes glowed red and baleful, and water streamed down from his jaws like slaver. There was something fierce and terrible about him in that instant. And then he was off, bounding past Jon, racing through the trees. \u201cGhost, no, stay,\u201d he shouted, but the wolf paid no heed. The lean white shape was swallowed by the dark, and Jon had only two choices\u2014to climb the hill again, alone, or to follow.\nHe followed, angry, holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to trip him with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab as his feet, the holes where a man could twist an ankle. Every few feet he called again for Ghost, but the night wind was swirling amongst the trees and it drank the words. This is madness, he thought as he plunged deeper into the trees. He was about to turn back when he glimpsed a flash of white off ahead and to the right, back toward the hill. He jogged after it, cursing under his breath.\nA quarter way around the Fist he chased the wolf before he lost him again. Finally he stopped to catch his breath amidst the scrub, thorns, and tumbled rocks at the base of the hill. Beyond the torchlight, the dark pressed close.\nA soft scrabbling noise made him turn. Jon moved toward the sound, stepping carefully among boulders and thornbushes. Behind a fallen tree, he came on Ghost again. The direwolf was digging furiously, kicking up dirt.\n\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Jon lowered the torch, revealing a rounded mound of soft earth. A grave, he thought. But whose?\nHe knelt, jammed the torch into the ground beside him. The soil was loose, sandy. Jon pulled it out by the fistful. There were no stones, no roots. Whatever was here had been put here recently. Two feet down, his fingers touched cloth. He had been expecting a corpse, fearing a corpse, but this was something else. He pushed against the fabric and felt small, hard shapes beneath, unyielding. There was no smell, no sign of graveworms. Ghost backed off and sat on his haunches, watching.\nJon brushed the loose soil away to reveal a rounded bundle perhaps two feet across. He jammed his fingers down around the edges and worked it loose. When he pulled it free, whatever was inside shifted and clinked. Treasure, he thought, but the shapes were wrong to be coins, and the sound was wrong for metal.\nA length of frayed rope bound the bundle together. Jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it, groped for the edges of the cloth, and pulled. The bundle turned, and its contents spilled out onto the ground, glittering dark and bright. He saw a dozen knives, leaf-shaped spearheads, numerous arrowheads. Jon picked up a dagger blade, featherlight and shiny black, hiltless. Torchlight ran along its edge, a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness. Dragonglass. What the maesters call obsidian. Had Ghost uncovered some ancient cache of the children of the forest, buried here for thousands of years? The Fist of the First Men was an old place, only\u2026\nBeneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn, made from an auroch\u2019s horn and banded in bronze. Jon shook the dirt from inside it, and a stream of arrowheads fell out. He let them fall, and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing it between his fingers. Good wool, thick, a double weave, damp but not rotted. It could not have been long in the ground. And it was dark. He seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch. Not dark. Black.\nEven before Jon stood and shook it out, he knew what he had: the black cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch.",

      "content": "Bran\nAlebelly found him in the forge, working the bellows for Mikken. \u201cMaester wants you in the turret, m\u2019lord prince. There\u2019s been a bird from the king.\u201d\n\u201cFrom Robb?\u201d Excited, Bran did not wait for Hodor, but let Alebelly carry him up the steps. He was a big man, though not so big as Hodor and nowhere near as strong. By the time they reached the maester\u2019s turret he was red-faced and puffing. Rickon was there before them, and both Walder Freys as well.\nMaester Luwin sent Alebelly away and closed his door. \u201cMy lords,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cwe have had a message from His Grace, with both good news and ill. He has won a great victory in the west, shattering a Lannister army at a place named Oxcross, and has taken several castles as well. He writes us from Ashemark, formerly the stronghold of House Marbrand.\u201d\nRickon tugged at the maester\u2019s robe. \u201cIs Robb coming home?\u201d\n\u201cNot just yet, I fear. There are battles yet to fight.\u201d\n\u201cWas it Lord Tywin he defeated?\u201d asked Bran.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the maester. \u201cSer Stafford Lannister commanded the enemy host. He was slain in the battle.\u201d\nBran had never even heard of Ser Stafford Lannister. He found himself agreeing with Big Walder when he said, \u201cLord Tywin is the only one who matters.\u201d\n\u201cTell Robb I want him to come home,\u201d said Rickon. \u201cHe can bring his wolf home too, and Mother and Father.\u201d Though he knew Lord Eddard was dead, sometimes Rickon forgot\u2026 willfully, Bran suspected. His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be.\nBran was glad for Robb\u2019s victory, but disquieted as well. He remembered what Osha had said the day that his brother had led his army out Of Winterfell. He\u2019s marching the wrong way, the wildling woman had insisted.\n\u201cSadly, no victory is without cost.\u201d Maester Luwin turned to the Walders. \u201cMy lords, your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross. He took a wound in the battle, Robb writes. It was not thought to be serious, but three days later he died in his tent, asleep.\u201d\nBig Walder shrugged. \u201cHe was very old. Five-and-sixty, I think. Too old for battles. He was always saying he was tired.\u201d\nLittle Walder hooted. \u201cTired of waiting for our grandfather to die, you mean. Does this mean Ser Emmon\u2019s the heir now?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d his cousin said. \u201cThe sons of the first son come before the second son. Ser Ryman is next in line, and then Edwyn and Black Walder and Petyr Pimple. And then Aegon and all his sons.\u201d\n\u201cRyman is old too,\u201d said Little Walder. \u201cPast forty, I bet. And he has a bad belly. Do you think he\u2019ll be lord?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be lord. I don\u2019t care if he is.\u201d\nMaester Luwin cut in sharply. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of such talk, my lords. Where is your grief? Your uncle is dead.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Little Walder. \u201cWe\u2019re very sad.\u201d\nThey weren\u2019t, though. Bran got a sick feeling in his belly. They like the taste of this dish better than I do. He asked Maester Luwin to be excused.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d The maester rang for help. Hodor must have been busy in the stables. It was Osha who came. She was stronger than Alebelly, though, and had no trouble lifting Bran in her arms and carrying him down the steps.\n\u201cOsha,\u201d Bran asked as they crossed the yard. \u201cDo you know the way north? To the Wall and\u2026 and even past?\u201d\n\u201cThe way\u2019s easy. Look for the Ice Dragon, and chase the blue star in the rider\u2019s eye.\u201d She backed through a door and started up the winding steps.\n\u201cAnd there are still giants there, and\u2026 the rest\u2026 the Others, and the children of the forest too?\u201d\n\u201cThe giants I\u2019ve seen, the children I\u2019ve heard tell of, and the white walkers\u2026 why do you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever see a three-eyed crow?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t say I\u2019d want to.\u201d Osha kicked open the door to his bedchamber and set him in his window seat, where he could watch the yard below.\nIt seemed only a few heartbeats after she took her leave that the door opened again, and Jojen Reed entered unbidden, with his sister Meera behind him. \u201cYou heard about the bird?\u201d Bran asked. The other boy nodded. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a supper like you said. It was a letter from Robb, and we didn\u2019t eat it, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe green dreams take strange shapes sometimes,\u201d Jojen admitted. \u201cThe truth of them is not always easy to understand.\u201d\n\u201cTell me the bad thing you dreamed,\u201d Bran said. \u201cThe bad thing that is coming to Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cDoes my lord prince believe me now? Will he trust my words, no matter how queer they sound in his ears?\u201d\nBran nodded.\n\u201cIt is the sea that comes.\u201d\n\u201cThe sea?\u201d\n\u201cI dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell. I saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers, and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard. When I first dreamed the dream, back at Greywater, I didn\u2019t know their faces, but now I do. That Alebelly is one, the guard who called our names at the feast. Your septon\u2019s another. Your smith as well.\u201d\n\u201cMikken?\u201d Bran was as confused as he was dismayed. \u201cBut the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues away, and Winterfell\u2019s walls are so high the water couldn\u2019t get in even if it did come.\u201d\n\u201cIn the dark of night the salt sea will flow over these walls,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cI saw the dead, bloated and drowned.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to tell them,\u201d Bran said. \u201cAlebelly and Mikken, and Septon Chayle. Tell them not to drown.\u201d\n\u201cIt will not save them,\u201d replied the boy in green.\nMeera came to the window seat and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThey will not believe, Bran. No more than you did.\u201d\nJojen sat on Bran\u2019s bed. \u201cTell me what you dream.\u201d\nHe was scared, even then, but he had sworn to trust them, and a Stark of Winterfell keeps his sworn word. \u201cThere\u2019s different kinds,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s the wolf dreams, those aren\u2019t so bad as the others. I run and hunt and kill squirrels. And there\u2019s dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly. Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too, calling my name. That frightens me. But the worst dreams are when I fall.\u201d He looked down into the yard, feeling miserable. \u201cI never used to fall before. When I climbed. I went everyplace, up on the roofs and along the walls, I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower. Mother was afraid that I would fall but I knew I never would. Only I did, and now when I sleep I fall all the time.\u201d\nMeera gave his shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIs that all?\u201d\n\u201cI guess.\u201d\n\u201cWarg,\u201d said Jojen Reed.\nBran looked at him, his eyes wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWarg. Shapechanger. Beastling. That is what they will call you, if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams.\u201d\nThe names made him afraid again. \u201cWho will call me?\u201d\n\u201cYour own folk. In fear. Some will hate you if they know what you are. Some will even try to kill you.\u201d\nOld Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes. In the stories they were always evil. \u201cI\u2019m not like that,\u201d Bran said. \u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s only dreams.\u201d\n\u201cThe wolf dreams are no true dreams. You have your eye closed tight whenever you\u2019re awake, but as you drift off it flutters open and your soul seeks out its other half. The power is strong in you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it. I want to be a knight.\u201d\n\u201cA knight is what you want. A warg is what you are. You can\u2019t change that, Bran, you can\u2019t deny it or push it away. You are the winged wolf, but you will never fly.\u201d Jojen got up and walked to the window. \u201cUnless you open your eye.\u201d He put two fingers together and poked Bran in the forehead, hard.\nWhen he raised his hand to the spot, Bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin. There was no eye, not even a closed one. \u201cHow can I open it if it\u2019s not there?\u201d\n\u201cYou will never find the eye with your fingers, Bran. You must search with your heart.\u201d Jojen studied Bran\u2019s face with those strange green eyes. \u201cOr are you afraid?\u201d\n\u201cMaester Luwin says there\u2019s nothing in dreams that a man need fear.\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d said Jojen.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe past. The future. The truth.\u201d\nThey left him more muddled than ever. When he was alone, Bran tried to open his third eye, but he didn\u2019t know how. No matter how he wrinkled his forehead and poked at it, he couldn\u2019t see any different than he\u2019d done before. In the days that followed, he tried to warn others about what Jojen had seen, but it didn\u2019t go as he wanted. Mikken thought it was funny. \u201cThe sea, is it? Happens I always wanted to see the sea. Never got where I could go to it, though. So now it\u2019s coming to me, is it? The gods are good, to take such trouble for a poor smith.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods will take me when they see fit,\u201d Septon Chayle said quietly, \u201cthough I scarcely think it likely that I\u2019ll drown, Bran. I grew up on the banks of the White Knife, you know. I\u2019m quite the strong swimmer.\u201d\nAlebelly was the only one who paid the warning any heed. He went to talk to Jojen himself, and afterward stopped bathing and refused to go near the well. Finally he stank so bad that six of the other guards threw him into a tub of scalding water and scrubbed him raw while he screamed that they were going to drown him like the frogboy had said. Thereafter he scowled whenever he saw Bran or Jojen about the castle, and muttered under his breath.\nIt was a few days after Alebelly\u2019s bath that Ser Rodrik returned to Winterfell with his prisoner, a fleshy young man with fat moist lips and long hair who smelled like a privy, even worse than Alebelly had. \u201cReek, he\u2019s called,\u201d Hayhead said when Bran asked who it was. \u201cI never heard his true name. He served the Bastard of Bolton and helped him murder Lady Hornwood, they say.\u201d\nThe Bastard himself was dead, Bran learned that evening over supper. Ser Rodrik\u2019s men had caught him on Hornwood land doing something horrible (Bran wasn\u2019t quite sure what, but it seemed to be something you did without your clothes) and shot him down with arrows as he tried to ride away. They came too late for poor Lady Hornwood, though. After their wedding, the Bastard had locked her in a tower and neglected to feed her. Bran had heard men saying that when Ser Rodrik had smashed down the door he found her with her mouth all bloody and her fingers chewed off.\n\u201cThe monster has tied us a thorny knot,\u201d the old knight told Maester Luwin. \u201cLike it or no, Lady Hornwood was his wife. He made her say the vows before both septon and heart tree, and bedded her that very night before witnesses. She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her seal to it.\u201d\n\u201cVows made at sword point are not valid,\u201d the maester argued.\n\u201cRoose Bolton may not agree. Not with land at issue.\u201d Ser Rodrik looked unhappy. \u201cWould that I could take this serving man\u2019s head off as well, he\u2019s as bad as his master. But I fear I must keep him alive until Robb returns from his wars. He is the only witness to the worst of the Bastard\u2019s crimes. Perhaps when Lord Bolton hears his tale, he will abandon his claim, but meantime we have Manderly knights and Dreadfort men killing one another in Hornwood forests, and I lack the strength to stop them.\u201d The old knight turned in his seat and gave Bran a stern look. \u201cAnd what have you been about while I\u2019ve been away, my lord prince? Commanding our guardsmen not to wash? Do you want them smelling like this Reek, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cThe sea is coming here,\u201d Bran said. \u201cJojen saw it in a green dream. Alebelly is going to drown.\u201d\nMaester Luwin tugged at his chain collar. \u201cThe Reed boy believes he sees the future in his dreams, Ser Rodrik. I\u2019ve spoken to Bran about the uncertainty of such prophecies, but if truth be told, there is trouble along the Stony Shore. Raiders in longships, plundering fishing villages. Raping and burning. Leobald Tallhart has sent his nephew Benfred to deal with them, but I expect they\u2019ll take to their ships and flee at the first sight of armed men.\u201d\n\u201cAye, and strike somewhere else. The Others take all such cowards. They would never dare, no more than the Bastard of Bolton, if our main strength were not a thousand leagues south.\u201d Ser Rodrik looked at Bran. \u201cWhat else did the lad tell you?\u201d\n\u201cHe said the water would flow over our walls. He saw Alebelly drowned, and Mikken and Septon Chayle too.\u201d\nSer Rodrik frowned. \u201cWell, should it happen that I need to ride against these raiders myself, I shan\u2019t take Alebelly, then. He didn\u2019t see me drowned, did he? No? Good.\u201d\nIt heartened Bran to hear that. Maybe they won\u2019t drown, then, he thought. If they stay away from the sea.\nMeera thought so too, later that night when she and Joien met Bran in his room to play a three-sided game of tiles, but her brother shook his head. \u201cThe things I see in green dreams can\u2019t be changed.\u201d\nThat made his sister angry. \u201cWhy would the gods send a warning if we can\u2019t heed it and change what\u2019s to come?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Joien said sadly.\n\u201cIf you were Alebelly, you\u2019d probably jump into the well to have done with it! He should fight, and Bran should too.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Bran felt suddenly afraid. \u201cWhat should I fight? Am I going to drown too?\u201d\nMeera looked at him guiltily. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said\u2026\u201d\nHe could tell that she was hiding something. \u201cDid you see me in a green dream?\u201d he asked Jojen nervously. \u201cWas I drowned?\u201d\n\u201cNot drowned.\u201d Jojen spoke as if every word pained him. \u201cI dreamed of the man who came today, the one they call Reek. You and your brother lay dead at his feet, and he was skinning off your faces with a long red blade.\u201d\nMeera rose to her feet. \u201cIf I went to the dungeon, I could drive a spear right through his heart. How could he murder Bran if he was dead?\u201d\n\u201cThe gaolers will stop you,\u201d Joien said. \u201cThe guards. And if you tell them why you want him dead, they\u2019ll never believe.\u201d\n\u201cI have guards too,\u201d Bran reminded them. \u201cAlebelly and Poxy Tym and Hayhead and the rest.\u201d\nJojen\u2019s mossy eyes were full of pity. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to stop him, Bran. I couldn\u2019t see why, but I saw the end of it. I saw you and Rickon in your crypts, down in the dark with all the dead kings and their stone wolves.\u201d\nNo, Bran thought. No. \u201cIf I went away\u2026 to Greywater, or to the crow, someplace far where they couldn\u2019t find me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt will not matter. The dream was green, Bran, and the green dreams do not lie.\u201d",

      "content": "Tyrion\nVrys stood over the brazier, warming his soft hands. \u201cIt would appear Renly was murdered most fearfully in the very midst of his army. His throat was opened from ear to ear by a blade that passed through steel and bone as if they were soft cheese.\u201d\n\u201cMurdered by whose hand?\u201d Cersei demanded.\n\u201cHave you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all? My informers are not always as highly placed as we might like. When a king dies, fancies sprout like mushrooms in the dark. A groom says that Renly was slain by a knight of his own Rainbow Guard. A washerwoman claims Stannis stole through the heart of his brother\u2019s army with his magic sword. Several men-at-arms believe a woman did the fell deed, but cannot agree on which woman. A maid that Renly had spurned, claims one. A camp follower brought in to serve his pleasure on the eve of battle, says a second. The third ventures that it might have been the Lady Catelyn Stark.\u201d\nThe queen was not pleased. \u201cMust you waste our time with every rumor the fools care to tell?\u201d\n\u201cYou pay me well for these rumors, my gracious queen.\u201d\n\u201cWe pay you for the truth, Lord Varys. Remember that, or this small council may grow smaller still.\u201d\nVarys tittered nervously. \u201cYou and your noble brother will leave His Grace with no council at all if you continue.\u201d\n\u201cI daresay, the realm could survive a few less councillors,\u201d said Littlefinger with a smile.\n\u201cDear dear Petyr,\u201d said Varys, \u201care you not concerned that yours might be the next name on the Hand\u2019s little list?\u201d\n\u201cBefore you, Varys? I should never dream of it.\u201d\n\u201cMayhaps we will be brothers on the Wall together, you and I.\u201d Varys giggled again.\n\u201cSooner than you\u2019d like, if the next words out of your mouth are not something useful, eunuch.\u201d From the look of her eyes, Cersei was prepared to castrate Varys all over again.\n\u201cMight this be some ruse?\u201d asked Littlefinger.\n\u201cIf so, it is a ruse of surpassing cleverness,\u201d said Varys. \u201cIt has certainly hoodwinked me.\u201d\nTyrion had heard enough. \u201cJoff will be so disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was saving such a nice spike for Renly\u2019s head. But whoever did the deed, we must assume Stannis was behind it. The gain is clearly his.\u201d He did not like this news; he had counted on the brothers Baratheon decimating each other in bloody battle. He could feel his elbow throbbing where the morningstar had laid it open. It did that sometimes in the damp. He squeezed it uselessly in his hand and asked, \u201cWhat of Renly\u2019s host?\u201d\n\u201cThe greater part of his foot remains at Bitterbridge.\u201d Varys abandoned the brazier to take his seat at the table. \u201cMost of the lords who rode with Lord Renly to Storm\u2019s End have gone over banner-and-blade to Stannis, with all their chivalry.\u201d\n\u201cLed by the Florents, I\u2019d wager,\u201d said Littlefinger.\nVarys gave him a simpering smile. \u201cYou would win, my lord. Lord Alester was indeed the first to bend the knee. Many others followed.\u201d\n\u201cMany,\u201d Tyrion said pointedly, \u201cbut not all?\u201d\n\u201cNot all,\u201d agreed the eunuch. \u201cNot Loras Tyrell, nor Randyll Tarly, nor Mathis Rowan. And Storm\u2019s End itself has not yielded. Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly\u2019s name, and will not believe his liege is dead. He demands to see the mortal remains before he opens his gates, but it seems that Renly\u2019s corpse has unaccountably vanished. Carried away, most likely. A fifth of Renly\u2019s knights departed with Ser Loras rather than bend the knee to Stannis. It\u2019s said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw his king\u2019s body, and slew three of Renly\u2019s guards in his wrath, among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce.\u201d\nA pity he stopped at three, thought Tyrion.\n\u201cSer Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge,\u201d Varys went on. \u201cHis sister is there, Renly\u2019s queen, as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless. Which side will they take now? A ticklish question. Many serve the lords who remained at Storm\u2019s End, and those lords now belong to Stannis.\u201d\nTyrion leaned forward. \u201cThere is a chance here, it seems to me. Win Loras Tyrell to our cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well. They may have sworn their swords to Stannis for the moment, yet they cannot love the man, or they would have been his from the start.\u201d\n\u201cIs their love for us any greater?\u201d asked Cersei.\n\u201cScarcely,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cThey loved Renly, clearly, but Renly is slain. Perhaps we can give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer Joffrey to Stannis\u2026 if we move quickly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of reasons do you mean to give them?\u201d\n\u201cGold reasons,\u201d Littlefinger suggested at once.\nVarys made a tsking sound. \u201cSweet Petyr, surely you do not mean to suggest that these puissant lords and noble knights could be bought like so many chickens in the market.\u201d\n\u201cHave you been to our markets of late, Lord Varys?\u201d asked Littlefinger. \u201cYou\u2019d find it easier to buy a lord than a chicken, I daresay. Of course, lords cluck prouder than chickens, and take it ill if you offer them coin like a tradesman, but they are seldom adverse to taking gifts\u2026 honors, lands, castles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBribes might sway some of the lesser lords,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201cbut never Highgarden.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Littlefinger admitted. \u201cThe Knight of Flowers is the key there. Mace Tyrell has two older sons, but Loras has always been his favorite. Win him, and Highgarden will be yours.\u201d\nYes, Tyrion thought. \u201cIt seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly. We can win the Tyrell alliance as he did. With a marriage.\u201d\nVarys understood the quickest. \u201cYou think to wed King Joffrey to Margaery Tyrell.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Renly\u2019s young queen was no more than fifteen, sixteen, he seemed to recall\u2026 older than Joffrey, but a few years were nothing, it was so neat and sweet he could taste it.\n\u201cJoffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark,\u201d Cersei objected.\n\u201cMarriage contracts can be broken. What advantage is there in wedding the king to the daughter of a dead traitor?\u201d\nLittlefinger spoke up. \u201cYou might point out to His Grace that the Tyrells are much wealthier than the Starks, and that Margaery is said to be lovely\u2026 and beddable besides.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cJoff ought to like that well enough.\u201d\n\u201cMy son is too young to care about such things.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d asked Tyrion. \u201cHe\u2019s thirteen, Cersei. The same age at which I married.\u201d\n\u201cYou shamed us all with that sorry episode. Joffrey is made of finer stuff.\u201d\n\u201cSo fine that he had Ser Boros rip off Sansa\u2019s gown.\u201d\n\u201cHe was angry with the girl.\u201d\n\u201cHe was angry with that cook\u2019s boy who spilled the soup last night as well, but he didn\u2019t strip him naked.\u201d\n\u201cThis was not a matter of some spilled soup\u2014\u201d\nNo, it was a matter of some pretty teats. After that business in the yard, Tyrion had spoken with Varys about how they might arrange for Joffrey to visit Chataya\u2019s. A taste of honey might sweeten the boy, he hoped. He might even be grateful, gods forbid, and Tyrion could do with a shade more gratitude from his sovereign. It would need to be done secretly, of course. The tricky bit would be parting him from the Hound. \u201cThe dog is never far from his master\u2019s heels,\u201d he\u2019d observed to Varys, \u201cbut all men sleep. And some gamble and whore and visit winesinks as well.\u201d\n\u201cThe Hound does all these things, if that is your question.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cMy question is when.\u201d\nVarys had laid a finger on his cheek, smiling enigmatically. \u201cMy lord, a suspicious man might think you wished to find a time when Sandor Clegane was not protecting King Joffrey, the better to do the boy some harm.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you know me better than that, Lord Varys,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cWhy, all I want is for Joffrey to love me.\u201d\nThe eunuch had promised to look into the matter. The war made its own demands, though; Joffrey\u2019s initiation into manhood would need to wait. \u201cDoubtless you know your son better than I do,\u201d he made himself tell Cersei, \u201cbut regardless, there\u2019s still much to be said for a Tyrell marriage. It may be the only way that Joffrey lives long enough to reach his wedding night.\u201d\nLittlefinger agreed. \u201cThe Stark girl brings Joffrey nothing but her body, sweet as that may be. Margaery Tyrell brings fifty thousand swords and all the strength of Highgarden.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Varys laid a soft hand on the queen\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou have a mother\u2019s heart, and I know His Grace loves his little sweetling. Yet kings must learn to put the needs of the realm before their own desires. I say this offer must be made.\u201d\nThe queen pulled free of the eunuch\u2019s touch. \u201cYou would not speak so if you were women. Say what you will, my lords, but Joffrey is too proud to settle for Renly\u2019s leavings. He will never consent.\u201d\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cWhen the king comes of age in three years, he may give or withhold his consent as he pleases. Until then, you are his regent and I am his Hand, and he will marry whomever we tell him to marry. Leavings or no.\u201d\nCersei\u2019s quiver was empty. \u201cMake your offer then, but gods save you all if Joff does not like this girl.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so pleased we can agree,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cNow, which of us shall go to Bitterbridge? We must reach Ser Loras with our offer before his blood can cool.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to send one of the council?\u201d\n\u201cI can scarcely expect the Knight of Flowers to treat with Bronn or Shagga, can I? The Tyrells are proud.\u201d\nHis sister wasted no time trying to twist the situation to her advantage. \u201cSer Jacelyn Bywater is nobly born. Send him.\u201d\nTyrion shook his head. \u201cWe need someone who can do more than repeat our words and fetch back a reply. Our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly.\u201d\n\u201cThe Hand speaks with the king\u2019s voice.\u201d Candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in Cersei\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf we send you, Tyrion, it will be as if Joffrey went himself. And who better, You wield words as skillfully as Jaime wields a sword.\u201d\nAre you that eager to get me out of the city, Cersei? \u201cYou are too kind, sister, but it seems to me that a boy\u2019s mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle. And you have a gift for winning friends that I could never hope to match.\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cJoff needs me at his side.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace, my lord Hand,\u201d said Littlefinger, \u201cthe king needs both of you here. Let me go in your stead.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d What gain does he see in this? Tyrion wondered.\n\u201cI am of the king\u2019s council, yet not the king\u2019s blood, so I would make a poor hostage. I knew Ser Loras passing well when he was here at court, and gave him no cause to mislike me. Mace Tyrell bears me no enmity that I know of, and I flatter myself that I am not unskilled in negotiation.\u201d\nHe has us. Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish, nor did he want the man out of his sight, yet what other choice was left him? It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself, and he knew full well that if he left King\u2019s Landing for any length of time, all that he had managed to accomplish would be undone. \u201cThere is fighting between here and Bitterbridge,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cAnd you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brother\u2019s wayward lambs.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been frightened of shepherds. It\u2019s the sheep who trouble me. Still, I suppose an escort might be in order.\u201d\n\u201cI can spare a hundred gold cloaks,\u201d Tyrion said.\n\u201cFive hundred.\u201d\n\u201cThree hundred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd forty more\u2014twenty knights with as many squires. If I arrive without a knightly tail, the Tyrells will think me of small account.\u201d\nThat was true enough. \u201cAgreed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll include Horror and Slobber in my party, and send them on to their lord father afterward. A gesture of goodwill. We need Paxter Redwyne, he\u2019s Mace Tyrell\u2019s oldest friend, and a great power in his own right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a traitor,\u201d the queen said, balking. \u201cThe Arbor would have declared for Renly with all the rest, except that Redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it.\u201d\n\u201cRenly is dead, Your Grace,\u201d Littlefinger pointed out, \u201cand neither Stannis nor Lord Paxter will have forgotten how Redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of Storm\u2019s End. Restore the twins and perchance we may win Redwyne\u2019s love.\u201d\nCersei remained unconvinced. \u201cThe Others can keep his love, I want his swords and sails. Holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that we\u2019ll have them.\u201d\nTyrion had the answer. \u201cThen let us send Ser Hobber back to the Arbor and keep Ser Horas here. Lord Paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that, I should think.\u201d\nThe suggestion was carried without protest, but Littlefinger was not done. \u201cWe\u2019ll want horses. Swift and strong. The fighting will make remounts hard to come by. A goodly supply of gold will also be needed, for those gifts we spoke of earlier.\u201d\n\u201cTake as much as you require. If the city falls, Stannis will steal it all anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll want my commission in writing. A document that will leave Mace Tyrell in no doubt as to my authority, granting me full power to treat with him concerning this match and any other arrangements that might be required, and to make binding pledges in the king\u2019s name. It should be signed by Joffrey and every member of this council, and bear all our seals.\u201d\nTyrion shifted uncomfortably. \u201cDone. Will that be all? I remind you, there\u2019s a long road between here and Bitterbridge.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be riding it before dawn breaks.\u201d Littlefinger rose. \u201cI trust that on my return, the king will see that I am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause?\u201d\nVarys giggled. \u201cJoffrey is such a grateful sovereign, I\u2019m certain you will have no cause to complain, my good brave lord.\u201d\nThe queen was more direct. \u201cWhat do you want, Petyr?\u201d\nLittlefinger glanced at Tyrion with a sly smile. \u201cI shall need to give that some consideration. No doubt I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d He sketched an airy bow and took his leave, as casual as if he were off to one of his brothels.\nTyrion glanced out the window. The fog was so thick that he could not even see the curtain wall across the yard. A few dim lights shone indistinct through that greyness. A foul day for travel, he thought. He did not envy Petyr Baelish. \u201cWe had best see to drawing up those documents. Lord Varys, send for parchment and quill. And someone will need to wake Joffrey.\u201d\nIt was still grey and dark when the meeting finally ended. Varys scurried off alone, his soft slippers whisking along the floor. The Lannisters lingered a moment by the door. \u201cHow comes your chain, brother?\u201d the queen asked as Ser Preston fastened a vair-lined cloth-of-silver cloak about her shoulders.\n\u201cLink by link, it grows longer. We should thank the gods that Ser Cortnay Penrose is as stubborn as he is. Stannis will never march north with Storm\u2019s End untaken in his rear.\u201d\n\u201cTyrion, I know we do not always agree on policy, but it seems to me that I was wrong about you. You are not so big a fool as I imagined. In truth, I realize now that you have been a great help. For that I thank you. You must forgive me if I have spoken to you harshly in the past.\u201d\n\u201cMust I?\u201d He gave her a shrug, a smile. \u201cSweet sister, you have said nothing that requires forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cToday, you mean?\u201d They both laughed\u2026 and Cersei leaned over and planted a quick, soft kiss on his brow.\nToo astonished for words, Tyrion could only watch her stride off down the hall, Ser Preston at her side. \u201cHave I lost my wits, or did my sister just kiss me?\u201d he asked Bronn when she was gone.\n\u201cWas it so sweet?\u201d\n\u201cIt was\u2026 unanticipated.\u201d Cersei had been behaving queerly of late. Tyrion found it very unsettling. \u201cI am trying to recall the last time she kissed me. I could not have been more than six or seven. Jaime had dared her to do it.\u201d\n\u201cThe woman\u2019s finally taken note of your charms.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cNo, the woman is hatching something. Best find out what, Bronn. You know I hate surprises.\u201d",

      "content": "Theon\nTheon wiped the spittle off his cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cRobb will gut you, Greyjoy,\u201d Benfred Tallheart screamed. \u201cHe\u2019ll feed your turncloak\u2019s heart to his wolf, you piece of sheep dung.\u201d\nAeron Damphair\u2019s voice cut through the insults like a sword through cheese. \u201cNow you must kill him.\u201d\n\u201cI have questions for him first,\u201d said Theon.\n\u201cFuck your questions.\u201d Benfred hung bleeding and helpless between Stygg and Werlag. \u201cYou\u2019ll choke on them before you get any answers from me, craven. Turncloak.\u201d\nUncle Aeron was relentless. \u201cWhen he spits on you, he spits on all of us. He spits on the Drowned God. He must die.\u201d\n\u201cMy father gave me the command here, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd sent me to counsel you.\u201d\nAnd to watch me. Theon dare not push matters too far with his uncle. The command was his, yes, but his men had a faith in the Drowned God that they did not have in him, and they were terrified of Aeron Damphair. I cannot fault them for that.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll lose your head for this, Greyjoy. The crows will eat the jelly of your eyes.\u201d Benfred tried to spit again, but only managed a little blood. \u201cThe Others bugger your wet god.\u201d\nTallhart, you\u2019ve spit away your life, Theon thought. \u201cStygg, silence him,\u201d he said.\nThey forced Benfred to his knees. Werlag tore the rabbitskin off his belt and jammed it between his teeth to stop his shouting. Stygg unlimbered his axe.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aeron Damphair declared. \u201cHe must be given to the god. The old way.\u201d\nWhat does it matter? Dead is dead. \u201cTake him, then.\u201d\n\u201cYou will come as well. You command here. The offering should come from you.\u201d\nThat was more than Theon could stomach. \u201cYou are the priest, Uncle, I leave the god to you. Do me the same kindness and leave the battles to me.\u201d He waved his hand, and Werlag and Stygg began to drag their captive off toward the shore. Aeron Damphair gave his nephew a reproachful look, then followed. Down to the pebbled beach they would go, to drown Benfred Tallhart in salt water. The old way.\nPerhaps it\u2019s a kindness, Theon told himself as he stalked off in the other direction. Stygg was hardly the most expert of headsmen, and Benfred had a neck thick as a boar\u2019s, heavy with muscle and fat. I used to mock him for it, just to see how angry I could make him, he remembered. That had been, what, three years past? When Ned Stark had ridden to Torrhen\u2019s Square to see Ser Helman, Theon had accompanied him and spent a fortnight in Benfred\u2019s company.\nHe could hear the rough noises of victory from the crook in the road where the battle had been fought\u2026 if you\u2019d go so far as to call it a battle. More like slaughtering sheep, if truth be told. Sheep fleeced in steel, but sheep nonetheless.\nClimbing a jumble of stone, Theon looked down on the dead men and dying horses. The horses had deserved better. Tymor and his brothers had gathered up what mounts had come through the fight unhurt, while Urzen and Black Lorren silenced the animals too badly wounded to be saved. The rest of his men were looting the corpses. Gevin Harlaw knelt on a dead man\u2019s chest, sawing off his finger to get at a ring. Paying the iron price. My lord father would approve. Theon thought of seeking out the bodies of the two men he\u2019d slain himself to see if they had any jewelry worth the taking, but the notion left a bitter taste in his mouth. He could imagine what Eddard Stark would have said. Yet that thought made him angry too. Stark is dead and rotting, and naught to me, he reminded himself.\nOld Botley, who was called Fishwhiskers, sat scowling by his pile of plunder while his three sons added to it. One of them was in a shoving match with a fat man named Todric, who was reeling among the slain with a horn of ale in one hand and an axe in the other, clad in a cloak of white foxfur only slightly stained by the blood of its previous owner. Drunk, Theon decided, watching him bellow. It was said that the ironmen of old had oft been blood-drunk in battle, so berserk that they felt no pain and feared no foe, but this was a common ale-drunk.\n\u201cWex, my bow and quiver.\u201d The boy ran and fetched them. Theon bent the bow and slipped the string into its notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into his eyes. Fishwhiskers leapt up cursing, but Theon was quicker. He drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn, figuring to give them a shot to talk about, but Todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as he loosed. The arrow took him through the belly.\nThe looters stopped to gape. Theon lowered his bow. \u201cNo drunkards, I said, and no squabbles over plunder.\u201d On his knees, Todric was dying noisily. \u201cBotley, silence him.\u201d Fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey. They slit Todric\u2019s throat as he kicked feebly, and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead.\nNow they know I mean what I say. Lord Balon might have given him the command, but Theon knew that some of his men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when they looked at him. \u201cAnyone else have a thirst?\u201d No one replied. \u201cGood.\u201d He kicked at Benfred\u2019s fallen banner, clutched in the dead hand of the squire who\u2019d borne it. A rabbitskin had been tied below the flag. Why rabbitskins? he had meant to ask, but being spat on had made him forget his questions. He tossed his bow back to Wex and strode off, remembering how elated he\u2019d felt after the Whispering Wood, and wondering why this did not taste as sweet. Tallhart, you bloody overproud fool, you never even sent out a scout.\nThey\u2019d been joking and even singing as they\u2019d come on, the three trees of Tallhart streaming above them while rabbitskins flapped stupidly from the points of their lances. The archers concealed behind the gorse had spoiled the song with a rain of arrows, and Theon himself had led his men-at-arms out to finish the butcher\u2019s work with dagger, axe, and warhammer. He had ordered their leader spared for questioning.\nOnly he had not expected it to be Benfred Tallhart.\nHis limp body was being dragged from the surf when Theon returned to his Sea Bitch. The masts of his longships stood outlined against the sky along the pebbled beach. Of the fishing village, nothing remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained. The men had been put to the sword, all but a handful that Theon had allowed to flee to bring the word to Torrhen\u2019s Square. Their wives and daughters had been claimed for salt wives, those who were young enough and fair. The crones and the ugly ones had simply been raped and killed, or taken for thralls if they had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble.\nTheon had planned that attack as well, bringing his ships up to the shore in the chill darkness before the dawn and leaping from the prow with a longaxe in his hand to lead his men into the sleeping village. He did not like the taste of any of this, but what choice did he have?\nHis thrice-damned sister was sailing her Black Wind north even now, sure to win a castle of her own. Lord Balon had let no word of the hosting escape the Iron Islands, and Theon\u2019s bloody work along the Stony Shore would be put down to sea raiders out for plunder. The northmen would not realize their true peril, not until the hammers fell on Deepwood Motte and Moat Cailin. And after all is done and won, they will make songs for that bitch Asha, and forget that I was even here. That is, if he allowed it.\nDagmer Cleftjaw stood by the high carved prow of his longship, Foamdrinker. Theon had assigned him the task of guarding the ships; otherwise men would have called it Dagmer\u2019s victory, not his. A more prickly man might have taken that for a slight, but the Cleftjaw had only laughed.\n\u201cThe day is won,\u201d Dagmer called down. \u201cAnd yet you do not smile, boy. The living should smile, for the dead cannot.\u201d He smiled himself to show how it was done. It made for a hideous sight. Under a snowy white mane of hair, Dagmer Cleftjaw had the most gut-churning scar Theon had ever seen, the legacy of the longaxe that had near killed him as a boy. The blow had splintered his jaw, shattered his front teeth, and left him four lips where other men had but two. A shaggy beard covered his cheeks and neck, but the hair would not grow over the scar, so a shiny seam of puckered, twisted flesh divided his face like a crevasse through a snowfield. \u201cWe could hear them singing,\u201d the old warrior said. \u201cIt was a good song, and they sang it bravely.\u201d\n\u201cThey sang better than they fought. Harps would have done them as much good as their lances did.\u201d\n\u201cHow many men are lost?\u201d\n\u201cOf ours?\u201d Theon shrugged. \u201cTodric. I killed him for getting drunk and fighting over loot.\u201d\n\u201cSome men are born to be killed.\u201d A lesser man might have been afraid to show a smile as frightening as his, yet Dagmer grinned more often and more broadly than Lord Balon ever had.\nUgly as it was, that smile brought back a hundred memories. Theon had seen it often as a boy, when he\u2019d jumped a horse over a mossy wall, or flung an axe and split a target square. He\u2019d seen it when he blocked a blow from Dagmer\u2019s sword, when he put an arrow through a seagull on the wing, when he took the tiller in hand and guided a longship safely through a snarl of foaming rocks. He gave me more smiles than my father and Eddard Stark together. Even Robb\u2026 he ought to have won a smile the day he\u2019d saved Bran from that wildling, but instead he\u2019d gotten a scolding, as if he were some cook who\u2019d burned the stew.\n\u201cYou and I must talk, Uncle,\u201d Theon said. Dagmer was no true uncle, only a sworn man with perhaps a pinch of Greyjoy blood four or five lives back, and that from the wrong side of the blanket. Yet Theon had always called him uncle nonetheless.\n\u201cCome onto my deck, then.\u201d There were no m\u2019lords from Dagmer, not when he stood on his own deck. On the Iron Islands, every captain was a king aboard his own ship.\nHe climbed the plank to the deck of the Foamdrinker in four long strides, and Dagmer led him back to the cramped aft cabin, where the old man poured a horn of sour ale and offered Theon the same. He declined. \u201cWe did not capture enough horses. A few, but\u2026 well, I\u2019ll make do with what I have, I suppose. Fewer men means more glory.\u201d\n\u201cWhat need do we have of horses?\u201d Like most ironmen, Dagmer preferred to fight on foot or from the deck of a ship. \u201cHorses will only shit on our decks and get in our way.\u201d\n\u201cIf we sailed, yes,\u201d Theon admitted. \u201cI have another plan.\u201d He watched the other carefully to see how he would take that. Without the Cleftjaw he could not hope to succeed. Command or no, the men would never follow him if both Aeron and Dagmer opposed him, and he had no hope of winning over the sour-faced priest.\n\u201cYour lord father commanded us to harry the coast, no more.\u201d Eyes pale as sea foam watched Theon from under those shaggy white eyebrows. Was it disapproval he saw there, or a spark of interest? The latter, he thought\u2026 hoped\u2026\n\u201cYou are my father\u2019s man.\u201d\n\u201cHis best man, and always have been.\u201d\nPride, Theon thought. He is proud, I must use that, his pride will be the key. \u201cThere is no man in the Iron Islands half so skilled with spear or sword.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been too long away, boy. When you left, it was as you say, but I am grown old in Lord Greyjoy\u2019s service. The singers call Andrik best now. Andrik the Unsmiling, they name him. A giant of a man. He serves Lord Drumm of Old Wyk. And Black Lorren and Qarl the Maid are near as dread.\u201d\n\u201cThis Andrik may be a great fighter, but men do not fear him as they fear you.\u201d\n\u201cAye, that\u2019s so,\u201d Dagmer said. The fingers curled around the drinking horn were heavy with rings, gold and silver and bronze, set with chunks of sapphire and garnet and dragonglass. He had paid the iron price for every one, Theon knew.\n\u201cIf I had a man like you in my service, I should not waste him on this child\u2019s business of harrying and burning. This is no work for Lord Balon\u2019s best man\u2026\u201d\nDagmer\u2019s grin twisted his lips apart and showed the brown splinters of his teeth. \u201cNor for his trueborn son?\u201d He hooted. \u201cI know you too well, Theon. I saw you take your first step, helped you bend your first bow. \u2019Tis not me who feels wasted.\u201d\n\u201cBy rights I should have my sister\u2019s command,\u201d he admitted, uncomfortably aware of how peevish that sounded.\n\u201cYou take this business too hard, boy. It is only that your lord father does not know you. With your brothers dead and you taken by the wolves, your sister was his solace. He learned to rely on her, and she has never failed him.\u201d\n\u201cNor have I. The Starks knew my worth. I was one of Brynden Blackfish\u2019s picked scouts, and I charged with the first wave in the Whispering Wood. I was that close to crossing swords with the Kingslayer himself.\u201d Theon held his hands two feet apart. \u201cDaryn Hornwood came between us, and died for it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you tell me this?\u201d Dagmer asked. \u201cIt was me who put your first sword in your hand. I know you are no craven.\u201d\n\u201cDoes my father?\u201d\nThe hoary old warrior looked as if he had bitten into something he did not like the taste of. \u201cIt is only\u2026 Theon, the Boy Wolf is your friend, and these Starks had you for ten years.\u201d\n\u201cI am no Stark.\u201d Lord Eddard saw to that. \u201cI am a Greyjoy, and I mean to be my father\u2019s heir. How can I do that unless I prove myself with some great deed?\u201d\n\u201cYou are young. Other wars will come, and you shall do your great deeds. For now, we are commanded to harry the Stony Shore.\u201d\n\u201cLet my uncle Aeron see to it. I\u2019ll give him six ships, all but Foamdrinker and Sea Bitch, and he can burn and drown to his god\u2019s surfeit.\u201d\n\u201cThe command was given you, not Aeron Damphair.\u201d\n\u201cSo long as the harrying is done, what does it matter? No priest could do what I mean to, nor what I ask of you. I have a task that only Dagmer Cleftjaw can accomplish.\u201d\nDagmer took a long draught from his horn. \u201cTell me.\u201d\nHe is tempted, Theon thought. He likes this reaver\u2019s work no better than I do. \u201cIf my sister can take a castle, so can I.\u201d\n\u201cAsha has four or five times the men we do.\u201d\nTheon allowed himself a sly smile. \u201cBut we have four times the wits, and five times the courage.\u201d\n\u201cYour father\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014will thank me, when I hand him his kingdom. I mean to do a deed that the harpers will sing of for a thousand years.\u201d\nHe knew that would give Dagmer pause. A singer had made a song about the axe that cracked his jaw in half, and the old man loved to hear it. Whenever he was in his cups he would call for a reaving song, something loud and stormy that told of dead heroes and deeds of wild valor. His hair is white and his teeth are rotten, but he still has a taste for glory.\n\u201cWhat would my part be in this scheme of yours, boy?\u201d Dagmer Cleftjaw asked after a long silence, and Theon knew he had won.\n\u201cTo strike terror into the heart of the foe, as only one of your name could do. You\u2019ll take the great part of our force and march on Torrhen\u2019s Square. Helman Tallhart took his best men south, and Benfred died here with their sons. His uncle Leobald will remain, with some small garrison.\u201d If I had been able to question Benfred, I would know just how small. \u201cMake no secret of your approach. Sing all the brave songs you like. I want them to close their gates.\u201d\n\u201cIs this Torrhen\u2019s Square a strong keep?\u201d\n\u201cStrong enough. The walls are stone, thirty feet high, with square towers at each corner and a square keep within.\u201d\n\u201cStone walls cannot be fired. How are we to take them? We do not have the numbers to storm even a small castle.\u201d\n\u201cYou will make camp outside their walls and set to building catapults and siege engines.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the Old Way. Have you forgotten? Ironmen fight with swords and axes, not by flinging rocks. There is no glory in starving out a foeman.\u201d\n\u201cLeobald will not know that. When he sees you raising siege towers, his old woman\u2019s blood will run cold, and he will bleat for help. Stay your archers, Uncle, and let the raven fly. The castellan at Winterfell is a brave man, but age has stiffened his wits as well as his limbs. When he learns that one of his king\u2019s bannermen is under attack by the fearsome Dagmer Cleftjaw, he will summon his strength and ride to Tallhart\u2019s aid. It is his duty. Ser Rodrik is nothing if not dutiful.\u201d\n\u201cAny force he summons will be larger than mine,\u201d Dagmer said, \u201cand these old knights are more cunning than you think, or they would never have lived to see their first grey hair. You set us a battle we cannot hope to win, Theon. This Torrhen\u2019s Square will never fall.\u201d\nTheon smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not Torrhen\u2019s Square I mean to take.\u201d",

      "content": "Arya\nConfusion and clangor ruled the castle. Men stood on the beds of wagons loading casks of wine, sacks of flour, and bundles of new-fletched arrows. Smiths straightened swords, knocked dents from breastplates, and shoed destriers and pack mules alike. Mail shirts were tossed in barrels of sand and rolled across the lumpy surface of the Flowstone Yard to scour them clean. Weese\u2019s women had twenty cloaks to mend, a hundred more to wash. The high and humble crowded into the sept together to pray. Outside the walls, tents and pavilions were coming down. Squires tossed pails of water over cookfires, while soldiers took out their oilstones to give their blades one last good lick. The noise was a swelling tide: horses blowing and whickering, lords shouting commands, men-at-arms trading curses, camp followers squabbling.\nLord Tywin Lannister was marching at last.\nSer Addam Marbrand was the first of the captains to depart, a day before the rest. He made a gallant show of it, riding a spirited red courser whose mane was the same copper color as the long hair that streamed past Ser Addam\u2019s shoulders. The horse was barded in bronze-colored trappings dyed to match the rider\u2019s cloak and emblazoned with the burning tree. Some of the castle women sobbed to see him go. Weese said he was a great horseman and sword fighter, Lord Tywin\u2019s most daring commander.\nI hope he dies, Arya thought as she watched him ride out the gate, his men streaming after him in a double column. I hope they all die. They were going to fight Robb, she knew. Listening to the talk as she went about her work, Arya had learned that Robb had won some great victory in the west. He\u2019d burned Lannisport, some said, or else he meant to burn it. He\u2019d captured Casterly Rock and put everyone to the sword, or he was besieging the Golden Tooth\u2026 but something had happened, that much was certain.\nWeese had her running messages from dawn to dusk. Some of them even took her beyond the castle walls, out into the mud and madness of the camp. I could flee, she thought as a wagon rumbled past her. I could hop on the back of a wagon and hide, or fall in with the camp followers, no one would stop me. She might have done it if not for Weese. He\u2019d told them more than once what he\u2019d do to anyone who tried to run off on him. \u201cIt won\u2019t be no beating, oh, no. I won\u2019t lay a finger on you. I\u2019ll just save you for the Qohorik, yes I will, I\u2019ll save you for the Crippler. Vargo Hoat his name is, and when he gets back he\u2019ll cut off your feet.\u201d Maybe if Weese were dead, Arya thought\u2026 but not when she was with him. He could look at you and smell what you were thinking, he always said so.\nWeese never imagined she could read, though, so he never bothered to seal the messages he gave her. Arya peeked at them all, but they were never anything good, just stupid stuff sending this cart to the granary and that one to the armory. One was a demand for payment on a gambling debt, but the knight she gave it to couldn\u2019t read. When she told him what it said he tried to hit her, but Arya ducked under the blow, snatched a silver-banded drinking horn off his saddle, and darted away. The knight roared and came after her, but she slid between two wayns, wove through a crowd of archers, and jumped a latrine trench. In his mail he couldn\u2019t keep up. When she gave the horn to Weese, he told her that a smart little Weasel like her deserved a reward. \u201cI\u2019ve got my eye on a plump crisp capon to sup on tonight. We\u2019ll share it, me and you. You\u2019ll like that.\u201d\nEverywhere she went, Arya searched for Jaqen H\u2019ghar, wanting to whisper another name to him before those she hated were all gone out of her reach, but amidst the chaos and confusion the Lorathi sellsword was not to be found. He still owed her two deaths, and she was worried she would never get them if he rode off to battle with the rest. Finally she worked up the courage to ask one of the gate guards if he\u2019d gone. \u201cOne of Lorch\u2019s men, is he?\u201d the man said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be going, then. His lordship\u2019s named Ser Amory castellan of Harrenhal. That whole lot\u2019s staying right here, to hold the castle. The Bloody Mummers will be left as well, to do the foraging. That goat Vargo Hoat is like to spit, him and Lorch have always hated each other.\u201d\nThe Mountain would be leaving with Lord Tywin, though. He would command the van in battle, which meant that Dunsen, Polliver, and Raff would all slip between her fingers unless she could find Jaqen and have him kill one of them before they left.\n\u201cWeasel,\u201d Weese said that afternoon. \u201cGet to the armory and tell Lucan that Ser Lyonel notched his sword in practice and needs a new one. Here\u2019s his mark.\u201d He handed her a square of paper. \u201cBe quick about it now, he\u2019s to ride with Ser Kevan Lannister.\u201d\nArya took the paper and ran. The armory adjoined the castle smithy, a long high-roofed tunnel of a building with twenty forges built into its walls and long stone water troughs for tempering the steel. Half of the forges were at work when she entered. The walls rang with the sound of hammers, and burly men in leather aprons stood sweating in the sullen heat as they bent over bellows and anvils. When she spied Gendry, his bare chest was slick with sweat, but the blue eyes under the heavy black hair had the stubborn look she remembered. Arya didn\u2019t know that she even wanted to talk to him. It was his fault they\u2019d all been caught. \u201cWhich one is Lucan?\u201d She thrust out the paper. \u201cI\u2019m to get a new sword for Ser Lyonel.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind about Ser Lyonel.\u201d He drew her aside by the arm. \u201cLast night Hot Pie asked me if I heard you yell Winterfell back at the holdfast, when we were all fighting on the wall.\u201d\n\u201cI never did!\u201d\n\u201cYes you did. I heard you too.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone was yelling stuff,\u201d Arya said defensively. \u201cHot Pie yelled hot pie. He must have yelled it a hundred times.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s what you yelled that matters. I told Hot Pie he should clean the wax out of his ears, that all you yelled was Go to hell! If he asks you, you better say the same.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d she said, even though she thought go to hell was a stupid thing to yell. She didn\u2019t dare tell Hot Pie who she really was. Maybe I should say Hot Pie\u2019s name to Jaqen.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Lucan,\u201d Gendry said.\nLucan grunted at the writing (though Arya did not think he could read it), and pulled down a heavy longsword. \u201cThis is too good for that oaf, and you tell him I said so,\u201d he said as he gave her the blade.\n\u201cI will,\u201d she lied. If she did any such thing, Weese would beat her bloody. Lucan could deliver his own insults.\nThe longsword was a lot heavier than Needle had been, but Arya liked the feel of it. The weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger. Maybe I\u2019m not a water dancer yet, but I\u2019m not a mouse either. A mouse couldn\u2019t use a sword but I can. The gates were open, soldiers coming and going, drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under their loads. She thought about going to the stables and telling them that Ser Lyonel wanted a new horse. She had the paper, the stableboys wouldn\u2019t be able to read it any better than Lucan had. I could take the horse and the sword and just ride out. If the guards tried to stop me I\u2019d show them the paper and say I was bringing everything to Ser Lyonel. She had no notion what Ser Lyonel looked like or where to find him, though. If they questioned her, they\u2019d know, and then Weese\u2026 Weese\u2026\nAs she chewed her lip, trying not to think about how it would feel to have her feet cut off, a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms went past, their bows slung across their shoulders. Arya heard snatches of their talk.\n\u201c\u2026giants I tell you, he\u2019s got giants twenty foot tall come down from beyond the Wall, follow him like dogs\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026not natural, coming on them so fast, in the night and all. He\u2019s more wolf than man, all them Starks are\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026shit on your wolves and giants, the boy\u2019d piss his pants if he knew we was coming. He wasn\u2019t man enough to march on Harrenhal, was he? Ran t\u2019other way, didn\u2019t he? He\u2019d run now if he knew what was best for him.\u201d\n\u201cSo you say, but might be the boy knows something we don\u2019t, maybe it\u2019s us ought to be run\u2026\u201d\nYes, Arya thought. Yes, it\u2019s you who ought to run, you and Lord Tywin and the Mountain and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever he is, all of you better run or my brother will kill you, he\u2019s a Stark, he\u2019s more wolf than man, and so am I.\n\u201cWeasel.\u201d Weese\u2019s voice cracked like a whip. She never saw where he came from, but suddenly he was right in front of her. \u201cGive me that. Took you long enough.\u201d He snatched the sword from her fingers, and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of his hand. \u201cNext time be quicker about it.\u201d\nFor a moment she had been a wolf again, but Weese\u2019s slap took it all away and left her with nothing but the taste of her own blood in her mouth. She\u2019d bitten her tongue when he hit her. She hated him for that.\n\u201cYou want another?\u201d Weese demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it too. I\u2019ll have none of your insolent looks. Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him, but he better send his lads to fetch them or I\u2019ll find someone wants \u2019em worse.\u201d Arya started off, but not quick enough for Weese. \u201cYou run if you want to eat tonight,\u201d he shouted, his promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be getting lost again, or I swear I\u2019ll beat you bloody.\u201d\nYou won\u2019t, Arya thought. You won\u2019t ever again. But she ran. The old gods of the north must have been guiding her steps. Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow\u2019s Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling laughter. Rorge came around a corner with three other men, the manticore badge of Ser Amory sewn over their hearts. When he saw her, he stopped and grinned, showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face. \u201cYoren\u2019s little cunt,\u201d he called her. \u201cGuess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall, don\u2019t we?\u201d He laughed again, and the others laughed with him. \u201cWhere\u2019s your stick now?\u201d Rorge demanded suddenly, the smile gone as quick as it had come. \u201cSeems to me I promised to fuck you with it.\u201d He took a step toward her. Arya edged backward. \u201cNot so brave now that I\u2019m not in chains, are you?\u201d\n\u201cI saved you.\u201d She kept a good yard between them, ready to run quick as a snake if he made a grab for her.\n\u201cOwe you another fucking for that, seems like. Did Yoren pump your cunny, or did he like that tight little ass better?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Jaqen,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a message.\u201d\nRorge halted. Something in his eyes\u2026 could it be that he was scared of Jaqen H\u2019ghar? \u201cThe bathhouse. Get out of my way.\u201d\nArya whirled and ran, swift as a deer, her feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the bathhouse, She found Jaqen soaking in a tub, steam rising around him as a serving girl sluiced hot water over his head. His long hair, red on one side and white on the other, fell down across his shoulders, wet and heavy.\nShe crept up quiet as a shadow, but he opened his eyes all the same. \u201cShe steals in on little mice feet, but a man hears,\u201d he said. How could he hear me? she wondered, and it seemed as if he heard that as well. \u201cThe scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a man with open ears. Clever girls go barefoot.\u201d\n\u201cI have a message.\u201d Arya eyed the serving girl uncertainly. When she did not seem likely to go away, she leaned in until her mouth was almost touching his ear. \u201cWeese,\u201d she whispered.\nJaqen H\u2019ghar closed his eyes again, floating languid, half-asleep. \u201cTell his lordship a man shall attend him at his leisure.\u201d His hand moved suddenly, splashing hot water at her, and Arya had to leap back to keep from getting drenched.\nWhen she told Tuffleberry what Weese had said, the brewer cursed loudly. \u201cYou tell Weese my lads got duties to attend to, and you tell him he\u2019s a pox-ridden bastard too, and the seven hells will freeze over before he gets another horn of my ale. I\u2019ll have them barrels within the hour or Lord Tywin will hear of it, see if he don\u2019t.\u201d\nWeese cursed too when Arya brought back that message, even though she left out the pox-ridden bastard part. He fumed and threatened, but in the end he rounded up six men and sent them off grumbling to fetch the barrels down to the brewhouse.\nSupper that evening was a thin stew of barley, onion, and carrots, with a wedge of stale brown bread. One of the women had taken to sleeping in Weese\u2019s bed, and she got a piece of ripe blue cheese as well, and a wing off the capon that Weese had spoken of that morning. He ate the rest himself, the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at the corner of his mouth. The bird was almost gone when he glanced up from his trencher and saw Arya staring. \u201cWeasel, come here.\u201d\nA few mouthfuls of dark meat still clung to one thigh. He forgot, but now he\u2019s remembered, Arya thought. It made her feel bad for telling Jaqen to kill him. She got off the bench and went to the head of the table.\n\u201cI saw you looking at me.\u201d Weese wiped his fingers on the front of her shift. Then he grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d He slapped her again, backhand. \u201cKeep those eyes to yourself, or next time I\u2019ll spoon one out and feed it to my bitch.\u201d A shove sent her stumbling to the floor. Her hem caught on a loose nail in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as she fell. \u201cYou\u2019ll mend that before you sleep,\u201d Weese announced as he pulled the last bit of meat off the capon. When he was finished he sucked his fingers noisily, and threw the bones to his ugly spotted dog.\n\u201cWeese,\u201d Arya whispered that night as she bent over the tear in her shift. \u201cDunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling,\u201d she said, calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle through the undyed wool. \u201cThe Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\u201d She wondered how much longer she would have to include Weese in her prayer, and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow, when she woke, he\u2019d be dead.\nBut it was the sharp toe of Weese\u2019s boot that woke her, as ever. The main strength of Lord Tywin\u2019s host would ride this day, he told them as they broke their fast on oatcakes. \u201cDon\u2019t none of you be thinking how easy it\u2019ll be here once m\u2019lord of Lannister is gone,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe castle won\u2019t grow no smaller, I promise you that, only now there\u2019ll be fewer hands to tend to it. You lot of slugabeds are going to learn what work is now, yes you are.\u201d\nNot from you. Arya picked at her oaten cake. Weese frowned at her, as if he smelled her secret. Quickly she dropped her gaze to her food, and dared not raise her eyes again.\nPale light filled the yard when Lord Tywin Lannister took his leave of Harrenhal. Arya watched from an arched window halfway up the Wailing Tower. His charger wore a blanket of enameled crimson scales and gilded crinet and chamfron, while Lord Tywin himself sported a thick ermine cloak. His brother Ser Kevan looked near as splendid. No less than four standard-bearers went before them, carrying huge crimson banners emblazoned with the golden lion. Behind the Lannisters came their great lords and captains. Their banners flared and flapped, a pageant of color: red ox and golden mountain, purple unicorn and bantam rooster, brindled boar and badger, a silver ferret and a juggler in motley, stars and sunbursts, peacock and panther, chevron and dagger, black hood and blue beetle and green arrow.\nLast of all came Ser Gregor Clegane in his grey plate steel, astride a stallion as bad-tempered as his rider. Polliver rode beside him, with the black dog standard in his hand and Gendry\u2019s horned helm on his head. He was a tall man, but he looked no more than a half-grown boy when he rode in his master\u2019s shadow.\nA shiver crept up Arya\u2019s spine as she watched them pass under the great iron portcullis of Harrenhal. Suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake. I\u2019m so stupid, she thought. Weese did not matter, no more than Chiswyck had. These were the men who mattered, the ones she ought to have killed. Last night she could have whispered any of them dead, if only she hadn\u2019t been so mad at Weese for hitting her and lying about the capon. Lord Tywin, why didn\u2019t I say Lord Tywin?\nPerhaps it was not too late to change her mind. Weese was not killed yet. If she could find Jaqen, tell him\u2026\nHurriedly, Arya ran down the twisting steps, her chores forgotten. She heard the rattle of chains as the portcullis was slowly lowered, its spikes sinking deep into the ground\u2026 and then another sound, a shriek of pain and fear.\nA dozen people got there before her, though none was coming any too close. Arya squirmed between them. Weese was sprawled across the cobbles, his throat a red ruin, eyes gaping sightlessly up at a bank of grey cloud. His ugly spotted dog stood on his chest, lapping at the blood pulsing from his neck, and every so often ripping a mouthful of flesh out of the dead man\u2019s face.\nFinally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while she was worrying at one of Weese\u2019s ears.\n\u201cDamnedest thing,\u201d she heard a man say. \u201cHe had that bitch dog since she was a pup.\u201d\n\u201cThis place is cursed,\u201d the man with the crossbow said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Harren\u2019s ghost, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d said Goodwife Amabel. \u201cI\u2019ll not sleep here another night, I swear it.\u201d\nArya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog. Jaqen H\u2019ghar was leaning up against the side of the Wailing Tower. When he saw her looking, he lifted a hand to his face and laid two fingers casually against his cheek.",

      "content": "Catelyn\nTwo days ride from Riverrun, a scout spied them watering their horses beside a muddy steam. Catelyn had never been so glad to see the twin tower badge of House Frey.\nWhen she asked him to lead them to her uncle, he said, \u201cThe Blackfish is gone west with the king, my lady. Martyn Rivers commands the outriders in his stead.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d She had met Rivers at the Twins; a baseborn son of Lord Walder Frey, half brother to Ser Perwyn. It did not surprise her to learn that Robb had struck at the heart of Lannister power; clearly he had been contemplating just that when he sent her away to treat with Renly. \u201cWhere is Rivers now?\u201d\n\u201cHis camp is two hours ride, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cTake us to him,\u201d she commanded. Brienne helped her back into her saddle, and they set out at once.\n\u201cHave you come from Bitterbridge, my lady?\u201d the scout asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She had not dared. With Renly dead, Catelyn had been uncertain of the reception she might receive from his young widow and her protectors. Instead she had ridden through the heart of the war, through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the Lannisters, and each night her scouts brought back tales that made her ill. \u201cLord Renly is slain,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe\u2019d hoped that tale was some Lannister lie, or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWould that it were. My brother commands in Riverrun?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lady. His Grace left Ser Edmure to hold Riverrun and guard his rear.\u201d\nGods grant him the strength to do so, Catelyn thought. And the wisdom as well. \u201cIs there word from Robb in the west?\u201d\n\u201cYou have not heard?\u201d The man seemed surprised. \u201cHis Grace won a great victory at Oxcross. Ser Stafford Lannister is dead, his host scattered.\u201d\nSer Wendel Manderly gave a whoop of pleasure, but Catelyn only nodded. Tomorrow\u2019s trials concerned her more than yesterday\u2019s triumphs.\nMartyn Rivers had made his camp in the shell of a shattered holdfast, beside a roofless stable and a hundred fresh graves. He went to one knee when Catelyn dismounted. \u201cWell met, my lady. Your brother charged us to keep an eye out for your party, and escort you back to Riverrun in all haste should we come upon you.\u201d\nCatelyn scarce liked the sound of that. \u201cIs it my father?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lady. Lord Hoster is unchanged.\u201d Rivers was a ruddy man with scant resemblance to his half brothers. \u201cIt is only that we feared you might chance upon Lannister scouts. Lord Tywin has left Harrenhal and marches west with all his power.\u201d\n\u201cRise,\u201d she told Rivers, frowning. Stannis Baratheon would soon be on the march as well, gods help them all. \u201cHow long until Lord Tywin is upon us?\u201d\n\u201cThree days, perhaps four, it is hard to know. We have eyes out along all the roads, but it would be best not to linger.\u201d\nNor did they. Rivers broke his camp quickly and saddled up beside her, and they set off again, near fifty strong now, flying beneath the direwolf, the leaping trout, the twin towers.\nHer men wanted to hear more of Robb\u2019s victory at Oxcross, and Rivers obliged. \u201cThere\u2019s a singer come to Riverrun, calls himself Rymund the Rhymer, he\u2019s made a song of the fight. Doubtless you\u2019ll hear it sung tonight, my lady. \u2018Wolf in the Night\u2019 this Rymund calls it.\u201d He went on to tell how the remnants of Ser Stafford\u2019s host had fallen back on Lannisport. Without siege engines there was no way to storm Casterly Rock, so the Young Wolf was paying the Lannisters back in kind for the devastation they\u2019d inflicted on the riverlands. Lords Karstark and Glover were raiding along the coast, Lady Mormont had captured thousands of cattle and was driving them back toward Riverrun, while the Greatjon had seized the gold mines at Castamere, Nunn\u2019s Deep, and the Pendric Hills. Ser Wendel laughed. \u201cNothing\u2019s more like to bring a Lannister running than a threat to his gold.\u201d\n\u201cHow did the king ever take the Tooth?\u201d Ser Perwyn Frey asked his bastard brother. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard strong keep, and it commands the hill road.\u201d\n\u201cHe never took it. He slipped around it in the night. It\u2019s said the direwolf showed him the way, that Grey Wind of his. The beast sniffed out a goat track that wound down a defile and up along beneath a ridge, a crooked and stony way, yet wide enough for men riding single file. The Lannisters in their watchtowers got not so much a glimpse of them.\u201d Rivers lowered his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s some say that after the battle, the king cut out Stafford Lannister\u2019s heart and fed it to the wolf.\u201d\n\u201cI would not believe such tales,\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cMy son is no savage.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my lady. Still, it\u2019s no more than the beast deserved. That is no common wolf, that one. The Greatjon\u2019s been heard to say that the old gods of the north sent those direwolves to your children.\u201d\nCatelyn remembered the day when her boys had found the pups in the late summer snows. There had been five, three male and two female for the five trueborn children of House Stark\u2026 and a sixth, white of fur and red of eye, for Ned\u2019s bastard son Jon Snow. No common wolves, she thought. No indeed.\nThat night as they made their camp, Brienne sought out her tent. \u201cMy lady, you are safely back among your own now, a day\u2019s ride from your brother\u2019s castle. Give me leave to go.\u201d\nCatelyn should not have been surprised. The homely young woman had kept to herself all through their journey, spending most of her time with the horses, brushing out their coats and pulling stones from their shoes. She had helped Shadd cook and clean game as well, and soon proved that she could hunt as well as any. Any task Catelyn asked her to turn her hand to, Brienne had performed deftly and without complaint, and when she was spoken to she answered politely, but she never chattered, nor wept, nor laughed. She had ridden with them every day and slept among them every night without ever truly becoming one of them.\nIt was the same when she was with Renly, Catelyn thought. At the feast, in the melee, even in Renly\u2019s pavilion with her brothers of the Rainbow Guard. There are walls around this one higher than Winterfell\u2019s.\n\u201cIf you left us, where would you go?\u201d Catelyn asked her.\n\u201cBack,\u201d Brienne said. \u201cTo Storm\u2019s End.\u201d\n\u201cAlone.\u201d It was not a question.\nThe broad face was a pool of still water, giving no hint of what might live in the depths below. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to kill Stannis.\u201d\nBrienne closed her thick callused fingers around the hilt of her sword.\nThe sword that had been his. \u201cI swore a vow. Three times I swore. You heard me.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Catelyn admitted. The girl had kept the rainbow cloak when she discarded the rest of her bloodstained clothing, she knew. Brienne\u2019s own things had been left behind during their flight, and she had been forced to clothe herself in odd bits of Ser Wendel\u2019s spare garb, since no one else in their party had garments large enough to fit her. \u201cVows should be kept, I agree, but Stannis has a great host around him, and his own guards sworn to keep him safe.\u201d\n\u201cI am not afraid of his guards. I am as good as any of them. I should never have fled.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what troubles you, that some fool might call you craven?\u201d She sighed. \u201cRenly\u2019s death was no fault of youts. You served him valiantly, but when you seek to follow him into the earth, you serve no one.\u201d She stretched out a hand, to give what comfort a touch could give. \u201cI know how hard it is\u2014\u201d\nBrienne shook off her hand. \u201cNo one knows.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cEvery morning, when I wake, I remember that Ned is gone. I have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to King\u2019s Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister\u2019s white throat and squeezing until her face turns black.\u201d\nThe Beauty raised her eyes, the only part of her that was truly beautiful. \u201cIf you dream that, why would you seek to hold me back? Is it because of what Stannis said at the parley?\u201d\nWas it? Catelyn glanced across the camp. Two men were walking sentry, spears in hand. \u201cI was taught that good men must fight evil in this world, and Renly\u2019s death was evil beyond all doubt. Yet I was also taught that the gods make kings, not the swords of men. If Stannis is our rightful king\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not. Robert was never the rightful king either, even Renly said as much. Jaime Lannister murdered the rightful king, after Robert killed his lawful heir on the Trident. Where were the gods then? The gods don\u2019t care about men, no more than kings care about peasants.\u201d\n\u201cA good king does care.\u201d\n\u201cLord Renly\u2026 His Grace, he\u2026 he would have been the best king, my lady, he was so good, he\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe is gone, Brienne,\u201d she said, as gently as she could. \u201cStannis and Joffrey remain\u2026 and so does my son.\u201d\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t\u2026 you\u2019d never make a peace with Stannis, would you? Bend the knee? You wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you true, Brienne. I do not know. My son may be a king, but I am no queen\u2026 only a mother who would keep her children safe, however she could.\u201d\n\u201cI am not made to be a mother. I need to fight.\u201d\n\u201cThen fight\u2026 but for the living, not the dead. Renly\u2019s enemies are Robb\u2019s enemies as well.\u201d\nBrienne stared at the ground and shuffled her feet. \u201cI do not know your son, my lady.\u201d She looked up. \u201cI could serve you. If you would have me.\u201d\nCatelyn was startled. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\nThe question seemed to trouble Brienne. \u201cYou helped me. In the pavilion\u2026 when they thought that I had\u2026 that I had\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were innocent.\u201d\n\u201cEven so, you did not have to do that. You could have let them kill me. I was nothing to you.\u201d\nPerhaps I did not want to be the only one who knew the dark truth of what had happened there, Catelyn thought. \u201cBrienne, I have taken many wellborn ladies into my service over the years, but never one like you. I am no battle commander.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but you have courage. Not battle courage perhaps but\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 a kind of woman\u2019s courage. And I think, when the time comes, you will not try and hold me back. Promise me that. That you will not hold me back from Stannis.\u201d\nCatelyn could still hear Stannis saying that Robb\u2019s turn too would come in time. It was like a cold breath on the back of her neck. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will not hold you back.\u201d\nThe tall girl knelt awkwardly, unsheathed Renly\u2019s longsword, and laid it at her feet. \u201cThen I am yours, my lady. Your liege man, or\u2026 whatever you would have me be. I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours, if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and meat and mead at my table, and pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you into dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.\u201d As she clasped the other woman\u2019s hands between her own, Catelyn could not help but smile. How many times did I watch Ned accept a man\u2019s oath of service? She wondered what he would think if he could see her now.\nThey forded the Red Fork late the next day, upstream of Riverrun where the river made a wide loop and the waters grew muddy and shallow. The crossing was guarded by a mixed force of archers and pikemen wearing the eagle badge of the Mallisters. When they saw Catelyn\u2019s banners, they emerged from behind their sharpened stakes and sent a man over from the far bank to lead her party across. \u201cSlow and careful like, milady,\u201d he warned as he took the bridle of her horse. \u201cWe\u2019ve planted iron spikes under the water, y\u2019see, and there\u2019s caltrops scattered among them rocks there. It\u2019s the same on all the fords, by your brother\u2019s command.\u201d\nEdmure thinks to fight here. The realization gave her a queasy feeling in the bowels, but she held her tongue.\nBetween the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, they joined a stream of smallfolk making for the safety of Riverrun. Some were driving animals before them, others pulling wayns, but they made way as Catelyn rode past, and cheered her with cries of \u201cTully!\u201d or \u201cStark!\u201d Half a mile from the castle, she passed through a large encampment where the scarlet banner of the Blackwoods waved above the lord\u2019s tent. Lucas took his leave of her there, to seek out his father, Lord Tytos. The rest rode on.\nCatelyn spied a second camp strung out along the bank north of the Tumblestone, familiar standards flapping in the wind\u2014Marq Piper\u2019s dancing maiden, Darry\u2019s plowman, the twining red-and-white snakes of the Paeges. They were all her father\u2019s bannermen, lords of the Trident. Most had left Riverrun before she had, to defend their own lands. If they were here again, it could only mean that Edmure had called them back. Gods save us, it\u2019s true, he means to offer battle to Lord Tywin.\nSomething dark was dangling against the walls of Riverrun, Catelyn saw from a distance. When she rode close, she saw dead men hanging from the battlements, slumped at the ends of long ropes with hempen nooses tight around their necks, their faces swollen and black. The crows had been at them, but their crimson cloaks still showed bright against the sandstone walls.\n\u201cThey have hanged some Lannisters,\u201d Hal Mollen observed.\n\u201cA pretty sight,\u201d Ser Wendel Manderly said cheerfully.\n\u201cOur friends have begun without us,\u201d Perwyn Frey jested. The others laughed, all but Brienne, who gazed up at the row of bodies unblinking, and neither spoke nor smiled.\nIf they have slain the Kingslayer, then my daughters are dead as well. Catelyn spurred her horse to a canter. Hal Mollen and Robin Flint raced past at a gallop, halooing to the gatehouse. The guards on the walls had doubtless spied her banners some time ago, for the portcullis was up as they approached.\nEdmure rode out from the castle to meet her, surrounded by three of her father\u2019s sworn men\u2014great-bellied Ser Desmond Grell the master-at-arms, Utherydes Wayn the steward, and Ser Robin Ryger, Riverrun\u2019s big bald captain of guards. They were all three of an age with Lord Hoster, men who had spent their lives in her father\u2019s service. Old men, Catelyn realized.\nEdmure wore a blue-and-red cloak over a tunic embroidered with silver fish. From the look of him, he had not shaved since she rode south; his beard was a fiery bush. \u201cCat, it is good to have you safely back. When we heard of Renly\u2019s death, we feared for your life. And Lord Tywin is on the march as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo I am told. How fares our father?\u201d\n\u201cOne day he seems stronger, the next\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s asked for you. I did not know what to tell him.\u201d\n\u201cI will go to him soon,\u201d she vowed. \u201cHas there been word from Storm\u2019s End since Renly died? Or from Bitterbridge?\u201d No ravens came to men on the road, and Catelyn was anxious to know what had happened behind her.\n\u201cNothing from Bitterbridge. From Storm\u2019s End, three birds from the castellan, Ser Cortnay Penrose, all carrying the same plea. Stannis has him surrounded by land and sea. He offers his allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege. He fears for the boy, he says. What boy would that be, do you know?\u201d\n\u201cEdric Storm,\u201d Brienne told them. \u201cRobert\u2019s bastard son.\u201d\nEdmure looked at her curiously. \u201cStannis has sworn that the garrison might go free, unharmed, provided they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his hands, but Ser Cortnay will not consent.\u201d\nHe risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even his own, Catelyn thought. \u201cDid you send him an answer?\u201d\nEdmure shook his head. \u201cWhy, when we have neither help nor hope to offer? And Stannis is no enemy of ours.\u201d\nSer Robin Ryger spoke. \u201cMy lady, can you tell us the manner of Lord Renly\u2019s death? The tales we\u2019ve heard have been queer.\u201d\n\u201cCat,\u201d her brother said, \u201csome say you killed Renly. Others claim it was some southron woman.\u201d His glance lingered on Brienne.\n\u201cMy king was murdered,\u201d the girl said quietly, \u201cand not by Lady Catelyn. I swear it on my sword, by the gods old and new.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Brienne of Tarth, the daughter of Lord Selwyn the Evenstar, who served in Renly\u2019s Rainbow Guard,\u201d Catelyn told them. \u201cBrienne, I am honored to acquaint you with my brother Ser Edmure Tully, heir to Riverrun. His steward Utherydes Wayn. Ser Robin Ryger and Ser Desmond Grell.\u201d\n\u201cHonored,\u201d said Ser Desmond. The others echoed him. The girl flushed, embarrassed even at this commonplace courtesy. If Edmure thought her a curious sort of lady, at least he had the grace not to say so.\n\u201cBrienne was with Renly when he was killed, as was I,\u201d said Catelyn, \u201cbut we had no part in his death.\u201d She did not care to speak of the shadow, here in the open with men all around, so she waved a hand at the bodies. \u201cWho are these men you\u2019ve hanged?\u201d\nEdmure glanced up uncomfortably. \u201cThey came with Ser Cleos when he brought the queen\u2019s answer to our peace offer.\u201d\nCatelyn was shocked. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed envoys?\u201d\n\u201cFalse envoys,\u201d Edmure declared. \u201cThey pledged me their peace and surrendered their weapons, so I allowed them freedom of the castle, and for three nights they ate my meat and drank my mead whilst I talked with Ser Cleos. On the fourth night, they tried to free the Kingslayer.\u201d He pointed up. \u201cThat big brute killed two guards with naught but those ham hands of his, caught them by the throats and smashed their skulls together while that skinny lad beside him was opening Lannister\u2019s cell with a bit of wire, gods curse him. The one on the end was some sort of damned mummer. He used my own voice to command that the River Gate be opened. The guardsmen swear to it, Enger and Delp and Long Lew, all three. If you ask me, the man sounded nothing like me, and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the same.\u201d\nThis was the Imp\u2019s work, Catelyn suspected; it stank of the same sort of cunning he had displayed at the Eyrie. Once, she would have named Tyrion the least dangerous of the Lannisters. Now she was not so certain. \u201cHow is it you caught them?\u201d\n\u201cAh, as it happened, I was not in the castle. I\u2019d crossed the Tumblestone to, ah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were whoring or wenching. Get on with the tale.\u201d\nEdmure\u2019s cheeks flamed as red as his beard. \u201cIt was the hour before dawn, and I was only then returning. When Long Lew saw my boat and recognized me, he finally thought to wonder who was standing below barking commands, and raised a cry.\u201d\n\u201cTell me the Kingslayer was retaken.\u201d\n\u201cYes, though not easily. Jaime got hold of a sword, slew Poul Pernford and Ser Desmond\u2019s squire Myles, and wounded Delp so badly that Maester Vyman fears he\u2019ll soon die as well. It was a bloody mess. At the sound of steel, some of the other red cloaks rushed to join him, barehand or no. I hanged those beside the four who freed him, and threw the rest in the dungeons. Jaime too. We\u2019ll have no more escapes from that one. He\u2019s down in the dark this time, chained hand and foot and bolted to the wall.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Cleos Frey?\u201d\n\u201cHe swears he knew naught of the plot. Who can say? The man is half Lannister, half Frey, and all liar. I put him in Jaime\u2019s old tower cell.\u201d\n\u201cYou say he brought terms?\u201d\n\u201cIf you can call them that. You\u2019ll like them no more than I did, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cCan we hope for no help from the south, Lady Stark?\u201d asked Utherydes Wayn, her father\u2019s steward. \u201cThis charge of incest\u2026 Lord Tywin does not suffer such slights lightly. He will seek to wash the stain from his daughter\u2019s name with the blood of her accuser, Lord Stannis must see that. He has no choice but to make common cause with us.\u201d\nStannis has made common cause with a power greater and darker. \u201cLet us speak of these matters later.\u201d Catelyn trotted over the drawbridge, putting the grisly row of dead Lannisters behind her. Her brother kept pace. As they rode out into the bustle of Riverrun\u2019s upper bailey, a naked toddler ran in front of the horses. Catelyn jerked her reins hard to avoid him, glancing about in dismay. Hundreds of smallfolk had been admitted to the castle, and allowed to erect crude shelters against the walls. Their children were everywhere underfoot, and the yard teemed with their cows, sheep, and chickens. \u201cWho are all these folk?\u201d\n\u201cMy people,\u201d Edmure answered. \u201cThey were afraid.\u201d\nOnly my sweet brother would crowd all these useless mouths into a castle that might soon be under siege. Catelyn knew that Edmure had a soft heart; sometimes she thought his head was even softer. She loved him for it, yet still\u2026\n\u201cCan Robb be reached by raven?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the field, my lady,\u201d Ser Desmond replied. \u201cThe bird would have no way to find him.\u201d\nUtherydes Wayn coughed. \u201cBefore he left us, the young king instructed us to send you on to the Twins upon your return, Lady Stark. He asks that you learn more of Lord Walder\u2019s daughters, to help him select his bride when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll provide you with fresh mounts and provisions,\u201d her brother promised. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to refresh yourself before\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll want to stay,\u201d Catelyn said, dismounting. She had no intention of leaving Riverrun and her dying father to pick Robb\u2019s wife for him. Robb wants me safe, I cannot fault him for that, but his pretext is growing threadbare. \u201cBoy,\u201d she called, and an urchin from the stables ran out to take the reins of her horse.\nEdmure swung down from his saddle. He was a head taller than she was, but he would always be her little brother. \u201cCat,\u201d he said unhappily, \u201cLord Tywin is coming\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe is making for the west, to defend his own lands. If we close our gates and shelter behind the walls, we can watch him pass with safety.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Tully land,\u201d Edmure declared. \u201cIf Tywin Lannister thinks to cross it unbloodied, I mean to teach him a hard lesson.\u201d\nThe same lesson you taught his son? Her brother could be stubborn as river rock when his pride was touched, but neither of them was likely to forget how Ser Jaime had cut Edmure\u2019s host to bloody pieces the last time he had offered battle. \u201cWe have nothing to gain and everything to lose by meeting Lord Tywin in the field,\u201d Catelyn said tactfully.\n\u201cThe yard is not the place to discuss my battle plans.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will. Where shall we go?\u201d\nHer brother\u2019s face darkened. For a moment she thought he was about to lose his temper with her, but finally he snapped, \u201cThe godswood. If you will insist.\u201d\nShe followed him along a gallery to the godswood gate. Edmure\u2019s anger had always been a sulky, sullen thing. Catelyn was sorry she had wounded him, but the matter was too important for her to concern herself with his pride. When they were alone beneath the trees, Edmure turned to face her.\n\u201cYou do not have the strength to meet the Lannisters in the field,\u201d she said bluntly.\n\u201cWhen all my strength is marshaled, I should have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse,\u201d Edmure said.\n\u201cWhich means Lord Tywin will have near twice your numbers.\u201d\n\u201cRobb\u2019s won his battles against worse odds,\u201d Edmure replied, \u201cand I have a plan. You\u2019ve forgotten Roose Bolton. Lord Tywin defeated him on the Green Fork, but failed to pursue. When Lord Tywin went to Harrenhal, Bolton took the ruby ford and the crossroads. He has ten thousand men. I\u2019ve sent word to Helman Tallhart to join him with the garrison Robb left at the Twins\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEdmure, Robb left those men to hold the Twins and make certain Lord Walder keeps faith with us.\u201d\n\u201cHe has,\u201d Edmure said stubbornly. \u201cThe Freys fought bravely in the Whispering Wood, and old Ser Stevron died at Oxcross, we hear. Ser Ryman and Black Walder and the rest are with Robb in the west, Martyn has been of great service scouting, and Ser Perwyn helped see you safe to Renly. Gods be good, how much more can we ask of them? Robb\u2019s betrothed to one of Lord Walder\u2019s daughters, and Roose Bolton wed another, I hear. And haven\u2019t you taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at Winterfell?\u201d\n\u201cA ward can easily become a hostage, if need be.\u201d She had not known that Ser Stevron was dead, nor of Bolton\u2019s marriage.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re two hostages to the good, all the more reason Lord Walder dare not play us false. Bolton needs Frey\u2019s men, and Ser Helman\u2019s as well. I\u2019ve commanded him to retake Harrenhal.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s like to be a bloody business.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but once the castle falls, Lord Tywin will have no safe retreat. My own levies will defend the fords of Red Fork against his crossing. If he attacks across the river, he\u2019ll end as Rhaegar did when he tried to cross the Trident. If he holds back, he\u2019ll be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal, and when Robb returns from the west we can finish him for good and all.\u201d\nHer brother\u2019s voice was full of brusque confidence, but Catelyn found herself wishing that Robb had not taken her uncle Brynden west with him. The Blackfish was the veteran of half a hundred battles; Edmure was the veteran of one, and that one lost.\n\u201cThe plan\u2019s a good one,\u201d he concluded. \u201cLord Tytos says so, and Lord Jonos as well. When did Blackwood and Bracken agree about anything that was not certain, I ask you?\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may.\u201d She was suddenly weary. Perhaps she was wrong to oppose him. Perhaps it was a splendid plan, and her misgivings only a woman\u2019s fears. She wished Ned were here, or her uncle Brynden, or\u2026\u201cHave you asked Father about this?\u201d\n\u201cFather is in no state to weigh strategies. Two days ago he was making plans for your marriage to Brandon Stark! Go see him yourself if you do not believe me. This plan will work, Cat, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so, Edmure. I truly do.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek, to let him know she meant it, and went to find her father.\nLord Hoster Tully was much as she had left him\u2014abed, haggard, flesh pale and clammy. The room smelled of sickness, a cloying odor made up in equal parts of stale sweat and medicine. When she pulled back the drapes, her father gave a low moan, and his eyes fluttered open. He stared at her as if he could not comprehend who she was or what she wanted.\n\u201cFather.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cI am returned.\u201d\nHe seemed to know her then. \u201cYou\u2019ve come,\u201d he whispered faintly, lips barely moving.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cRobb sent me south, but I hurried back.\u201d\n\u201cSouth\u2026 where\u2026 is the Eyrie south, sweetling? I don\u2019t recall\u2026 oh, dear heart, I was afraid\u2026 have you forgiven me, child?\u201d Tears ran down his cheeks.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing that needs forgiveness, Father.\u201d She stroked his limp white hair and felt his brow. The fever still burned him from within, despite all the maester\u2019s potions.\n\u201cIt was best,\u201d her father whispered. \u201cJon\u2019s a good man, good\u2026 strong, kind\u2026 take care of you\u2026 he will\u2026 and well born, listen to me, you must, I\u2019m your father\u2026 your father\u2026 you\u2019ll wed when Cat does, yes you will\u2026\u201d\nHe thinks I\u2019m Lysa, Catelyn realized. Gods be good, he talks as if we were not married yet.\nHer father\u2019s hands clutched at hers, fluttering like two frightened white birds. \u201cThat stripling\u2026 wretched boy\u2026 not speak that name to me, your duty\u2026 your mother, she would\u2026\u201d Lord Hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over him. \u201cOh, gods forgive me, forgive me, forgive me. My medicine\u2026\u201d\nAnd then Maester Vyman was there, holding a cup to his lips. Lord Hoster sucked at the thick white potion as eager as a babe at the breast, and Catelyn could see peace settle over him once more. \u201cHe\u2019ll sleep now, my lady,\u201d the maester said when the cup was empty. The milk of the poppy had left a thick white film around her father\u2019s mouth. Maester Vyman wiped it away with a sleeve.\nCatelyn could watch no more. Hoster Tully had been a strong man, and proud. It hurt her to see him reduced to this. She went out to the terrace. The yard below was crowded with refugees and chaotic with their noises, but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure and endless. Those are his rivers, and soon he will return to them for his last voyage.\nMaester Vyman had followed her out. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI cannot keep the end at bay much longer. We ought send a rider after his brother. Ser Brynden would wish to be here.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Catelyn said, her voice thick with her grief.\n\u201cAnd the Lady Lysa as well, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cLysa will not come.\u201d\n\u201cIf you wrote her yourself, perhaps\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI will put some words to paper, if that please you.\u201d She wondered who Lysa\u2019s \u201cwretched stripling\u201d had been. Some young squire or hedge knight, like as not\u2026 though by the vehemence with which Lord Hoster had opposed him, he might have been a tradesman\u2019s son or baseborn apprentice, even a singer. Lysa had always been too fond of singers. I must not blame her. Jon Arryn was twenty years older than our father, however noble.\nThe tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that she and Lysa had shared as maids. It would feel good to sleep on a featherbed again, with a warm fire in the hearth; when she was rested the world would seem less bleak.\nBut outside her chambers she found Utherydes Wayn waiting with two women clad in grey, their faces cowled save for their eyes. Catelyn knew at once why they were here. \u201cNed?\u201d\nThe sisters lowered their gaze. Utherydes said, \u201cSer Cleos brought him from King\u2019s Landing, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cTake me to him,\u201d she commanded.\nThey had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner, the white banner of House Stark with its grey direwolf sigil. \u201cI would look on him,\u201d Catelyn said.\n\u201cOnly the bones remain, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cI would look on him,\u201d she repeated.\nOne of the silent sisters turned down the banner.\nBones, Catelyn thought. This is not Ned, this is not the man I loved, the father of my children. His hands were clasped together over his chest, skeletal fingers curled about the hilt of some longsword, but they were not Ned\u2019s hands, so strong and full of life. They had dressed the bones in Ned\u2019s surcoat, the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the heart, but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights, the arms that had held her. The head had been rejoined to the body with fine silver wire, but one skull looks much like another, and in those empty hollows she found no trace of her lord\u2019s dark grey eyes, eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone. They gave his eyes to crows, she remembered.\nCatelyn turned away. \u201cThat is not his sword.\u201d\n\u201cIce was not returned to us, my lady,\u201d Utherydes said. \u201cOnly Lord Eddard\u2019s bones.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I must thank the queen for even that much.\u201d\n\u201cThank the Imp, my lady. It was his doing.\u201d\nOne day I will thank them all. \u201cI am grateful for your service, sisters,\u201d Catelyn said, \u201cbut I must lay another task upon you. Lord Eddard was a Stark, and his bones must be laid to rest beneath Winterfell.\u201d They will make a statue of him, a stone likeness that will sit in the dark with a direwolf at his feet and a sword across his knees. \u201cMake certain the sisters have fresh horses, and aught else they need for the journey,\u201d she told Utherydes Wayn. \u201cHal Mollen will escort them back to Winterfell, it is his place as captain of guards.\u201d She gazed down at the bones that were all that remained of her lord and love. \u201cNow leave me, all of you. I would be alone with Ned tonight.\u201d\nThe women in grey bowed their heads. The silent sisters do not speak to the living, Catelyn remembered dully, but some say they can talk to the dead. And how she envied that\u2026",

      "content": "Daenerys\nThe drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets, but they could not keep out disappointment. Dany climbed inside wearily, glad for the refuge from the sea of Qartheen eyes. \u201cMake way,\u201d Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback, snapping his whip, \u201cmake way, make way for the Mother of Dragons.\u201d\nReclining on cool satin cushions, Xaro Xhoan Daxos poured ruby-red wine into matched goblets of jade and gold, his hands sure and steady despite the sway of the palanquin. \u201cI see a deep sadness written upon your face, my light of love.\u201d He offered her a goblet. \u201cCould it be the sadness of a lost dream?\u201d\n\u201cA dream delayed, no more.\u201d Dany\u2019s tight silver collar was chafing against her throat. She unfastened it and flung it aside. The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro swore would ward her against all poisons. The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous, but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water. They never saw me for a queen, she thought bitterly. I was only an afternoon\u2019s amusement, a horse girl with a curious pet.\nRhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a hand for the wine. Wincing, she shifted him to her other shoulder, where he could claw her gown instead of her skin. She was garbed after the Qartheen fashion. Xaro had warned her that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki, so she had taken care to go before them in flowing green samite with one breast bared, silvered sandals on her feet, with a belt of black-and-white pearls about her waist. For all the help they offered, I could have gone naked. Perhaps I should have. She drank deep.\nDescendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth, the Pureborn commanded the Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas. Daenerys Targaryen had wanted that fleet, or part of it, and some of their soldiers as well. She made the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List, sent the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door, and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones.\nThe Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors, rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth\u2019s vanished glory. The chairs were immense, fantastically carved, bright with goldwork and studded with amber, onyx, lapis, and jade, each one different from all the others, and each striving to be the most fabulous. Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-weary that they might have been asleep. They listened, but they did not hear, or care, she thought. They are Milk Men indeed. They never meant to help me. They came because they were curious. They came because they were bored, and the dragon on my shoulder interested them more than I did.\n\u201cTell me the words of the Pureborn,\u201d prompted Xaro Xhoan Daxos. \u201cTell me what they said to sadden the queen of my heart.\u201d\n\u201cThey said no.\u201d The wine tasted of pomegranates and hot summer days. \u201cThey said it with great courtesy, to be sure, but under all the lovely words, it was still no.\u201d\n\u201cDid you flatter them?\u201d\n\u201cShamelessly.\u201d\n\u201cDid you weep?\u201d\n\u201cThe blood of the dragon does not weep,\u201d she said testily.\nXaro sighed. \u201cYou ought to have wept.\u201d The Qartheen wept often and easily; it was considered a mark of the civilized man. \u201cThe men we bought, what did they say?\u201d\n\u201cMathos said nothing. Wendello praised the way I spoke. The Exquisite refused me with the rest, but he wept afterward.\u201d\n\u201cAlas, that Qartheen should be so faithless.\u201d Xaro was not himself of the Pureborn, but he had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer. \u201cWeep, weep, for the treachery of men.\u201d\nDany would sooner have wept for her gold. The bribes she\u2019d tendered to Mathos Mallarawan, Wendello Qar Deeth, and Egon Emeros the Exquisite might have bought her a ship, or hired a score of sellswords. \u201cSuppose I sent Ser Jorah to demand the return of my gifts?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cSuppose a Sorrowful Man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept,\u201d said Xaro. The Sorrowful Men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins, so named because they always whispered, \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d to their victims before they killed them. The Qartheen were nothing if not polite. \u201cIt is wisely said that it is easier to milk the Stone Cow of Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn.\u201d\nDany did not know where Faros was, but it seemed to her that Qarth was full of stone cows. The merchant princes, grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas, were divided into three jealous factions: the Ancient Guild of Spicers, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, and the Thirteen, to which Xaro belonged. Each vied with the others for dominance, and all three contended endlessly with the Pureborn. And brooding over all were the warlocks, with their blue lips and dread powers, seldom seen but much feared.\nShe would have been lost without Xaro. The gold that she had squandered to open the doors of the Hall of a Thousand Thrones was largely a product of the merchant\u2019s generosity and quick wits. As the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east, ever more seekers had come to learn if the tale was true\u2014and Xaro Xhoan Daxos saw to it that the great and the humble alike offered some token to the Mother of Dragons.\nThe trickle he started soon swelled to a flood. Trader captains brought lace from Myr, chests of saffron from Yi Ti, amber and dragonglass out of Asshai. Merchants offered bags of coin, silversmiths rings and chains. Pipers piped for her, tumblers tumbled, and jugglers juggled, while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed. A pair of Jogos Nhai presented her with one of their striped zorses, black and white and fierce. A widow brought the dried corpse of her husband, covered with a crust of silvered leaves; such remnants were believed to have great power, especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer, as this one had. And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a three-headed dragon; the coils were yellow gold, the wings silver, the heads carved from jade, ivory, and onyx.\nThe crown was the only offering she\u2019d kept. The rest she sold, to gather the wealth she had wasted on the Pureborn. Xaro would have sold the crown too\u2014the Thirteen would see that she had a much finer one, he swore\u2014but Dany forbade it. \u201cViserys sold my mother\u2019s crown, and men called him a beggar. I shall keep this one, so men will call me a queen.\u201d And so she did, though the weight of it made her neck ache.\nYet even crowned, I am a beggar still, Dany thought. I have become the most splendid beggar in the world, but a beggar all the same. She hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the Usurper\u2019s knives, pleading for help from archons and princes and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how they mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had driven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the dead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have the dragons. The dragons are all the difference.\nShe stroked Rhaegal. The green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard. Outside, the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed, all its myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea. \u201cMake way, you Milk Men, make way for the Mother of Dragons,\u201d Jhogo cried, and the Qartheen moved aside, though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice. Through the swaying draperies, Dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion. From time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given him. Aggo guarded on her other side, while Rakharo rode behind the procession, watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger. Ser Jorah she had left behind today, to guard her other dragons; the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start. He distrusts everyone, she reflected, and perhaps for good reason.\nAs Dany lifted her goblet to drink, Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back, hissing. \u201cYour dragon has a good nose.\u201d Xaro wiped his lips. \u201cThe wine is ordinary. It is said that across the Jade Sea they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines taste like vinegar. Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it, you and I.\u201d\n\u201cThe Arbor makes the best wine in the world,\u201d Dany declared. Lord Redwyne had fought for her father against the Usurper, she remembered, one of the few to remain true to the last. Will he fight for me as well? There was no way to be certain after so many years. \u201cCome with me to the Arbor, Xaro, and you\u2019ll have the finest vintages you ever tasted. But we\u2019ll need to go in a warship, not a pleasure barge.\u201d\n\u201cI have no warships. War is bad for trade. Many times I have told you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of peace.\u201d\nXaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of gold, she thought, and gold will buy me all the ships and swords I need. \u201cI have not asked you to take up a sword, only to lend me your ships.\u201d\nHe smiled modestly. \u201cOf trading ships I have a few, that is so. Who can say how many? One may be sinking even now, in some stormy corner of the Summer Sea. On the morrow, another will fall afoul of corsairs. The next day, one of my captains may look at the wealth in his hold and think, All this should belong to me. Such are the perils of trade. Why, the longer we talk, the fewer ships I am likely to have. I grow poorer by the instant.\u201d\n\u201cGive me ships, and I will make you rich again.\u201d\n\u201cMarry me, bright light, and sail the ship of my heart. I cannot sleep at night for thinking of your beauty.\u201d\nDany smiled. Xaro\u2019s flowery protestations of passion amused her, but his manner was at odds with his words. While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare breast when he\u2019d helped her into the palanquin, Xaro hardly deigned to notice it, even in these close confines. And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince, flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk. \u201cYou speak sweetly, Xaro, but under your words I hear another no.\u201d\n\u201cThis Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard. I cannot bear the thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin.\u201d The jewels in Xaro\u2019s nose gave him the aspect of some strange glittery bird. His long, elegant fingers waved dismissal. \u201cLet this be your kingdom, most exquisite of queens, and let me be your king. I will give you a throne of gold, if you like. When Qarth begins to pall, we can journey round Yi Ti and search for the dreaming city of the poets, to sip the wine of wisdom from a dead man\u2019s skull.\u201d\n\u201cI mean to sail to Westeros, and drink the wine of vengeance from the skull of the Usurper.\u201d She scratched Rhaegal under one eye, and his jade-green wings unfolded for a moment, stirring the still air in the palanquin.\nA single perfect tear ran down the cheek of Xaro Xhoan Daxos. \u201cWill nothing turn you from this madness?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, wishing she was as certain as she sounded. \u201cIf each of the Thirteen would lend me ten ships\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou would have one hundred thirty ships, and no crew to sail them. The justice of your cause means naught to the common men of Qarth. Why should my sailors care who sits upon the throne of some kingdom at the edge of the world?\u201d\n\u201cI will pay them to care.\u201d\n\u201cWith what coin, sweet star of my heaven?\u201d\n\u201cWith the gold the seekers bring.\u201d\n\u201cThat you may do,\u201d Xaro acknowledged, \u201cbut so much caring will cost dear. You will need to pay them far more than I do, and all of Qarth laughs at my ruinous generosity.\u201d\n\u201cIf the Thirteen will not aid me, perhaps I should ask the Guild of Spicers or the Tourmaline Brotherhood?\u201d\nXaro gave a languid shrug. \u201cThey will give you nothing but flattery and lies. The Spicers are dissemblers and braggarts and the Brotherhood is full of pirates.\u201d\n\u201cThen I must heed Pyat Pree, and go to the warlocks.\u201d\nThe merchant prince sat up sharply. \u201cPyat Pree has blue lips, and it is truly said that blue lips speak only lies. Heed the wisdom of one who loves you. Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows. They will give you naught. They have naught to give.\u201d\n\u201cI would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend Xaro Xhoan Daxos would give me what I ask.\u201d\n\u201cI have given you my home and heart, do they mean nothing to you? I have given you perfume and pomegranates, tumbling monkeys and spitting snakes, scrolls from lost Valyria, an idol\u2019s head and a serpent\u2019s foot. I have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold, and a matched set of bullocks to bear it, one white as ivory and one black as jet, with horns inlaid with jewels.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dany said. \u201cBut it was ships and soldiers I wanted.\u201d\n\u201cDid I not give you an army, sweetest of women? A thousand knights, each in shining armor.\u201d\nThe armor had been made of silver and gold, the knights of jade and beryl and onyx and tourmaline, of amber and opal and amethyst, each as tall as her little finger. \u201cA thousand lovely knights,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not the sort my enemies need fear. And my bullocks cannot carry me across the water, I\u2014why are we stopping?\u201d The oxen had slowed notably.\n\u201cKhaleesi,\u201d Aggo called through the drapes as the palanquin jerked to a sudden halt. Dany rolled onto an elbow to lean out. They were on the fringes of the bazaar, the way ahead blocked by a solid wall of people. \u201cWhat are they looking at?\u201d\nJhogo rode back to her. \u201cA firemage, Khaleesi.\u201d\n\u201cI want to sec.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must.\u201d The Dothraki offered a hand down. When she took it, he pulled her up onto his horse and sat her in front of him, where she could see over the heads of the crowd. The firemage had conjured a ladder in the air, a crackling orange ladder of swirling flame that rose unsupported from the floor of the bazaar, reaching toward the high latticed roof.\nMost of the spectators, she noticed, were not of the city: she saw sailors off trading ships, merchants come by caravan, dusty men out of the red waste, wandering soldiers, craftsmen, slavers. Jhogo, slid one hand about her waist and leaned close. \u201cThe Milk Men shun him. Khaleesi, do you see the girl in the felt hat? There, behind the fat priest. She is a\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014cutpurse,\u201d finished Dany. She was no pampered lady, blind to such things. She had seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the Free Cities, during the years she\u2019d spent with her brother, running from the Usurper\u2019s hired knives.\nThe mage was gesturing, urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of his arms. As the watchers craned their necks upward, the cutpurses squirmed through the press, small blades hidden in their palms. They relieved the prosperous of their coin with one hand while pointing upward with the other.\nWhen the fiery ladder stood forty feet high, the mage leapt forward and began to climb it, scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey. Each rung he touched dissolved behind him, leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke. When he reached the top, the ladder was gone and so was he.\n\u201cA fine trick,\u201d announced Jhogo with admiration.\n\u201cNo trick,\u201d a woman said in the Common Tongue.\nDany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd, yet there she stood, eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask. \u201cWhat mean you, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cHalf a year gone, that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass. He had some small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work. He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets.\u201d\nDany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood. Even the smoke was gone now, and the crowd was breaking up, each man going about his business. In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty. \u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cAnd now his powers grow, Khaleesi. And you are the cause of it.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d She laughed. \u201cHow could that be?\u201d\nThe woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou are the Mother of Dragons, are you not?\u201d\n\u201cShe is, and no spawn of shadows may touch her.\u201d Jhogo brushed Quaithe\u2019s fingers away with the handle of his whip.\nThe woman took a step backward. \u201cYou must leave this city soon, Daenerys Targaryen, or you will never be permitted to leave it at all.\u201d\nDany\u2019s wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched her. \u201cWhere would you have me go?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cTo go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\u201d\nAsshai, Dany thought. She would have me go to Asshai. \u201cWill the Asshai\u2019i give me an army?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWill there be gold for me in Asshai? Will there be ships? What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth?\u201d\n\u201cTruth,\u201d said the woman in the mask. And bowing, she faded back into the crowd.\nRakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios. \u201cKhaleesi, better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows, who dare not show their face beneath the sun. It is known.\u201d\n\u201cIt is known,\u201d Aggo agreed.\nXaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions. When Dany climbed back into the palanquin beside him, he said, \u201cYour savages are wiser than they know. Such truths as the Asshai\u2019i hoard are not like to make you smile.\u201d Then he pressed another cup of wine on her, and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse.\nIn the quiet of her chambers, Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk. Her dragons were hungry, so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier. They are growing, she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the blackened flesh. They must weigh twice what they had in Vaes Tolorro. Even so, it would be years before they were large enough to take to war. And they must be trained as well, or they will lay my kingdom waste. For all her Targaryen blood, Dany had not the least idea of how to train a dragon.\nSer Jorah Mormont came to her as the sun was going down. \u201cThe Pureborn refused you?\u201d\n\u201cAs you said they would. Come, sit, give me your counsel.\u201d Dany drew him down to the cushions beside her, and Jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine.\n\u201cYou will get no help in this city, Khaleesi.\u201d Ser Jorah took an onion between thumb and forefinger. \u201cEach day I am more convinced of that than the day before. The Pureborn see no farther than the walls of Qarth, and Xaro\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me to marry him again.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I know why.\u201d When the knight frowned, his heavy black brows joined together above his deep-set eyes.\n\u201cHe dreams of me, day and night.\u201d She laughed.\n\u201cForgive me, my queen, but it is your dragons he dreams of.\u201d\n\u201cXaro assures me that in Qarth, man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed. The dragons are mine.\u201d She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her.\n\u201cHe tells it true as far as it goes, but there\u2019s one thing he failed to mention. The Qartheen have a curious wedding custom, my queen. On the day of their union, a wife may ask a token of love from her husband. Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods, he must grant. And he may ask the same of her. One thing only may be asked, but whatever is named may not be denied.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd it may not be denied?\u201d\n\u201cWith one dragon, Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city, but one ship will further our cause but little.\u201d\nDany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men. \u201cWe passed through the bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones,\u201d she told Ser Jorah. \u201cQuaithe was there.\u201d She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder, and what the woman in the red mask had told her.\n\u201cI would be glad to leave this city, if truth be told,\u201d the knight said when she was done. \u201cBut not for Asshai.\u201d\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\n\u201cEast,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am half a world away from my kingdom even here. If I go any farther east I may never find my way home to Westeros.\u201d\n\u201cIf you go west, you risk your life.\u201d\n\u201cHouse Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cTruer friends than Xaro or the Pureborn.\u201d\n\u201cIf you mean Illyrio Mopatis, I wonder. For sufficient gold, Illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would a slave.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother and I were guests in Illyrio\u2019s manse for half a year. If he meant to sell us, he could have done it then.\u201d\n\u201cHe did sell you,\u201d Ser Jorah said. \u201cTo Khal Drogo.\u201d\nDany flushed. He had the truth of it, but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it. \u201cIllyrio protected us from the Usurper\u2019s knives, and he believed in my brother\u2019s cause.\u201d\n\u201cIllyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio. Gluttons are greedy men as a rule, and magisters are devious. Illyrio Mopatis is both. What do you truly know of him?\u201d\n\u201cI know that he gave me my dragon eggs.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cIf he\u2019d known they were like to hatch, he\u2019d would have sat on them himself.\u201d\nThat made her smile despite herself. \u201cOh, I have no doubt of that, ser. I know Illyrio better than you think. I was a child when I left his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars, but I was neither deaf nor blind. And I am no child now.\u201d\n\u201cEven if Illyrio is the friend you think him,\u201d the knight said stubbornly, \u201che is not powerful enough to enthrone you by himself, no more than he could your brother.\u201d\n\u201cHe is rich,\u201d she said. \u201cNot so rich as Xaro, perhaps, but rich enough to hire ships for me, and men as well.\u201d\n\u201cSellswords have their uses,\u201d Ser Jorah admitted, \u201cbut you will not win your father\u2019s throne with sweepings from the Free Cities. Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil.\u201d\n\u201cI am their rightful queen,\u201d Dany protested.\n\u201cYou are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the Common Tongue. The lords of Westeros do not know you, and have every reason to fear and mistrust you. You must win them over before you sail. A few at least.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how am I to do that, if I go east as you counsel?\u201d\nHe ate an olive and spit out the pit into his palm. \u201cI do not know, Your Grace,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut I do know that the longer you remain in one place, the easier it will be for your enemies to find you. The name Targaryen still frightens them, so much so that they sent a man to murder you when they heard you were with child. What will they do when they learn of your dragons?\u201d\nDrogon was curled up beneath her arm, as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun. Rhaegal and Viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat, buffeting each other with their wings as smoke hissed from their nostrils. My furious children, she thought. They must not come to harm. \u201cThe comet led me to Qarth for a reason. I had hoped to find my army here, but it seems that will not be. What else remains, I ask myself?\u201d I am afraid, she realized, but I must be brave. \u201cCome the morrow, you must go to Pyat Pree.\u201d",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThe girl never wept. Young as she was, Myrcella Baratheon was a princess born. And a Lannister, despite her name, Tyrion reminded himself, as much Jaime\u2019s blood as Cersei\u2019s.\nTo be sure, her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on the deck of the Seaswift, but the girl knew the proper words to say, and she said them with courage and dignity. When the time came to part, it was Prince Tommen who cried, and Myrcella who gave him comfort.\nTyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of King Robert\u2019s Hammer, a great war galley of four hundred oars. Rob\u2019s Hammer, as her oarsmen called her, would form the main strength of Myrcella\u2019s escort. Lionstar, Bold Wind, and Lady Lyanna would sail with her as well.\nIt made Tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already inadequate fleet, depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with Lord Stannis to Dragonstone and never returned, but Cersei would hear of nothing less. Perhaps she was wise. If the girl was captured before she reached Sunspear, the Dornish alliance would fall to pieces. So far Doran Martell had done no more than call his banners. Once Myrcella was safe in Braavos, he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes, where the threat might make some of the Marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give Stannis pause about marching north. It was purely a feint, however. The Martells would not commit to actual battle unless Dorne itself was attacked, and Stannis was not so great a fool. Though some of his bannermen may be, Tyrion reflected. I should think on that.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cYou know your orders, Captain.\u201d\n\u201cI do, my lord. We are to follow the coast, staying always in sight of land, until we reach Crackclaw Point. From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos. On no account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless?\u201d\n\u201cIf a single ship, we are to run them off or destroy them. If there are more, the Bold Wind will cleave to the Seaswift to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle.\u201d\nTyrion nodded. If the worst happened, the little Seaswift ought to be able to outrun pursuit. A small ship with big sails, she was faster than any warship afloat, or so her captain had claimed. Once Myrcella reached Braavos, she ought to be safe. He was sending Ser Arys Oakheart as her sworn shield, and had engaged the Braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to Sunspear. Even Lord Stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most powerful of the Free Cities. Traveling from King\u2019s Landing to Dorne by way of Braavos was scarcely the most direct of routes, but it was the safest\u2026 or so he hoped.\nIf Lord Stannis knew of this sailing, he could not choose a better time to send his fleet against us. Tyrion glanced back to where the Rush emptied out into Blackwater Bay and was relieved to see no signs of sails on the wide green horizon. At last report, the Baratheon fleet still lay off Storm\u2019s End, where Ser Cortnay Penrose continued to defy the besiegers in dead Renly\u2019s name. Meanwhile, Tyrion\u2019s winch towers stood three-quarters complete. Even now men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place, no doubt cursing him for making them work through the festivities. Let them curse. Another fortnight, Stannis, that\u2019s all I require. Another fortnight and it will be done.\nTyrion watched his niece kneel before the High Septon to receive his blessing on her voyage. Sunlight caught in his crystal crown and spilled rainbows across Myrcella\u2019s upturned face. The noise from the riverside made it impossible to hear the prayers. He hoped the gods had sharper ears. The High Septon was as fat as a house, and more pompous and long of wind than even Pycelle. Enough, old man, make an end to it, Tyrion thought irritably. The gods have better things to do than listen to you, and so do I.\nWhen at last the droning and mumbling was done, Tyrion took his farewell of the captain of Rob\u2019s Hammer. \u201cDeliver my niece safely to Braavos, and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your return,\u201d he promised.\nAs he made his way down the steep plank to the quay, Tyrion could feel unkind eyes upon him. The galley rocked gently and the movement underfoot made his waddle worse than ever. I\u2019ll wager they\u2019d love to snigger. No one dared, not openly, though he heard mutterings mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings. They do not love me, he thought. Well, small wonder. I\u2019m well fed and ugly, and they are starving.\nBronn escorted him through the crowd to join his sister and her sons. Cersei ignored him, preferring to lavish her smiles on their cousin. He watched her charming Lancel with eyes as green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat, and smiled a small sly smile to himself. I know your secret, Cersei, he thought. His sister had oft called upon the High Septon of late, to seek the blessings of the gods in their coming struggle with Lord Stannis\u2026 or so she would have him believe. In truth, after a brief call at the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei would don a plain brown traveler\u2019s cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the unlikely name of Ser Osmund Kettleblack, and his equally unsavory brothers Osney and Osfryd. Lancel had told him all about them. Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy her own force of sellswords.\nWell, let her enjoy her plots. She was much sweeter when she thought she was outwitting him. The Kettleblacks would charm her, take her coin, and promise her anything she asked, and why not, when Bronn was matching every copper penny, coin for coin? Amiable rogues all three, the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than they\u2019d ever been at bloodletting. Cersei had managed to buy herself three hollow drums; they would make all the fierce booming sounds she required, but there was nothing inside. It amused Tyrion no end.\nHorns blew fanfares as Lionstar and Lady Lyanna pushed out from shore, moving downriver to clear the way for Seaswift. A few cheers went up from the crush along the banks, as thin and ragged as the clouds scuttling overhead. Myrcella smiled and waved from the deck. Behind her stood Arys Oakheart, his white cloak streaming. The captain ordered lines cast off, and oars pushed the Seaswift out into the lusty current of the Blackwater Rush, where her sails blossomed in the wind\u2014common white sails, as Tyrion had insisted, not sheets of Lannister crimson. Prince Tommen sobbed. \u201cYou mew like a suckling babe,\u201d his brother hissed at him. \u201cPrinces aren\u2019t supposed to cry.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon,\u201d Sansa Stark said, \u201cand the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, or I\u2019ll have Ser Meryn give you a mortal wound,\u201d Joffrey told his betrothed. Tyrion glanced at his sister, but Cersei was engrossed in something Ser Balon Swann was telling her. Can she truly be so blind as to what he is? he wondered.\nOut on the river, Bold Wind unshipped her oars and glided downstream in the wake of Seaswift. Last came King Robert\u2019s Hammer, the might of the royal fleet\u2026 or at least that portion that had not fled to Dragonstone last year with Stannis. Tyrion had chosen the ships with care, avoiding any whose captains might be of doubtful loyalty, according to Varys\u2026 but as Varys himself was of doubtful loyalty, a certain amount of apprehension remained. I rely too much on Varys, he reflected. I need my own informers. Not that I\u2019d trust them either. Trust would get you killed.\nHe wondered again about Littlefinger. There had been no word from Petyr Baelish since he had ridden off for Bitterbridge. That might mean nothing\u2014or everything. Even Varys could not say. The eunuch had suggested that perhaps Littlefinger had met some misfortune on the roads. He might even be slain. Tyrion had snorted in derision. \u201cIf Littlefinger is dead, then I\u2019m a giant.\u201d More likely, the Tyrells were balking at the proposed marriage. Tyrion could scarcely blame them. If I were Mace Tyrell, I would sooner have Joffrey\u2019s head on a pike than his cock in my daughter.\nThe little fleet was well out into the bay when Cersei indicated that it was time to go. Bronn brought Tyrion\u2019s horse and helped him mount. That was Podrick Payne\u2019s task, but they had left Pod back at the Red Keep. The gaunt sellsword made for a much more reassuring presence than the boy would have.\nThe narrow streets were lined by men of the City Watch, holding back the crowd with the shafts of their spears. Ser Jacelyn Bywater went in front, heading a wedge of mounted lancers in black ringmail and golden cloaks. Behind him came Ser Aron Santagar and Ser Balon Swann, bearing the king\u2019s banners, the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon.\nKing Joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey, a golden crown set upon his golden curls. Sansa Stark rode a chesnut mare at his side, looking neither right nor left, her thick auburn hair flowing to her shoulders beneath a net of moonstones. Two of the Kingsguard flanked the couple, the Hound on the king\u2019s right hand and Ser Mandon Moore to the left of the Stark girl.\nNext came Tommen, snuffling, with Ser Preston Greenfield in his white armor and cloak, and then Cersei, accompanied by Ser Lancel and protected by Meryn Trant and Boros Blount. Tyrion fell in with his sister. After them followed the High Septon in his litter, and a long tail of other courtiers\u2014Ser Horas Redwyne, Lady Tanda and her daughter, Jalabhar Xho, Lord Gyles Rosby, and the rest. A double column of guardsmen brought up the rear.\nThe unshaven and the unwashed stared at the riders with dull resentment from behind the line of spears. I like this not one speck, Tyrion thought. Bronn had a score of sellswords scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before it started. Perhaps Cersei had similarly disposed her Kettleblacks. Somehow Tyrion did not think it would help much. If the fire was too hot, you could hardly keep the pudding from scorching by tossing a handful of raisins in the pot.\nThey crossed Fishmonger\u2019s Square and rode along Muddy Way before turning onto the narrow, curving Hook to begin their climb up Aegon\u2019s High Hill. A few voices raised a cry of \u201cJoffrey! All hail, all hail!\u201d as the young king rode by, but for every man who picked up the shout, a hundred kept their silence. The Lannisters moved through a sea of ragged men and hungry women, breasting a tide of sullen eyes. Just ahead of him, Cersei was laughing at something Lancel had said, though he suspected her merriment was feigned. She could not be oblivious to the unrest around them, but his sister always believed in putting on the brave show.\nHalfway along the route, a wailing woman forced her way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions, holding the corpse of her dead baby above her head. It was blue and swollen, grotesque, but the real horror was the mother\u2019s eyes. Joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down, but Sansa Stark leaned over and said something to him. The king fumbled in his purse, and flung the woman a silver stag. The coin bounced off the child and rolled away, under the legs of the gold cloaks and into the crowd, where a dozen men began to fight for it. The mother never once blinked. Her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son.\n\u201cLeave her, Your Grace,\u201d Cersei called out to the king, \u201cshe\u2019s beyond our help, poor thing.\u201d\nThe mother heard her. Somehow the queen\u2019s voice cut through the woman\u2019s ravaged wits. Her slack face twisted in loathing. \u201cWhore!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cKingslayer\u2019s whore! Brotherfucker!\u201d Her dead child dropped from her arms like a sack of flour as she pointed at Cersei. \u201cBrotherfucker brotherfucker brotherfucker.\u201d\nTyrion never saw who threw the dung. He only heard Sansa\u2019s gasp and Joffrey\u2019s bellowed curse, and when he turned his head, the king was wiping brown filth from his cheek. There was more caked in his golden hair and spattered over Sansa\u2019s legs.\n\u201cWho threw that?\u201d Joffrey screamed. He pushed his fingers into his hair, made a furious face, and flung away another handful of dung. \u201cI want the man who threw that!\u201d he shouted. \u201cA hundred golden dragons to the man who gives him up.\u201d\n\u201cHe was up there!\u201d someone shouted from the crowd. The king wheeled his horse in a circle to survey the rooftops and open balconies above them. In the crowd people were pointing, shoving, cursing one another and the king.\n\u201cPlease, Your Grace, let him go,\u201d Sansa pleaded.\nThe king paid her no heed. \u201cBring me the man who flung that filth!\u201d Joffrey commanded. \u201cHe\u2019ll lick it off me or I\u2019ll have his head. Dog, you bring him here!\u201d\nObedient, Sandor Clegane swung down from his saddle, but there was no way through that wall of flesh, let alone to the roof. Those closest to him began to squirm and shove to get away, while others pushed forward to see. Tyrion smelled disaster. \u201cClegane, leave off, the man is long fled.\u201d\n\u201cI want him!\u201d Joffrey pointed at the roof. \u201cHe was up there! Dog, cut through them and bring\u2014\u201d\nA tumult of sound drowned his last words, a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed them from all sides. \u201cBastard!\u201d someone screamed at Joffrey, \u201cbastard monster.\u201d Other voices flung calls of \u201cWhore\u201d and \u201cBrotherfucker\u201d at the queen, while Tyrion was pelted with shouts of \u201cFreak\u201d and \u201cHalfman.\u201d Mixed in with the abuse, he heard a few cries of \u201cJustice\u201d and \u201cRobb, King Robb, the Young Wolf,\u201d of \u201cStannis!\u201d and even \u201cRenly!\u201d From both sides of the street, the crowd surged against the spear shafts while the gold cloaks struggled to hold the line. Stones and dung and fouler things whistled overhead. \u201cFeed us!\u201d a woman shrieked. \u201cBread!\u201d boomed a man behind her. \u201cWe want bread, bastard!\u201d In a heartbeat, a thousand voices took up the chant. King Joffrey and King Robb and King Stannis were forgotten, and King Bread ruled alone. \u201cBread,\u201d they clamored. \u201cBread, bread!\u201d\nTyrion spurred to his sister\u2019s side, yelling, \u201cBack to the castle. Now.\u201d Cersei gave a curt nod, and Ser Lancel unsheathed his sword. Ahead of the column, Jacelyn Bywater was roaring commands. His riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge. The king was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks, grasping for him. One managed to get hold of his leg, but only for an instant. Ser Mandon\u2019s sword slashed down, parting hand from wrist. \u201cRide!\u201d Tyrion shouted at his nephew, giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump. The animal reared, trumpeting, and plunged ahead, the press shattering before him.\nTyrion drove into the gap hard on the king\u2019s hooves. Bronn kept pace, sword in hand. A jagged rock flew past his head as he rode, and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser Mandon\u2019s shield. To their left, three gold cloaks went down under the surge, and then the crowd was rushing forward, trampling the fallen men. The Hound had vanished behind, though his riderless horse galloped beside them. Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp. Ser Balon Swann dropped the Lannister lion to draw his longsword. He slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped apart, the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind. In an instant they were gone. Someone staggered in front of Joffrey\u2019s horse and shrieked as the king rode him down. Whether it had been man, woman, or child Tyrion could not have said. Joffrey was galloping at his side, whey-faced, with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on his left.\nAnd suddenly the madness was behind and they were clattering across the cobbled square that fronted on the castle barbican. A line of spearmen held the gates. Ser Jacelyn was wheeling his lances around for another charge. The spears parted to let the king\u2019s party pass under the portcullis. Pale red walls loomed up about them, reassuringly high and aswarm with crossbowmen.\nTyrion did not recall dismounting. Ser Mandon was helping the shaken king off his horse when Cersei, Tommen, and Lancel rode through the gates with Ser Meryn and Ser Boros close behind. Boros had blood smeared along his blade, while Meryn\u2019s white cloak had been torn from his back. Ser Balon Swann rode in helmetless, his mount lathered and bleeding at the mouth. Horas Redwyne brought in Lady Tanda, half crazed with fear for her daughter Lollys, who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind. Lord Gyles, more grey of face than ever, stammered out a tale of seeing the High Septon spilled from his litter, screeching prayers as the crowd swept over him. Jalabhar Xho said he thought he\u2019d seen Ser Preston Greenfield of the Kingsguard riding back toward the High Septon\u2019s overturned litter, but he was not certain.\nTyrion was dimly aware of a maester asking if he was injured. He pushed his way across the yard to where his nephew stood, his dung-encrusted crown askew. \u201cTraitors,\u201d Joffrey was babbling excitedly, \u201cI\u2019ll have all their heads, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nThe dwarf slapped his flushed face so hard the crown flew from Joffrey\u2019s head. Then he shoved him with both hands and knocked him sprawling. \u201cYou blind bloody fool.\u201d\n\u201cThey were traitors,\u201d Joffrey squealed from the ground. \u201cThey called me names and attacked me!\u201d\n\u201cYou set your dog on them! What did you imagine they would do, bend the knee meekly while the Hound lopped off some limbs? You spoiled witless little boy, you\u2019ve killed Clegane and gods know how many more, and yet you come through unscratched. Damn you!\u201d And he kicked him. It felt so good he might have done more, but Ser Mandon Moore pulled him off as Joffrey howled, and then Bronn was there to take him in hand. Cersei knelt over her son, while Ser Balon Swann restrained Ser Lancel. Tyrion wrenched free of Bronn\u2019s grip. \u201cHow many are still out there?\u201d he shouted to no one and everyone.\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d cried Lady Tanda. \u201cPlease, someone must go back for Lollys\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSer Preston is not returned,\u201d Ser Boros Blount reported, \u201cnor Aron Santagar.\u201d\n\u201cNor Wet Nurse,\u201d said Ser Horas Redwyne. That was the mocking name the other squires had hung on young Tyrek Lannister.\nTyrion glanced round the yard. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Stark girl?\u201d\nFor a moment no one answered. Finally Joffrey said, \u201cShe was riding by me. I don\u2019t know where she went.\u201d\nTyrion pressed blunt fingers into his throbbing temples. If Sansa Stark had come to harm, Jaime was as good as dead. \u201cSer Mandon, you were her shield.\u201d\nSer Mandon Moore remained untroubled. \u201cWhen they mobbed the Hound, I thought first of the king.\u201d\n\u201cAnd rightly so,\u201d Cersei put in. \u201cBoros, Meryn, go back and find the girl.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my daughter,\u201d Lady Tanda sobbed. \u201cPlease, sers\u2026\u201d\nSer Boros did not look pleased at the prospect of leaving the safety of the castle. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he told the queen, \u201cthe sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob.\u201d\nTyrion had stomached all he cared to. \u201cThe Others take your fucking cloaks! Take them off if you\u2019re afraid to wear them, you bloody oaf\u2026 but find me Sansa Stark or I swear, I\u2019ll have Shagga split that ugly head of yours in two to see if there\u2019s anything inside but black pudding.\u201d\nSer Boros went purple with rage. \u201cYou would call me ugly, you?\u201d He started to raise the bloody sword still clutched in his mailed fist. Bronn shoved Tyrion unceremoniously behind him.\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Cersei snapped. \u201cBoros, you\u2019ll do as you\u2019re bid, or we\u2019ll find someone else to wear that cloak. Your oath\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere she is!\u201d Joffrey shouted, pointing.\nSandor Clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride Sansa\u2019s chestnut courser. The girl was seated behind, both arms tight around the Hound\u2019s chest.\nTyrion called to her. \u201cAre you hurt, Lady Sansa?\u201d\nBlood was trickling down Sansa\u2019s brow from a deep gash on her scalp. \u201cThey\u2026 they were throwing things\u2026 rocks and filth, eggs\u2026 I tried to tell them, I had no bread to give them. A man tried to pull me from the saddle. The Hound killed him, I think\u2026 his arm\u2026\u201d Her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth. \u201cHe cut off his arm.\u201d\nClegane lifted her to the ground. His white cloak was torn and stained, and blood seeped through a jagged tear in his left sleeve. \u201cThe little bird\u2019s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut.\u201d Maester Frenken scurried forward to obey. \u201cThey did for Santagar,\u201d the Hound continued. \u201cFour men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone. I gutted one, not that it did Ser Aron much good.\u201d\nLady Tanda approached him. \u201cMy daughter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNever saw her.\u201d The Hound glanced around the yard, scowling. \u201cWhere\u2019s my horse? If anything\u2019s happened to that horse, someone\u2019s going to pay.\u201d\n\u201cHe was running with us for a time,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what became of him after that.\u201d\n\u201cFire!\u201d a voice screamed down from atop the barbican. \u201cMy lords, there\u2019s smoke in the city. Flea Bottom\u2019s afire.\u201d\nTyrion was inutterably weary, but there was no time for despair. \u201cBronn, take as many men as you need and see that the water wagons are not molested,\u201d Gods be good, the wildfire, if any blaze should reach that\u2026\u201cWe can lose all of Flea Bottom if we must, but on no account must the fire reach the Guildhall of the Alchemists, is that understood? Clegane, you\u2019ll go with him.\u201d\nFor half a heartbeat, Tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the Hound\u2019s dark eyes. Fire, he realized. The Others take me, of course he hates flre, he\u2019s tasted it too well. The look was gone in an instant, replaced by Clegane\u2019s familiar scowl. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said, \u201cthough not by your command. I need to find that horse.\u201d\nTyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the Kingsguard. \u201cEach of you will ride escort to a herald. Command the people to return to their homes. Any man found on the streets after the last peal of the evenfall bell will be killed.\u201d\n\u201cOur place is beside the king,\u201d Ser Meryn said, complacent.\nCersei reared up like a viper. \u201cYour place is where my brother says it is,\u201d she spit. \u201cThe Hand speaks with the king\u2019s own voice, and disobedience is treason.\u201d\nBoros and Meryn exchanged a look. \u201cShould we wear our cloaks, Your Grace?\u201d Ser Boros asked.\n\u201cGo naked for all I care. It might remind the mob that you\u2019re men. They\u2019re like to have forgotten after seeing the way you behaved out there in the street.\u201d\nTyrion let his sister rage. His head was throbbing. He thought he could smell smoke, though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying.\nTwo of the Stone Crows guarded the door of the Tower of the Hand. \u201cFind me Timett son of Timett.\u201d\n\u201cStone Crows do not run squeaking after Burned Men,\u201d one of the wildlings informed him haughtily.\nFor a moment Tyrion had forgotten who he was dealing with. \u201cThen find me Shagga.\u201d\n\u201cShagga sleeps.\u201d\nIt was an effort not to scream. \u201cWake. Him.\u201d\n\u201cIt is no easy thing to wake Shagga son of Dolf,\u201d the man complained. \u201cHis wrath is fearsome.\u201d He went off grumbling.\nThe clansman wandered in yawning and scratching. \u201cHalf the city is rioting, the other half is burning, and Shagga lies snoring,\u201d Tyrion said.\n\u201cShagga mislikes your muddy water here, so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine, and after his head hurts.\u201d\n\u201cI have Shae in a manse near the Iron Gate. I want you to go to her and keep her safe, whatever may come.\u201d\nThe huge man smiled, his teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of his beard. \u201cShagga will fetch her here.\u201d\n\u201cJust see that no harm comes to her. Tell her I will come to her as soon as I may. This very night, perhaps, or on the morrow for a certainty.\u201d\nYet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil, though Bronn reported that the fires were quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed. Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of Shae\u2019s arms, he realized he would go nowhere that night.\nSer Jacelyn Bywater delivered the butcher\u2019s bill as he was supping on a cold capon and brown bread in the gloom of his solar. Dusk had faded to darkness by then, but when his servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth, Tyrion had roared at them and sent them running. His mood was as black as the chamber, and Bywater said nothing to lighten it.\nThe list of the slain was topped by the High Septon, ripped apart as he squealed to his gods for mercy. Starving men take a hard view of priests too fat to walk, Tyrion reflected.\nSer Preston\u2019s corpse had been overlooked at first; the gold cloaks had been searching for a knight in white armor, and he had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was red-brown from head to heel.\nSer Aron Santagar had been found in a gutter, his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm.\nLady Tanda\u2019s daughter had surrendered her maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men behind a tanner\u2019s shop. The gold cloaks found her wandering naked on Sowbelly Row.\nTyrek was still missing, as was the High Septon\u2019s crystal crown. Nine gold cloaks had been slain, two score wounded. No one had troubled to count how many of the mob had died.\n\u201cI want Tyrek found, alive or dead,\u201d Tyrion said curtly when Bywater was done. \u201cHe\u2019s no more than a boy. Son to my late uncle Tygett. His father was always kind to me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find him. The septon\u2019s crown as well.\u201d\n\u201cThe Others can bugger each other with the septon\u2019s crown, for all I care.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you named me to command the Watch, you told me you wanted plain truth, always.\u201d\n\u201cSomehow I have a feeling I am not going to like whatever you\u2019re about to say,\u201d Tyrion said gloomily.\n\u201cWe held the city today, my lord, but I make no promises for the morrow. The kettle is close to boiling. So many thieves and murderers are abroad that no man\u2019s house is safe, the bloody flux is spreading in the stews along Pisswater Bend, there\u2019s no food to be had for copper nor silver. Where before you heard only mutterings from the gutter, now there\u2019s open talk of treason in guildhalls and markets.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need more men?\u201d\n\u201cI do not trust half the men I have now. Slynt tripled the size of the Watch, but it takes more than a gold cloak to make a watchman. There are good men and loyal among the new recruits, but also more brutes, sots, cravens, and traitors than you\u2019d care to know. They\u2019re half-trained and undisciplined, and what loyalty they have is to their own skins. If it comes to battle, they\u2019ll not hold, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cI never expected them to,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cOnce our walls are breeched, we are lost, I\u2019ve known that from the start.\u201d\n\u201cMy men are largely drawn from the smallfolk. They walk the same streets, drink in the same winesinks, spoon down their bowls of brown in the same pot-shops. Your eunuch must have told you, there is small love for the Lannisters in King\u2019s Landing. Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city, when Aerys opened the gates to him. They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House\u2014for your brother\u2019s murder of King Aerys, for the butchery of Rhaegar\u2019s children, for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey\u2019s justice. Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king, and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne. In pot-shops and winesinks and brothels, you hear these things\u2014and in the barracks and guardhalls as well, I fear.\u201d\n\u201cThey hate my family, is that what you are telling me?\u201d\n\u201cAye\u2026 and will turn on them, if the chance comes.\u201d\n\u201cMe as well?\u201d\n\u201cAsk your eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you.\u201d\nBywater\u2019s deep-set eyes met the dwarf\u2019s mismatched ones, and did not blink. \u201cYou most of all, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cMost of all?\u201d The injustice was like to choke him. \u201cIt was Joffrey who told them to eat their dead, Joffrey who set his dog on them. How could they blame me?\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is but a boy. In the streets, it is said that he has evil councillors. The queen has never been known as a friend to the commons, nor is Lord Varys called the Spider out of love\u2026 but it is you they blame most. Your sister and the eunuch were here when times were better under King Robert, but you were not. They say that you\u2019ve filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages, brutes who take what they want and follow no laws but their own. They say you exiled Janos Slynt because you found him too bluff and honest for your liking. They say you threw wise and gentle Pycelle into the dungeons when he dared raise his voice against you. Some even claim that you mean to seize the Iron Throne for your own.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I am a monster besides, hideous and misshapen, never forget that.\u201d His hand coiled into a fist. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough. We both have work to attend to. Leave me.\u201d\nPerhaps my lord father was right to despise me all these years, if this is the best I can achieve, Tyrion thought when he was alone. He stared down at the remains of his supper, his belly roiling at the sight of the cold greasy capon. Disgusted, he pushed it away, shouted for Pod, and sent the boy running to summon Varys and Bronn. My most trusted advisers are a eunuch and a sellsword, and my lady\u2019s a whore. What does that say of me?\nBronn complained of the gloom when he arrived, and insisted on a fire in the hearth. It was blazing by the time Varys made his appearance. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Tyrion demanded.\n\u201cAbout the king\u2019s business, my sweet lord.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, the king,\u201d Tyrion muttered. \u201cMy nephew is not fit to sit a privy, let alone the Iron Throne.\u201d\nVarys shrugged. \u201cAn apprentice must be taught his trade.\u201d\n\u201cHalf the \u2019prentices on Reeking Lane could rule better than this king of yours.\u201d Bronn seated himself across the table and pulled a wing off the capon.\nTyrion had made a practice of ignoring the sellsword\u2019s frequent insolences, but tonight he found it galling. \u201cI don\u2019t recall giving you leave to finish my supper.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t look to be eating it,\u201d Bronn said through a mouthful of meat. \u201cCity\u2019s starving, it\u2019s a crime to waste food. You have any wine?\u201d\nNext he\u2019ll want me to pour it for him, Tyrion thought darkly. \u201cYou go too far,\u201d he warned.\n\u201cAnd you never go far enough.\u201d Bronn tossed the wingbone to the rushes. \u201cEver think how easy life would be if the other one had been born first?\u201d He thrust his fingers inside the capon and tore off a handful of breast. \u201cThe weepy one, Tommen. Seems like he\u2019d do whatever he was told, as a good king should.\u201d\nA chill crept down Tyrion\u2019s spine as he realized what the sellsword was hinting at. If Tommen was king\u2026\nThere was only one way Tommen would become king. No, he could not even think it. Joffrey was his own blood, and Jaime\u2019s son as much as Cersei\u2019s. \u201cI could have your head off for saying that,\u201d he told Bronn, but the sellsword only laughed.\n\u201cFriends,\u201d said Varys, \u201cquarreling will not serve us. I beg you both, take heart.\u201d\n\u201cWhose?\u201d asked Tyrion sourly. He could think of several tempting choices.",

      "content": "Davos\nSer Cortnay Penrose wore no armor. He sat a sorrel stallion, his standard-bearer a dapple grey. Above them flapped Baratheon\u2019s crowned stag and the crossed quills of Penrose, white on a russet field. Ser Cortnay\u2019s spade-shaped beard was russet as well, though he\u2019d gone wholly bald on top. If the size and splendor of the king\u2019s party impressed him, it did not show on that weathered face.\nThey trotted up with much clinking of chain and rattle of plate. Even Davos wore mail, though he could not have said why; his shoulders and lower back ached from the unaccustomed weight. It made him feel cumbered and foolish, and he wondered once more why he was here. It is not for me to question the king\u2019s commands, and yet\u2026\nEvery man of the party was of better birth and higher station than Davos Seaworth, and the great lords glittered in the morning sun. Silvered steel and gold inlay brightened their armor, and their warhelms were crested in a riot of silken plumes, feathers, and cunningly wrought heraldic beasts with gemstone eyes. Stannis himself looked out of place in this rich and royal company. Like Davos, the king was plainly garbed in wool and boiled leather, though the circlet of red gold about his temples lent him a certain grandeur. Sunlight flashed off its flame-shaped points whenever he moved his head.\nThis was the closest Davos had come to His Grace in the eight days since Black Betha had joined the rest of the fleet off Storm\u2019s End. He\u2019d sought an audience within an hour of his arrival, only to be told that the king was occupied. The king was often occupied, Davos learned from his son Devan, one of the royal squires. Now that Stannis Baratheon had come into his power, the lordlings buzzed around him like flies round a corpse. He looks half a corpse too, years older than when I left Dragonstone. Devan said the king scarcely slept of late. \u201cSince Lord Renly died, he has been troubled by terrible nightmares,\u201d the boy had confided to his father. \u201cMaester\u2019s potions do not touch them. Only the Lady Melisandre can soothe him to sleep.\u201d\nIs that why she shares his pavilion now? Davos wondered. To pray with him? Or does she have another way to soothe him to sleep? it was an unworthy question, and one he dared not ask, even of his own son. Devan was a good boy, but he wore the flaming heart proudly on his doublet, and his father had seen him at the nightfires as dusk fell, beseeching the Lord of Light to bring the dawn. He is the king\u2019s squire, he told himself, it is only to be expected that he would take the king\u2019s god.\nDavos had almost forgotten how high and thick the walls of Storm\u2019s End loomed up close. King Stannis halted beneath them, a few feet from Ser Cortnay and his standard-bearer. \u201cSer,\u201d he said with stiff courtesy. He made no move to dismount.\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d That was less courteous, but not unexpected.\n\u201cIt is customary to grant a king the style Your Grace,\u201d announced Lord Florent. A red gold fox poked its shining snout out from his breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli flowers. Very tall, very courtly, and very rich, the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first of Renly\u2019s bannermen to declare for Stannis, and the first to renounce his old gods and take up the Lord of Light. Stannis had left his queen on Dragonstone along with her uncle Axell, but the queen\u2019s men were more numerous and powerful than ever, and Alester Florent was the foremost.\nSer Cortnay Penrose ignored him, preferring to address Stannis. \u201cThis is a notable company. The great lords Estermont, Errol, and Varner. Ser Jon of the green-apple Fossoways and Ser Bryan of the red. Lord Caron and Ser Guyard of King Renly\u2019s Rainbow Guard\u2026 and the puissant Lord Alester Florent of Brightwater, to be sure. Is that your Onion Knight I spy to the rear? Well met, Ser Davos. I fear I do not know the lady.\u201d\n\u201cI am named Melisandre, ser.\u201d She alone came unarmored, but for her flowing red robes. At her throat the great ruby drank the daylight. \u201cI serve your king, and the Lord of Light.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you well of them, my lady,\u201d Ser Cortnay answered, \u201cbut I bow to other gods, and a different king.\u201d\n\u201cThere is but one true king, and one true god,\u201d announced Lord Florent.\n\u201cAre we here to dispute theology, my lord? Had I known, I would have brought a septon.\u201d\n\u201cYou know full well why we are here,\u201d said Stannis. \u201cYou have had a fortnight to consider my offer. You sent your ravens. No help has come. Nor will it. Storm\u2019s End stands alone, and I am out of patience. One last time, ser, I command you to open your gates, and deliver me that which is mine by rights.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the terms?\u201d asked Ser Cortnay.\n\u201cRemain as before,\u201d said Stannis. \u201cI will pardon you for your treason, as I have pardoned these lords you see behind me. The men of your garrison will be free to enter my service or to return unmolested to their homes. You may keep your weapons and as much property as a man can carry. I will require your horses and pack animals, however.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of Edric Storm?\u201d\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s bastard must be surrendered to me.\u201d\n\u201cThen my answer is still no, my lord.\u201d\nThe king clenched his jaw. He said nothing.\nMelisandre spoke instead. \u201cMay the Lord of Light protect you in your darkness, Ser Cortnay.\u201d\n\u201cMay the Others bugger your Lord of Light,\u201d Penrose spat back, \u201cand wipe his arse with that rag you bear.\u201d\nLord Alester Florent cleared his throat. \u201cSer Cortnay, mind your tongue. His Grace means the boy no harm. The child is his own blood, and mine as well. My niece Delena was the mother, as all men know. If you will not trust to the king, trust to me. You know me for a man of honor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you for a man of ambition,\u201d Ser Cortnay broke in. \u201cA man who changes kings and gods the way I change my boots. As do these other turncloaks I see before me.\u201d\nAn angry clamor went up from the king\u2019s men. He is not far wrong, Davos thought. Only a short time before, the Fossoways, Guyard Morrigen, and the Lords Caron, Varner, Errol, and Estermont had all belonged to Renly. They had sat in his pavilion, helped him make his battle plans, plotted how Stannis might be brought low. And Lord Florent had been with them\u2014he might be Queen Selyse\u2019s own uncle, but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater from bending his knee to Renly when Renly\u2019s star was rising.\nBryce Caron walked his horse forward a few paces, his long rainbow-striped cloak twisting in the wind off the bay. \u201cNo man here is a turncloak, ser. My fealty belongs to Storm\u2019s End, and King Stannis is its rightful lord\u2026 and our true king. He is the last of House Baratheon, Robert\u2019s heir and Renly\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cIf that is so, why is the Knight of Flowers not among you? And where is Mathis Rowan? Randyll Tarly? Lady Oakheart? Why are they not here in your company, they who loved Renly best? Where is Brienne of Tarth, I ask you?\u201d\n\u201cThat one?\u201d Ser Guyard Morrigen laughed harshly. \u201cShe ran. As well she might. Hers was the hand that slew the king.\u201d\n\u201cA lie,\u201d Ser Cortnay said. \u201cI knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at her father\u2019s feet in Evenfall Hall, and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to Storm\u2019s End. She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him, a blind man could see it.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d declared Lord Florent airily, \u201cand she would scarcely be the first maid maddened to murder by a man who spurned her. Though for my own part, I believe it was Lady Stark who slew the king. She had journeyed all the way from Riverrun to plead for an alliance, and Renly had refused her. No doubt she saw him as a danger to her son, and so removed him.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Brienne,\u201d insisted Lord Caron. \u201cSer Emmon Cuy swore as much before he died. You have my oath on that, Ser Cortnay.\u201d\nContempt thickened Ser Cortnay\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd what is that worth? You wear your cloak of many colors, I see. The one Renly gave you when you swore your oath to protect him. If he is dead, how is it you are not?\u201d He turned his scorn on Guyard Morrigen. \u201cI might ask the same of you, ser. Guyard the Green, yes? Of the Rainbow Guard? Sworn to give his own life for his king\u2019s? if I had such a cloak, I would be ashamed to wear it.\u201d\nMorrigen bristled. \u201cBe glad this is a parley, Penrose, or I would have your tongue for those words.\u201d\n\u201cAnd cast it in the same fire where you left your manhood?\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Stannis said. \u201cThe Lord of Light willed that my brother die for his treason. Who did the deed matters not.\u201d\n\u201cNot to you, perhaps,\u201d said Ser Cortnay. \u201cI have heard your proposal, Lord Stannis. Now here is mine.\u201d He pulled off his glove and flung it full in the king\u2019s face. \u201cSingle combat. Sword, lance, or any weapon you care to name. Or if you fear to hazard your magic sword and royal skin against an old man, name you a champion, and I shall do the same.\u201d He gave Guyard Morrigen and Bryce Caron a scathing look. \u201cEither of these pups would do nicely, I should think.\u201d\nSer Guyard Morrigen grew dark with fury. \u201cI will take up the gage, if it please the king.\u201d\n\u201cAs would I.\u201d Bryce Caron looked to Stannis.\nThe king ground his teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d\nSer Cortnay did not seem surprised. \u201cIs it the justice of your cause you doubt, my lord, or the strength of your arm? Are you afraid I\u2019ll piss on your burning sword and put it out?\u201d\n\u201cDo you take me for an utter fool, ser?\u201d asked Stannis. \u201cI have twenty thousand men. You are besieged by land and sea. Why would I choose single combat when my eventual victory is certain?\u201d The king pointed a finger at him. \u201cI give you fair warning. If you force me to take my castle by storm, you may expect no mercy. I will hang you for traitors, every one of you.\u201d\n\u201cAs the gods will it. Bring on your storm, my lord\u2014and recall, if you do, the name of this castle.\u201d Ser Cortnay gave a pull on his reins and rode back toward the gate.\nStannis said no word, but turned his horse around and started back toward his camp. The others followed. \u201cIf we storm these walls thousands will die,\u201d fretted ancient Lord Estermont, who was the king\u2019s grandfather on his mother\u2019s side. \u201cBetter to hazard but a single life, surely? Our cause is righteous, so the gods must surely bless our champion\u2019s arms with victory.\u201d\nGod, old man, thought Davos. You forget, we have only one now, Melisandre\u2019s Lord of Light.\nSer Jon Fossoway said, \u201cI would gladly take this challenge myself, though I\u2019m not half the swordsman Lord Caron is, or Ser Guyard. Renly left no notable knights at Storm\u2019s End. Garrison duty is for old men and green boys.\u201d\nLord Caron agreed. \u201cAn easy victory, to be sure. And what glory, to win Storm\u2019s End with a single stroke!\u201d\nStannis raked them all with a look. \u201cYou chatter like magpies, and with less sense. I will have quiet.\u201d The king\u2019s eyes fell on Davos. \u201cSer. Ride with me.\u201d He spurred his horse away from his followers. Only Melisandre kept pace, bearing the great standard of the fiery heart with the crowned stag within. As if it had been swallowed whole.\nDavos saw the looks that passed between the lordlings as he rode past them to join the king. These were no onion knights, but proud men from houses whose names were old in honor. Somehow he knew that Renly had never chided them in such a fashion. The youngest of the Baratheons had been born with a gift for easy courtesy that his brother sadly lacked.\nHe eased back to a slow trot when his horse came up beside the king\u2019s. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d Seen at close hand, Stannis looked worse than Davos had realized from afar. His face had grown haggard, and he had dark circles under his eyes.\n\u201cA smuggler must be a fair judge of men,\u201d the king said. \u201cWhat do you make of this Ser Cortnay Penrose?\u201d\n\u201cA stubborn man,\u201d said Davos carefully.\n\u201cHungry for death, I call it. He throws my pardon in my face. Aye, and throws his life away in the bargain, and the lives of every man inside those walls. Single combat?\u201d The king snorted in derision. \u201cNo doubt he mistook me for Robert.\u201d\n\u201cMore like he was desperate. What other hope does he have?\u201d\n\u201cNone. The castle will fall. But how to do it quickly?\u201d Stannis brooded on that for a moment. Under the steady clop-clop of hooves, Davos could hear the faint sound of the king grinding his teeth. \u201cLord Alester urges me to bring old Lord Penrose here. Ser Cortnay\u2019s father. You know the man, I believe?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I came as your envoy, Lord Penrose received me more courteously than most,\u201d Davos said. \u201cHe is an old done man, sire. Sickly and failing.\u201d\n\u201cFlorent would have him fail more visibly. In his son\u2019s sight, with a noose about his neck.\u201d\nIt was dangerous to oppose the queen\u2019s men, but Davos had vowed always to tell his king the truth. \u201cI think that would be ill done, my liege. Ser Cortnay will watch his father die before he would ever betray his trust. It would gain us nothing, and bring dishonor to our cause.\u201d\n\u201cWhat dishonor?\u201d Stannis bristled. \u201cWould you have me spare the lives of traitors?\u201d\n\u201cYou have spared the lives of those behind us.\u201d\n\u201cDo you scold me for that, smuggler?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not my place.\u201d Davos feared he had said too much.\nThe king was relentless. \u201cYou esteem this Penrose more than you do my lords bannermen. Why?\u201d\n\u201cHe keeps faith.\u201d\n\u201cA misplaced faith in a dead usurper.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Davos admitted, \u201cbut still, he keeps faith.\u201d\n\u201cAs those behind us do not?\u201d\nDavos had come too far with Stannis to play coy now. \u201cLast year they were Robert\u2019s men. A moon ago they were Renly\u2019s. This morning they are yours. Whose will they be on the morrow?\u201d\nAnd Stannis laughed. A sudden gust, rough and full of scorn. \u201cI told you, Melisandre,\u201d he said to the red woman, \u201cmy Onion Knight tells me the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI see you know him well, Your Grace,\u201d the red woman said.\n\u201cDavos, I have missed you sorely,\u201d the king said. \u201cAye, I have a tail of traitors, your nose does not deceive you. My lords bannermen are inconstant even in their treasons. I need them, but you should know how it sickens me to pardon such as these when I have punished better men for lesser crimes. You have every right to reproach me, Ser Davos.\u201d\n\u201cYou reproach yourself more than I ever could, Your Grace. You must have these great lords to win your throne\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFingers and all, it seems.\u201d Stannis smiled grimly.\nUnthinking, Davos raised his maimed hand to the pouch at his throat, and felt the fingerbones within. Luck.\nThe king saw the motion. \u201cAre they still there, Onion Knight? You have not lost them?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you keep them? I have often wondered.\u201d\n\u201cThey remind me of what I was. Where I came from. They remind me of your justice, my liege.\u201d\n\u201cIt was justice,\u201d Stannis said. \u201cA good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. You were a hero and a smuggler.\u201d He glanced behind at Lord Florent and the others, rainbow knights and turncloaks, who were following at a distance. \u201cThese pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brother\u2019s banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. Pardoned them, yes. Forgiven. But not forgotten.\u201d He fell silent for a moment, brooding on his plans for justice. And then, abruptly, he said, \u201cWhat do the smallfolk say of Renly\u2019s death?\u201d\n\u201cThey grieve. Your brother was well loved.\u201d\n\u201cFools love a fool,\u201d grumbled Stannis, \u201cbut I grieve for him as well. For the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.\u201d He was silent for a time, and then he said, \u201cHow did the commons take the news of Cersei\u2019s incest?\u201d\n\u201cWhile we were among them they shouted for King Stannis. I cannot speak for what they said once we had sailed.\u201d\n\u201cSo you do not think they believed?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was smuggling, I learned that some men believe everything and some nothing. We met both sorts. And there is another tale being spread as well\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Stannis bit off the word. \u201cSelyse has given me horns, and tied a fool\u2019s bells to the end of each. My daughter fathered by a halfwit jester! A tale as vile as it is absurd. Renly threw it in my teeth when we met to parley. You would need to be as mad as Patchface to believe such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so, my liege\u2026 but whether they believe the story or no, they delight to tell it.\u201d In many places it had come before them, poisoning the well for their own true tale.\n\u201cRobert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer them pure cold water and they squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes.\u201d Stannis ground his teeth. \u201cIf someone said I had magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert, likely they would believe that as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot stop them talking, my liege,\u201d Davos said, \u201cbut when you take your vengeance on your brothers\u2019 true killers, the realm will know such tales for lies.\u201d\nStannis only seemed to half hear him. \u201cI have no doubt that Cersei had a hand in Robert\u2019s death. I will have justice for him. Aye, and for Ned Stark and Jon Arryn as well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for Renly?\u201d The words were out before Davos could stop to consider them.\nFor a long time the king did not speak. Then, very softly, he said, \u201cI dream of it sometimes. Of Renly\u2019s dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood.\u201d Stannis looked down at his hands. \u201cI was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried to wake me. Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting, fretting. I should have been ahorse, armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean.\u201d\nSer Davos Seaworth could feel his phantom fingertips start to itch. Something is wrong here, the onetime smuggler thought. Yet he nodded and said, \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cRenly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?\u201d The king gave a shake of his head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. \u201cOnly Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother\u2019s peach.\u201d\nBy then they were in amongst the camp, riding past the ordered rows of tents, the blowing banners, and the stacks of shields and spears. The stink of horse dung was heavy in the air, mingled with the woodsmoke and the smell of cooking meat. Stannis reined up long enough to bark a brusque dismissal to Lord Florent and the others, commanding them to attend him in his pavilion one hour hence for a council of war. They bowed their heads and dispersed, while Davos and Melisandre rode to the king\u2019s pavilion.\nThe tent had to be large, since it was there his lords bannermen came to council. Yet there was nothing grand about it. It was a soldier\u2019s tent of heavy canvas, dyed the dark yellow that sometimes passed for gold. Only the royal banner that streamed atop the center pole marked it as a king\u2019s. That, and the guards without; queen\u2019s men leaning on tall spears, with the badge of the fiery heart sewn over their own.\nGrooms came up to help them dismount. One of the guards relieved Melisandre of her cumbersome standard, driving the staff deep into the soft ground. Devan stood to one side of the door, waiting to lift the flap for the king. An older squire waited beside him. Stannis took off his crown and handed it to Devan. \u201cCold water, cups for two. Davos, attend me. My lady, I shall send for you when I require you.\u201d\n\u201cAs the king commands.\u201d Melisandre bowed.\nAfter the brightness of the morning, the interior of the pavilion seemed cool and dim. Stannis seated himself on a plain wooden camp stool and waved Davos to another. \u201cOne day I may make you a lord, smuggler. If only to irk Celtigar and Florent. You will not thank me, though. It will mean you must suffer through these councils, and feign interest in the braying of mules.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you have them, if they serve no purpose?\u201d\n\u201cThe mules love the sound of their own braying, why else? And I need them to haul my cart. Oh, to be sure, once in a great while some useful notion is put forth. But not today, I think\u2014ah, here\u2019s your son with our water.\u201d\nDevan set the tray on the table and filled two clay cups. The king sprinkled a pinch of salt in his cup before he drank; Davos took his water straight, wishing it were wine. \u201cYou were speaking of your council?\u201d\n\u201cLet me tell you how it will go. Lord Velaryon will urge me to storm the castle walls at first light, grapnels and scaling ladders against arrows and boiling oil. The young mules will think this a splendid notion. Estermont will favor settling down to starve them out, as Tyrell and Redwyne once tried with me. That might take a year, but old mules are patient. And Lord Caron and the others who like to kick will want to take up Ser Cortnay\u2019s gauntlet and hazard all upon a single combat. Each one imagining he will be my champion and win undying fame.\u201d The king finished his water. \u201cWhat would you have me do, smuggler?\u201d\nDavos considered a moment before he answered. \u201cStrike for King\u2019s Landing at once.\u201d\nThe king snorted. \u201cAnd leave Storm\u2019s End untaken?\u201d\n\u201cSer Cortnay does not have the power to harm you. The Lannisters do. A siege would take too long, single combat is too chancy, and an assault would cost thousands of lives with no certainty of success. And there is no need. Once you dethrone Joffrey this castle must come to you with all the rest. It is said about the camp that Lord Tywin Lannister rushes west to rescue Lannisport from the vengeance of the northmen\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou have a passing clever father, Devan,\u201d the king told the boy standing by his elbow. \u201cHe makes me wish I had more smugglers in my service. And fewer lords. Though you are wrong in one respect, Davos. There is a need. If I leave Storm\u2019s End untaken in my rear, it will be said I was defeated here. And that I cannot permit. Men do not love me as they loved my brothers. They follow me because they fear me\u2026 and defeat is death to fear. The castle must fall.\u201d His jaw ground side to side. \u201cAye, and quickly. Doran Martell has called his banners and fortified the mountain passes. His Dornishmen are poised to sweep down onto the Marches. And Highgarden is far from spent. My brother left the greater part of his power at Bitterbridge, near sixty thousand foot. I sent my wife\u2019s brother Ser Errol with Ser Parmen Crane to take them under my command, but they have not returned. I fear that Ser Loras Tyrell reached Bitterbridge before my envoys, and took that host for his own.\u201d\n\u201cAll the more reason to take King\u2019s Landing as soon as we may. Salladhor Saan told me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSalladhor Saan thinks only of gold!\u201d Stannis exploded. \u201cHis head is full of dreams of the treasure he fancies lies under the Red Keep, so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan. The day I need military counsel from a Lysene brigand is the day I put off my crown and take the black.\u201d The king made a fist. \u201cAre you here to serve me, smuggler? Or to vex me with arguments?\u201d\n\u201cI am yours,\u201d Davos said.\n\u201cThen hear me. Ser Cortnay\u2019s lieutenant is cousin to the Fossoways. Lord Meadows, a green boy of twenty. Should some ill chance strike down Penrose, command of Storm\u2019s End would pass to this stripling, and his cousins believe he would accept my terms and yield up the castle.\u201d\n\u201cI remember another stripling who was given command of Storm\u2019s End. He could not have been much more than twenty.\u201d\n\u201cLord Meadows is not as stonehead stubborn as I was.\u201d\n\u201cStubborn or craven, what does it matter? Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to me.\u201d\n\u201cSo did my brother, the day before his death. The night is dark and full of terrors, Davos.\u201d\nDavos Seaworth felt the small hairs rising on the back of his neck. \u201cMy lord, I do not understand you.\u201d\n\u201cI do not require your understanding. Only your service. Ser Cortnay will be dead within the day. Melisandre has seen it in the flames of the future. His death and the manner of it. He will not die in knightly combat, needless to say.\u201d Stannis held out his cup, and Devan filled it again from the flagon. \u201cHer flames do not lie. She saw Renly\u2019s doom as well. On Dragonstone she saw it, and told Selyse. Lord Velaryon and your friend Salladhor Saan would have had me sail against Joffrey, but Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm\u2019s End, I would win the best part of my brother\u2019s power, and she was right.\u201d\n\u201cB-but,\u201d Davos stammered, \u201cLord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to the castle. He was marching toward King\u2019s Landing before, against the Lannisters, he would have\u2014\u201d\nStannis shifted in his seat, frowning. \u201cWas, would have, what is that? He did what he did. He came here with his banners and his peaches, to his doom\u2026 and it was well for me he did. Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well. A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King\u2019s Landing. Had I met my brother there, it might have been me who died in place of him.\u201d\n\u201cOr you might have joined your strength to his to bring down the Lannisters,\u201d Davos protested. \u201cWhy not that? If she saw two futures, well\u2026 both cannot be true.\u201d\nKing Stannis pointed a finger. \u201cThere you err, Onion Knight. Some lights cast more than one shadow. Stand before the nightfire and you\u2019ll see for yourself. The flames shift and dance, never still. The shadows grow tall and short, and every man casts a dozen. Some are fainter than others, that\u2019s all. Well, men cast their shadows across the future as well. One shadow or many. Melisandre sees them all.\n\u201cYou do not love the woman. I know that, Davos, I am not blind. My lords mislike her too. Estermont thinks the flaming heart ill-chosen and begs to fight beneath the crowned stag as of old. Ser Guyard says a woman should not be my standard-bearer. Others whisper that she has no place in my war councils, that I ought to send her back to Asshai, that it is sinful to keep her in my tent of a night. Aye, they whisper\u2026 while she serves.\u201d\n\u201cServes how?\u201d Davos asked, dreading the answer.\n\u201cAs needed.\u201d The king looked at him. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Davos licked his lips. \u201cI am yours to command. What would you have me do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing you have not done before. Only land a boat beneath the castle, unseen, in the black of night. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Tonight?\u201d\nThe king gave a curt nod. \u201cYou will need a small boat. Not Black Betha. No one must know what you do.\u201d\nDavos wanted to protest. He was a knight now, no longer a smuggler, and he had never been an assassin. Yet when he opened his mouth, the words would not come. This was Stannis, his just lord, to whom he owed all he was. And he had his sons to consider as well. Gods be good, what has she done to him?\n\u201cYou are quiet,\u201d Stannis observed.\nAnd should remain so, Davos told himself, yet instead he said, \u201cMy liege, you must have the castle, I see that now, but surely there are other ways. Cleaner ways. Let Ser Cortnay keep the bastard boy and he may well yield.\u201d\n\u201cI must have the boy, Davos. Must. Melisandre has seen that in the flames as well.\u201d\nDavos groped for some other answer. \u201cStorm\u2019s End holds no knight who can match Ser Guyard or Lord Caron, or any of a hundred others sworn to your service. This single combat\u2026 could it be that Ser Cortnay seeks for a way to yield with honor? Even if it means his own life?\u201d\nA troubled look crossed the king\u2019s face like a passing cloud. \u201cMore like he plans some treachery. There will be no combat of champions. Ser Cortnay was dead before he ever threw that glove. The flames do not lie, Davos.\u201d\nYet they require me to make them true, he thought. It had been a long time since Davos Seaworth felt so sad.\nAnd so it was that he found himself once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of night, steering a tiny boat with a black sail. The sky was the same, and the sea. The same salt smell was in the air, and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered it. A thousand flickering campfires burned around the castle, as the fires of the Tyrells and Redwynes had sixteen years before. But all the rest was different.\nThe last time it was life I brought to Storm\u2019s End, shaped to look like onions. This time it is death, in the shape of Melisandre of Asshai. Sixteen years ago, the sails had cracked and snapped with every shift of wind, until he\u2019d pulled them down and gone on with muffled oars. Even so, his heart had been in his gullet. The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax after so long, however, and they had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin. This time, the only ships in sight belonged to Stannis, and the only danger would come from watchers on the castle walls. Even so, Davos was taut as a bowstring.\nMelisandre huddled upon a thwart, lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered her from head to heels, her face a paleness beneath the cowl. Davos loved the water. He slept best when he had a deck rocking beneath him, and the sighing of the wind in his rigging was a sweeter sound to him than any a singer could make with his harp strings. Even the sea brought him no comfort tonight, though. \u201cI can smell the fear on you, ser knight,\u201d the red woman said softly.\n\u201cSomeone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors. And tonight I am no knight. Tonight I am Davos the smuggler again. Would that you were an onion.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cIs it me you fear? Or what we do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you do. I\u2019ll have no part of it.\u201d\n\u201cYour hand raised the sail. Your hand holds the tiller.\u201d\nSilent, Davos tended to his course. The shore was a snarl of rocks, so he was taking them well out across the bay. He would wait for the tide to turn before coming about. Storm\u2019s End dwindled behind them, but the red woman seemed unconcerned. \u201cAre you a good man, Davos Seaworth?\u201d she asked.\nWould a good man be doing this? \u201cI am a man,\u201d he said. \u201cI am kind to my wife, but I have known other women. I have tried to be a father to my sons, to help make them a place in this world. Aye, I\u2019ve broken laws, but I never felt evil until tonight. I would say my parts are mixed, m\u2019lady. Good and bad.\u201d\n\u201cA grey man,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither white nor black, but partaking of both. Is that what you are, Ser Davos?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I am? It seems to me that most men are grey.\u201d\n\u201cIf half of an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion. A man is good, or he is evil.\u201d\nThe fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky, and the land was almost out of sight. It was time to come about. \u201cWatch your head, my lady.\u201d He pushed on the tiller, and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned. Melisandre leaned under the swinging yard, one hand on the gunwale, calm as ever. Wood creaked, canvas cracked, and water splashed, so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear. Davos knew better. The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm\u2019s End, and that but faintly.\nA rippling wake spread out behind as they swung back toward the shore. \u201cYou speak of men and onions,\u201d Davos said to Melisandre. \u201cWhat of women? Is it not the same for them? Are you good or evil, my lady?\u201d\nThat made her chuckle. \u201cOh, good. I am a knight of sorts myself, sweet ser. A champion of light and life.\u201d\n\u201cYet you mean to kill a man tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you killed Maester Cressen.\u201d\n\u201cYour maester poisoned himself. He meant to poison me, but I was protected by a greater power and he was not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Renly Baratheon? Who was it who killed him?\u201d\nHer head turned. Beneath the shadow of the cowl, her eyes burned like pale red candle flames. \u201cNot I.\u201d\n\u201cLiar.\u201d Davos was certain now.\nMelisandre laughed again. \u201cYou are lost in darkness and confusion, Ser Davos.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a good thing.\u201d Davos gestured at the distant lights flickering along the walls of Storm\u2019s End. \u201cFeel how cold the wind is? The guards will huddle close to those torches. A little warmth, a little light, they\u2019re a comfort on a night like this. Yet that will blind them, so they will not see us pass.\u201d I hope. \u201cThe god of darkness protects us now, my lady. Even you.\u201d\nThe flames of her eyes seemed to burn a little brighter at that. \u201cSpeak not that name, ser. Lest you draw his black eye upon us. He protects no man, I promise you. He is the enemy of all that lives. It is the torches that hide us, you have said so yourself. Fire. The bright gift of the Lord of Light.\u201d\n\u201cHave it your way.\u201d\n\u201cHis way, rather.\u201d\nThe wind was shifting, Davos could feel it, see it in the way the black canvas rippled. He reached for the halyards. \u201cHelp me bring in the sail. I\u2019ll row us the rest of the way.\u201d\nTogether they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath them. As Davos unshipped the oars and slid them into the choppy black water, he said, \u201cWho rowed you to Renly?\u201d\n\u201cThere was no need,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was unprotected. But here\u2026 this Storm\u2019s End is an old place. There are spells woven into the stones. Dark walls that no shadow can pass\u2014ancient, forgotten, yet still in place.\u201d\n\u201cShadow?\u201d Davos felt his flesh prickling. \u201cA shadow is a thing of darkness.\u201d\n\u201cYou are more ignorant than a child, ser knight. There are no shadows in the dark. Shadows are the servants of light, the children of fire. The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows.\u201d\nFrowning, Davos hushed her then. They were coming close to shore once more, and voices carried across the water. He rowed, the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the waves. The seaward side of Storm\u2019s End perched upon a pale white cliff, the chalky stone sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall. A mouth yawned in the cliff, and it was that Davos steered for, as he had sixteen years before. The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle, where the storm lords of old had built their landing.\nThe passage was navigable only during high tide, and was never less than treacherous, but his smuggler\u2019s skills had not deserted him. Davos threaded their way deftly between the jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before them. He let the waves carry them inside. They crashed around him, slamming the boat this way and that and soaking them to the skin. A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom, snarling foam, and Davos barely kept them off it with an oar.\nThen they were past, engulfed in darkness, and the waters smoothed.\nThe little boat slowed and swirled. The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to surround them. Davos had not expected the blackness. The last time, torches had burned all along the tunnel, and the eyes of starving men had peered down through the murder holes in the ceiling. The portcullis was somewhere ahead, he knew. Davos used the oars to slow them, and they drifted against it almost gently.\n\u201cThis is as far as we go, unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us.\u201d His whispers scurried across the lapping water like a line of mice on soft pink feet.\n\u201cHave we passed within the walls?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Beneath. But we can go no farther. The portcullis goes all the way to the bottom. And the bars are too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through.\u201d\nThere was no answer but a soft rustling. And then a light bloomed amidst the darkness.\nDavos raised a hand to shield his eyes, and his breath caught in his throat. Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe. Beneath, she was naked, and huge with child. Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest, and her belly bulged as if near to bursting. \u201cGods preserve us,\u201d he whispered, and heard her answering laugh, deep and throaty. Her eyes were hot coals, and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own. Melisandre shone.\nPanting, she squatted and spread her legs. Blood ran down her thighs, black as ink. Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both. And Davos saw the crown of the child\u2019s head push its way out of her. Two arms wriggled free, grasping, black fingers coiling around Melisandre\u2019s straining thighs, pushing, until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos, tall as the tunnel, towering above the boat. He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone, twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water, but that instant was long enough.\nHe knew that shadow. As he knew the man who\u2019d cast it.",

      "content": "Jon\nThe call came drifting through the black of night. Jon pushed himself onto an elbow, his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir. The horn that wakes the sleepers, he thought.\nThe long low note lingered at the edge of hearing. The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west. As the sound of the horn faded, even the wind ceased to blow. Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening. A horse whickered and was hushed. For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath. The brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch waited for a second blast, praying they should not hear it, fearing that they would.\nWhen the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again, they grinned at one another sheepishly, as if to deny that they had been anxious. Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire, buckled on his swordbelt, pulled on his boots, shook the dirt and dew from the cloak, and fastened it around his shoulders. The flames blazed up beside him, welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed. He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent. After a moment Mormont lifted the flap. \u201cOne blast?\u201d On his shoulder, his raven sat fluffed and silent, looking miserable.\n\u201cOne, my lord,\u201d Jon agreed. \u201cBrothers returning.\u201d\nMormont moved to the fire. \u201cThe Halfhand. And past time.\u201d He had grown more restive every day they waited; much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs. \u201cSee that there\u2019s hot food for the men and fodder for the horses. I\u2019ll see Qhorin at once.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring him, my lord.\u201d The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago. When they had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder. Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire, and not just from Dolorous Edd. Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible. Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin\u2019s trail and learn what had befallen him. And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains. \u201cMance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch,\u201d Thoren had declared, \u201cbut he will never look for us so far north. If we ride up the Milkwater, we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him.\u201d\n\u201cThe numbers would be greatly against us,\u201d Ser Ottyn had objected. \u201cCraster said he was gathering a great host. Many thousands. Without Qhorin, we are only two hundred.\u201d\n\u201cSend two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens,\u201d said Smallwood confidently.\n\u201cThere are goats among these sheep, Thoren,\u201d warned Jarman Buckwell. \u201cAye, and maybe a few lions. Rattleshirt, Harma the Dogshead, Alfyn Crowkiller\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know them as well as you do, Buckwell,\u201d Thoren Smallwood snapped back. \u201cAnd I mean to have their heads, every one. These are wildlings. No soldiers. A few hundred heroes, drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls. We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels.\u201d\nThey had argued for many hours, and reached no agreement. The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat, but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle. In the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower, and talk again if they did not appear.\nAnd now they had, which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer. Jon was glad of that much, at least. If they must battle Mance Rayder, let it be soon.\nHe found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods. Jon gave him something new to complain about. Together they woke Hake, who received the Lord Commander\u2019s orders with a stream of curses, but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a soup.\nSam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp. Under the black hood his face was as pale and round as the moon. \u201cI heard the horn. Has your uncle come back?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the men from the Shadow Tower.\u201d It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark\u2019s safe return. The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why they would have buried it there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say. \u201cSam, I have to go.\u201d\nAt the ringwall, he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening. It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope. All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made them look as shaggy as their garrons. Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse. When he looked more closely, it was plain that many of them were wounded. There has been trouble on the way.\nJon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him, though they had never met. The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch; a man of slow words and swift action, tall and straight as a spear, long-limbed and solemn. Unlike his men, he was clean-shaven. His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys. Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling\u2019s axe that would otherwise have split his skull. It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes, and slew him while he was blind. Since that day, the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable.\nJon hailed him. \u201cLord Commander Mormont would see you at once. I\u2019ll show you to his tent.\u201d\nQhorin swung down from his saddle. \u201cMy men are hungry, and our horses require tending.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be seen to.\u201d\nThe ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed. \u201cYou are Jon Snow. You have your father\u2019s look.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know him, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cI am no lordling. Only a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. I knew Lord Eddard, yes. And his father before him.\u201d\nJon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin\u2019s long strides. \u201cLord Rickard died before I was born.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a friend to the Watch.\u201d Qhorin glanced behind. \u201cIt is said that a direwolf runs with you.\u201d\n\u201cGhost should be back by dawn. He hunts at night.\u201d\nThey found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle over the Old Bear\u2019s cookfire. Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair. \u201cI had begun to fear for you. Did you meet with trouble?\u201d\n\u201cWe met with Alfyn Crowkiller. Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall, and we chanced on him returning.\u201d Qhorin removed his helm. \u201cAlfyn will trouble the realm no longer, but some of his company escaped us. We hunted down as many as we could, but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the cost?\u201d\n\u201cFour brothers dead. A dozen wounded. A third as many as the foe. And we took captives. One died quickly from his wounds, but the other lived long enough to be questioned.\u201d\n\u201cBest talk of this inside. Jon will fetch you a horn of ale. Or would you prefer hot spiced wine?\u201d\n\u201cBoiled water will suffice. An egg and a bite of bacon.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through.\nEdd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon. \u201cI envy those eggs,\u201d he said. \u201cI could do with a bit of boiling about now. If the kettle were larger, I might jump in. Though I would sooner it were wine than water. There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk. I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once. It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve it.\u201d\n\u201cYou drank the wine?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awful thing to find a brother dead. You\u2019d have need of a drink as well, Lord Snow.\u201d Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg.\nRestless, Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick. He could hear the Old Bear\u2019s voice inside the tent, punctuated by the raven\u2019s squawks and Qhorin Halfhand\u2019s quieter tones, but he could not make out the words. Alfyn Crowkiller dead, that\u2019s good. He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders, taking his name from the black brothers he\u2019d slain. So why does Qhorin sound so grave, after such a victory?\nJon had hoped that the arrival of men from the Shadow Tower would lift the spirits in the camp. Only last night, he was coming back through the dark from a piss when he heard five or six men talking in low voices around the embers of a fire. When he heard Chett muttering that it was past time they turned back, Jon stopped to listen. \u201cIt\u2019s an old man\u2019s folly, this ranging,\u201d he heard. \u201cWe\u2019ll find nothing but our graves in them mountains.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s giants in the Frostfangs, and wargs, and worse things,\u201d said Lark the Sisterman.\n\u201cI\u2019ll not be going there, I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Old Bear\u2019s not like to give you a choice.\u201d\n\u201cMight be we won\u2019t give him one,\u201d said Chett.\nJust then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled, and he had to move away quickly, before he was seen. I was not meant to hear that, he thought. He considered taking the tale to Mormont, but he could not bring himself to inform on his brothers, even brothers such as Chett and the Sisterman. It was just empty talk, he told himself. They are cold and afraid, we all are. It was hard waiting here, perched on the stony summit above the forest, wondering what the morrow might bring. The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome.\nJon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass. He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip. Ugly, but it served. Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight\u2019s breastplate, but Jon was not so certain. The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel, albeit far more brittle.\nIt must have been buried for a reason.\nHe had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander. The warhorn he had given to Sam. On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it. The rim was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things. \u201cMake a drinking horn out of it,\u201d Jon told him, \u201cand every time you take a drink you\u2019ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men.\u201d He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck.\nThe Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger, but he preferred a steel knife at his belt, Jon had noticed. Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or what it might mean. Perhaps Qhorin will know. The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the wild than any other living man.\n\u201cYou want to serve, or shall I?\u201d\nJon sheathed the dagger. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d He wanted to hear what they were saying.\nEdd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread, stacked them on a wooden platter, covered them with bacon and bacon drippings, and filled a bowl with hard-cooked eggs. Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord Commander\u2019s tent.\nQhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor, his spine as straight as a spear. Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke. \u201c\u2026Rattleshirt, the Weeping Man, and every other chief great and small,\u201d he was saying. \u201cThey have wargs as well, and mammoths, and more strength than we would have dreamed. Or so he claimed. I will not swear as to the truth of it. Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer.\u201d\n\u201cTrue or false, the Wall must be warned,\u201d the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter between them. \u201cAnd the king.\u201d\n\u201cWhich king?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them. The true and the false alike. If they would claim the realm, let them defend it.\u201d\nThe Halfhand helped himself to an egg and cracked it on the edge of the bowl. \u201cThese kings will do what they will,\u201d he said, peeling away the shell. \u201cLikely it will be little enough. The best hope is Winterfell. The Starks must rally the north.\u201d\n\u201cYes. To be sure.\u201d The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at it, tossed it aside, opened another. He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see it. The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but they had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled. Only three were now garrisoned, a fact that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did. \u201cSer Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from King\u2019s Landing, we can hope. If we man Greyguard from the Shadow Tower and the Long Barrow from Eastwatch\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGreyguard has largely collapsed. Stonedoor would serve better, if the men could be found. Icemark and Deep Lake as well, mayhaps. With daily patrols along the battlements between.\u201d\n\u201cPatrols, aye. Twice a day, if we can. The Wall itself is a formidable obstacle. Undefended, it cannot stop them, yet it will delay them. The larger the host, the longer they\u2019ll require. From the emptiness they\u2019ve left behind, they must mean to bring their women with them. Their young as well, and beasts\u2026 have you ever seen a goat climb a ladder? A rope? They will need to build a stair, or a great ramp\u2026 it will take a moon\u2019s turn at the least, perhaps longer. Mance will know his best chance is to pass beneath the Wall. Through a gate, or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA breach.\u201d\nMormont\u2019s head came up sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath it, my lord. They plan to break it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wall is seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that it would take a hundred men a year to cut through it with picks and axes.\u201d\n\u201cEven so.\u201d\nMormont plucked at his beard, frowning. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cHow else? Sorcery.\u201d Qhorin bit the egg in half. \u201cWhy else would Mance choose to gather his strength in the Frostfangs? Bleak and hard they are, and a long weary march from the Wall.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Qhorin, finishing the egg, \u201cbut there is more, I think. He is seeking something in the high cold places. He is searching for something he needs.\u201d\n\u201cSomething?\u201d Mormont\u2019s raven lifted its head and screamed. The sound was sharp as a knife in the closeness of the tent.\n\u201cSome power. What it is, our captive could not say. He was questioned perhaps too sharply, and died with much unsaid. I doubt he knew in any case.\u201d\nJon could hear the wind outside. It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes. Mormont rubbed his mouth thoughtfully. \u201cSome power,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI must know.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must send scouts into the mountains.\u201d\n\u201cI am loath to risk more men.\u201d\n\u201cWe can only die. Why else do we don these black cloaks, but to die in defense of the realm? I would send fifteen men, in three parties of five. One to probe the Milkwater, one the Skirling Pass, one to climb the Giant\u2019s Stair. Jarman Buckwell, Thoren Smallwood, and myself to command. To learn what waits in those mountains.\u201d\n\u201cWaits,\u201d the raven cried. \u201cWaits.\u201d\nLord Commander Mormont sighed deep in his chest. \u201cI see no other choice,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut if you do not return\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomeone will come down out of the Frostfangs, my lord,\u201d the ranger said. \u201cIf us, all well and good. If not, it will be Mance Rayder, and you sit square in his path. He cannot march south and leave you behind, to follow and harry his rear. He must attack. This is a strong place.\u201d\n\u201cNot that strong,\u201d said Mormont.\n\u201cBelike we shall all die, then. Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall. Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to their aid, time to hone their axes and repair their catapults. Our lives will be coin well spent.\u201d\n\u201cDie,\u201d the raven muttered, pacing along Mormont\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDie, die, die, die.\u201d The old Bear sat slumped and silent, as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for him to bear. But at last he said, \u201cMay the gods forgive me. Choose your men.\u201d\nQhorin Halfhand turned his head. His eyes met Jon\u2019s, and held them for a long moment. \u201cVery well. I choose Jon Snow.\u201d\nMormont blinked. \u201cHe is hardly more than a boy. And my steward besides. Not even a ranger.\u201d\n\u201cTollett can care for you as well, my lord.\u201d Qhorin lifted his maimed, two-fingered hand. \u201cThe old gods are still strong beyond the Wall. The gods of the First Men\u2026 and the Starks.\u201d\nMormont looked at Jon. \u201cWhat is your will in this?\u201d\n\u201cTo go,\u201d he said at once.\nThe old man smiled sadly. \u201cI thought it might be.\u201d\nDawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand. The wind swirled around them, stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire.\n\u201cWe ride at noon,\u201d the ranger told him. \u201cBest find that wolf of yours.\u201d",

      "content": "Tyrion\n\u201cThe queen intends to send Prince Tommen away.\u201d They knelt alone in the hushed dimness of the sept, surrounded by shadows and flickering candles, but even so Lancel kept his voice low. \u201cLord Gyles will take him to Rosby, and conceal him there in the guise of a page. They plan to darken his hair and tell everyone that he is the son of a hedge knight.\u201d\n\u201cIs it the mob she fears? Or me?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d said Lancel.\n\u201cAh.\u201d Tyrion had known nothing of this ploy. Had Varys\u2019s little birds failed him for once? Even spiders must nod, he supposed\u2026 or was the eunuch playing a deeper and more subtle game than he knew? \u201cYou have my thanks, ser.\u201d\n\u201cWill you grant me the boon I asked of you?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Lancel wanted his own command in the next battle. A splendid way to die before he finished growing that mustache, but young knights always think themselves invincible.\nTyrion lingered after his cousin had slipped away. At the Warrior\u2019s altar, he used one candle to light another. Watch over my brother, you bloody bastard, he\u2019s one of yours. He lit a second candle to the Stranger, for himself.\nThat night, when the Red Keep was dark, Bronn arrived to find him sealing a letter. \u201cTake this to Ser Jacelyn Bywater.\u201d The dwarf dribbled hot golden wax down onto the parchment.\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Bronn could not read, so he asked impudent questions.\n\u201cThat he\u2019s to take fifty of his best swords and scout the roseroad.\u201d Tyrion pressed his seal into the soft wax.\n\u201cStannis is more like to come up the kingsroad.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know. Tell Bywater to disregard what\u2019s in the letter and take his men north. He\u2019s to lay a trap along the Rosby road. Lord Gyles will depart for his castle in a day or two, with a dozen men-at-arms, some servants, and my nephew. Prince Tommen may be dressed as a page.\u201d\n\u201cYou want the boy brought back, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I want him taken on to the castle.\u201d Removing the boy from the city was one of his sister\u2019s better notions, Tyrion had decided. At Rosby, Tommen would be safe from the mob, and keeping him apart from his brother also made things more difficult for Stannis; even if he took King\u2019s Landing and executed Joffrey, he\u2019d still have a Lannister claimant to contend with. \u201cLord Gyles is too sickly to run and too craven to fight. He\u2019ll command his castellan to open the gates. Once inside the walls, Bywater is to expel the garrison and hold Tommen there safe. Ask him how he likes the sound of Lord Bywater.\u201d\n\u201cLord Bronn would sound better. I could grab the boy for you just as well. I\u2019ll dandle him on my knee and sing him nursery songs if there\u2019s a lordship in it.\u201d\n\u201cI need you here,\u201d said Tyrion. And I don\u2019t trust you with my nephew. Should any ill befall Joffrey, the Lannister claim to the Iron Throne would rest on Tommen\u2019s young shoulders. Ser Jacelyn\u2019s gold cloaks would defend the boy; Bronn\u2019s sellswords were more apt to sell him to his enemies.\n\u201cWhat should the new lord do with the old one?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever he pleases, so long as he remembers to feed him. I don\u2019t want him dying.\u201d Tyrion pushed away from the table. \u201cMy sister will send one of the Kingsguard with the prince.\u201d\nBronn was not concerned. \u201cThe Hound is Joffrey\u2019s dog, he won\u2019t leave him. Ironhand\u2019s gold cloaks should be able to handle the others easy enough.\u201d\n\u201cIf it comes to killing, tell Ser Jacelyn I won\u2019t have it done in front of Tommen.\u201d Tyrion donned a heavy cloak of dark brown wool. \u201cMy nephew is tender-hearted.\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain he\u2019s a Lannister?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain of nothing but winter and battle,\u201d he said. \u201cCome. I\u2019m riding with you part of the way.\u201d\n\u201cChataya\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cYou know me too well.\u201d\nThey left through a postern gate in the north wall. Tyrion put his heels into his horse and clattered down Shadowblack Lane. A few furtive shapes darted into alleys at the sound of hoofbeats on the cobbles, but no one dared accost them. The council had extended his curfew; it was death to be taken on the streets after the evenfall bells had sung. The measure had restored a degree of peace to King\u2019s Landing and quartered the number of corpses found in the alleys of a morning, yet Varys said the people cursed him for it. They should be thankful they have the breath to curse. A pair of gold cloaks confronted them as they were making their way along Coppersmith\u2019s Wynd, but when they realized whom they\u2019d challenged they begged the Hand\u2019s pardons and waved them on. Bronn turned south for the Mud Gate and they parted company.\nTyrion rode on toward Chataya\u2019s, but suddenly his patience deserted him. He twisted in the saddle, scanning the street behind. There were no signs of followers. Every window was dark or tightly shuttered. He heard nothing but the wind swirling down the alleys. If Cersei has someone stalking me tonight, he must be disguised as a rat. \u201cBugger it all,\u201d he muttered. He was sick of caution. Wheeling his horse around, he dug in his spurs. If anyone\u2019s after me, we\u2019ll see how well they ride. He flew through the moonlight streets, clattering over cobbles, darting down narrow alleys and up twisty wynds, racing to his love.\nAs he hammered on the gate he heard music wafting faintly over the spiked stone walls. One of the Ibbenese ushered him inside. Tyrion gave the man his horse and said, \u201cWho is that?\u201d The diamond-shaped panes of the longhall windows shone with yellow light, and he could hear a man singing.\nThe Ibbenese shrugged. \u201cFatbelly singer.\u201d\nThe sound swelled as he walked from the stable to the house. Tyrion had never been fond of singers, and he liked this one even less than the run of the breed, sight unseen. When he pushed open the door, the man broke off. \u201cMy lord Hand.\u201d He knelt, balding and kettle-bellied, murmuring, \u201cAn honor, an honor.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord.\u201d Shae smiled at the sight of him. He liked that smile, the quick unthinking way it came to her pretty face. The girl wore her purple silk, belted with a cloth-of-silver sash. The colors favored her dark hair and the smooth cream of her skin.\n\u201cSweetling,\u201d he called her. \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d\nThe singer raised his eyes. \u201cI am called Symon Silver Tongue, my lord. A player, a singer, a taleteller\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd a great fool,\u201d Tyrion finished. \u201cWhat did you call me, when I entered?\u201d\n\u201cCall? I only\u2026\u201d The silver in Symon\u2019s tongue seemed to have turned to lead. \u201cMy lord Hand, I said, an honor\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA wiser man would have pretended not to recognize me. Not that I would have been fooled, but you ought to have tried. What am I to do with you now? You know of my sweet Shae, you know where she dwells, you know that I visit by night alone.\u201d\n\u201cI swear, I\u2019ll tell no one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOn that much we agree. Good night to you.\u201d Tyrion led Shae up the stairs.\n\u201cMy singer may never sing again now,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou\u2019ve scared the voice from him.\u201d\n\u201cA little fear will help him reach those high notes.\u201d\nShe closed the door to their bedchamber. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt him, will you?\u201d She lit a scented candle and knelt to pull off his boots. \u201cHis songs cheer me on the nights you don\u2019t come.\u201d\n\u201cWould that I could come every night,\u201d he said as she rubbed his bare feet. \u201cHow well does he sing?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than some. Not so good as others.\u201d\nTyrion opened her robe and buried his face between her breasts. She always smelled clean to him, even in this reeking sty of a city. \u201cKeep him if you like, but keep him close. I won\u2019t have him wandering the city spreading tales in pot-shops.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t\u2014\u201d she started.\nTyrion covered her mouth with his own. He\u2019d had talk enough; he needed the sweet simplicity of the pleasure he found between Shae\u2019s thighs. Here, at least, he was welcome, wanted.\nAfterward, he eased his arm out from under her head, slipped on his tunic, and went down to the garden. A half-moon silvered the leaves of the fruit trees and shone on the surface of the stone bathing pond. Tyrion seated himself beside the water. Somewhere off to his right a cricket was chirping, a curiously homey sound. It is peaceful here, he thought, but for how long?\nA whiff of something rank made him turn his head. Shae stood in the door behind him, dressed in the silvery robe he\u2019d given her. I loved a maid as white as winter, with moonglow in her hair. Behind her stood one of the begging brothers, a portly man in filthy patched robes, his bare feet crusty with dirt, a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a septon would have worn a crystal. The smell of him would have gagged a rat.\n\u201cLord Varys has come to see you,\u201d Shae announced.\nThe begging brother blinked at her, astonished. Tyrion laughed. \u201cTo be sure. How is it you knew him when I did not?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s still him. Only dressed different.\u201d\n\u201cA different look, a different smell, a different way of walking,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cMost men would be deceived.\u201d\n\u201cAnd most women, maybe. But not whores. A whore learns to see the man, not his garb, or she turns up dead in an alley.\u201d\nVarys looked pained, and not because of the false scabs on his feet. Tyrion chuckled. \u201cShae, would you bring us some wine?\u201d He might need a drink. Whatever brought the eunuch here in the dead of night was not like to be good.\n\u201cI almost fear to tell you why I\u2019ve come, my lord,\u201d Varys said when Shae had left them. \u201cI bring dire tidings.\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to dress in black feathers, Varys, you\u2019re as bad an omen as any raven.\u201d Awkwardly, Tyrion pushed to his feet, half afraid to ask the next question. \u201cIs it Jaime?\u201d If they have harmed him, nothing will save them.\n\u201cNo, my lord. A different matter. Ser Cortnay Penrose is dead. Storm\u2019s End has opened its gates to Stannis Baratheon.\u201d\nDismay drove all other thoughts from Tyrion\u2019s mind. When Shae returned with the wine, he took one sip and flung the cup away to explode against the side of the house. She raised a hand to shield herself from the shards as the wine ran down the stones in long fingers, black in the moonlight. \u201cDamn him!\u201d Tyrion said.\nVarys smiled, showing a mouth full of rotted teeth. \u201cWho, my lord? Ser Cortnay or Lord Stannis?\u201d\n\u201cBoth of them.\u201d Storm\u2019s End was strong, it should have been able to hold out for half a year or more\u2026 time enough for his father to finish with Robb Stark. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\nVarys glanced at Shae. \u201cMy lord, must we trouble your sweet lady\u2019s sleep with such grim and bloody talk?\u201d\n\u201cA lady might be afraid,\u201d said Shae, \u201cbut I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYou should be,\u201d Tyrion told her. \u201cWith Storm\u2019s End fallen, Stannis will soon turn his attention toward King\u2019s Landing.\u201d He regretted flinging away that wine now. \u201cLord Varys, give us a moment, and I\u2019ll ride back to the castle with you.\u201d\n\u201cI shall wait in the stables.\u201d He bowed and stomped off.\nTyrion drew Shae down beside him. \u201cYou are not safe here.\u201d\n\u201cI have my walls, and the guards you gave me.\u201d\n\u201cSellswords,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cThey like my gold well enough, but will they die for it? As for these walls, a man could stand on another\u2019s shoulders and be over in a heartbeat. A manse much like this one was burned during the riots. They killed the goldsmith who owned it for the crime of having a full larder, just as they tore the High Septon to pieces, raped Lollys half a hundred times, and smashed Ser Aron\u2019s skull in. What do you think they would do if they got their hands on the Hand\u2019s lady?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hand\u2019s whore, you mean?\u201d She looked at him with those big bold eyes of hers. \u201cThough I would be your lady, m\u2019lord. I\u2019d dress in all the beautiful things you gave me, in satin and samite and cloth-of-gold, and I\u2019d wear your jewels and hold your hand and sit by you at feasts. I could give you sons, I know I could\u2026 and I vow I\u2019d never shame you.\u201d\nMy love for you shames me enough. \u201cA sweet dream, Shae. Now put it aside, I beg you. It can never be.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the queen? I\u2019m not afraid of her either.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cThen kill her and be done with it. It\u2019s not as if there was any love between you.\u201d\nTyrion sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister. The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men. Moreover, whatever you and I may think of Cersei, my father and brother hold her dear. I can scheme with any man in the Seven Kingdoms, but the gods have not equipped me to face Jaime with swords in hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe Young Wolf and Lord Stannis have swords and they don\u2019t scare you.\u201d\nHow little you know, sweetling. \u201cAgainst them I have all the power of House Lannister. Against Jaime or my father, I have no more than a twisted back and a pair of stunted legs.\u201d\n\u201cYou have me.\u201d Shae kissed him, her arms sliding around his neck as she pressed her body to his.\nThe kiss aroused him, as her kisses always did, but this time Tyrion gently disentangled himself. \u201cNot now. Sweetling, I have\u2026 well, call it the seed of a plan. I think I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.\u201d\nShae\u2019s face went still. \u201cThe kitchens?\u201d\n\u201cYes. If I act through Varys, no one will be the wiser.\u201d\nShe giggled. \u201cM\u2019lord, I\u2019d poison you. Every man who\u2019s tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.\u201d\n\u201cThe Red Keep has sufficient cooks. Butchers and bakers too. You\u2019d need to pose as a scullion.\u201d\n\u201cA pot girl,\u201d she said, \u201cin scratchy brown roughspun. Is that how m\u2019lord wants to see me?\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord wants to see you alive,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cYou can scarcely scour pots in silk and velvet.\u201d\n\u201cHas m\u2019lord grown tired of me?\u201d She reached a hand under his tunic and found his cock. In two quick strokes she had it hard. \u201cHe still wants me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWould you like to fuck your kitchen wench, m\u2019lord? You can dust me with flour and suck gravy off my titties if you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop it.\u201d The way she was acting reminded him of Dancy, who had tried so hard to win her wager. He yanked her hand away to keep her from further mischief. \u201cThis is not the time for bed sport, Shae. Your life may be at stake.\u201d\nHer grin was gone. \u201cIf I\u2019ve displeased m\u2019lord, I never meant it, only\u2026 couldn\u2019t you just give me more guards?\u201d\nTyrion breathed a deep sigh. Remember how young she is, he told himself. He took her hand. \u201cYour gems can be replaced, and new gowns can be sewn twice as lovely as the old. To me, you\u2019re the most precious thing within these walls. The Red Keep is not safe either, but it\u2019s a deal safer than here. I want you there.\u201d\n\u201cIn the kitchens.\u201d Her voice was flat. \u201cScouring pots.\u201d\n\u201cFor a short while.\u201d\n\u201cMy father made me his kitchen wench,\u201d she said, her mouth twisting. \u201cThat was why I ran off.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me you ran off because your father made you his whore,\u201d he reminded her.\n\u201cThat too. I didn\u2019t like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me.\u201d She tossed her head. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you keep me in your tower? Half the lords at court keep bedwarmers.\u201d\n\u201cI was expressly forbidden to take you to court.\u201d\n\u201cBy your stupid father.\u201d Shae pouted. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to keep all the whores you want. Does he take you for a beardless boy? What could he do, spank you?\u201d\nHe slapped her. Not hard, but hard enough. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he said. \u201cDamn you. Never mock me. Not you.\u201d\nFor a moment Shae did not speak. The only sound was the cricket, chirping, chirping. \u201cBeg pardon, m\u2019lord,\u201d she said at last, in a heavy wooden voice. \u201cI never meant to be impudent.\u201d\nAnd I never meant to strike you. Gods be good, am I turning into Cersei? \u201cThat was ill done,\u201d he said. \u201cOn both our parts. Shae, you do not understand.\u201d Words he had never meant to speak came tumbling out of him like mummers from a hollow horse. \u201cWhen I was thirteen, I wed a crofter\u2019s daughter. Or so I thought her. I was blind with love for her, and thought she felt the same for me, but my father rubbed my face in the truth. My bride was a whore Jaime had hired to give me my first taste of manhood.\u201d And I believed all of it, fool that I was. \u201cTo drive the lesson home, Lord Tywin gave my wife to a barracks of his guardsmen to use as they pleased, and commanded me to watch.\u201d And to take her one last time, after the rest were done. One last time, with no trace of love or tenderness remaining. \u201cSo you will remember her as she truly is,\u201d he said, and I should have defied him, but my cock betrayed me, and I did as I was bid. \u201cAfter he was done with her, my father had the marriage undone. It was as if we had never been wed, the septons said.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s have no more talk of the Tower of the Hand. You will be in the kitchens only a little while. Once we\u2019re done with Stannis, you\u2019ll have another manse, and silks as soft as your hands.\u201d\nShae\u2019s eyes had grown large but he could not read what lay behind them. \u201cMy hands won\u2019t be soft if I clean ovens and scrape plates all day. Will you still want them touching you when they\u2019re all red and raw and cracked from hot water and lye soap?\u201d\n\u201cMore than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at them, they\u2019ll remind me how brave you were.\u201d\nHe could not say if she believed him. She lowered her eyes. \u201cI am yours to command, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nIt was as much acceptance as she could give tonight, he saw that plain enough. He kissed her cheek where he\u2019d struck her, to take some sting from the blow. \u201cI will send for you.\u201d\nVarys was waiting in the stables, as promised. His horse looked spavined and half-dead. Tyrion mounted up; one of the sellswords opened the gates. They rode out in silence. Why did I tell her about Tysha, gods help me? he asked himself, suddenly afraid. There were some secrets that should never be spoken, some shames a man should take to his grave. What did he want from her, forgiveness? The way she had looked at him, what did that mean? Did she hate the thought of scouring pots that much, or was it his confession? How could I tell her that and still think she would love me? part of him said, and another part mocked, saying, Fool of a dwarf, it is only the gold and jewels the whore loves.\nHis scarred elbow was throbbing, jarred every time the horse set down a hoof. Sometimes he could almost fancy he heard the bones grinding together inside. Perhaps he should see a maester, get some potion for the pain\u2026 but since Pycelle had revealed himself for what he was, Tyrion Lannister mistrusted the maesters. The gods only knew who they were conspiring with, or what they had mixed in those potions they gave you. \u201cVarys,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to bring Shae into the castle without Cersei becoming aware.\u201d Briefly, he sketched out his kitchen scheme.\nWhen he was done, the eunuch made a little clucking sound. \u201cI will do as my lord commands, of course\u2026 but I must warn you, the kitchens are full of eyes and ears. Even if the girl falls under no particular suspicion, she will be subject to a thousand questions. Where was she born? Who were her parents? How did she come to King\u2019s Landing? The truth will never do, so she must lie\u2026 and lie, and lie.\u201d He glanced down at Tyrion. \u201cAnd such a pretty young kitchen wench will incite lust as well as curiosity. She will be touched, pinched, patted, and fondled. Pot boys will crawl under her blankets of a night. Some lonely cook may seek to wed her. Bakers will knead her breasts with floured hands.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner have her fondled than stabbed,\u201d said Tyrion.\nVarys rode on a few paces and said, \u201cIt might be that there is another way. As it happens, the maidservant who attends Lady Tanda\u2019s daughter has been filching her jewels. Were I to inform Lady Tanda, she would be forced to dismiss the girl at once. And the daughter would require a new maidservant.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d This had possibilities, Tyrion saw at once. A lady\u2019s bedmaid wore finer garb than a scullion, and often even a jewel or two. Shae should be pleased by that. And Cersei thought Lady Tanda tedious and hysterical, and Lollys a bovine lackwit. She was not like to pay them any friendly calls.\n\u201cLollys is timid and trusting,\u201d Varys said. \u201cShe will accept any tale she is told. Since the mob took her maidenhood she is afraid to leave her chambers, so Shae will be out of sight\u2026 but conveniently close, should you have need of comfort.\u201d\n\u201cThe Tower of the Hand is watched, you know as well as I. Cersei would be certain to grow curious if Lollys\u2019s bedmaid starting paying me calls.\u201d\n\u201cI might be able to slip the child into your bedchamber unseen. Chataya\u2019s is not the only house to boast a hidden door.\u201d\n\u201cA secret access? To my chambers?\u201d Tyrion was more annoyed than surprised. Why else would Maegor the Cruel have ordered death for all the builders who had worked on his castle, except to preserve such secrets? \u201cYes, I suppose there would be. Where will I find the door? In my solar? My bedchamber?\u201d\n\u201cMy friend, you would not force me to reveal all my little secrets, would you?\u201d\n\u201cHenceforth think of them as our little secrets, Varys.\u201d Tyrion glanced up at the eunuch in his smelly mummer\u2019s garb. \u201cAssuming you are on my side\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCan you doubt it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy no, I trust you implicitly.\u201d A bitter laugh echoed off the shuttered windows. \u201cI trust you like one of my own blood, in truth. Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died.\u201d\n\u201cIt is said that he threw himself from a tower.\u201d\n\u201cThrew himself? No, I will not believe that!\u201d\n\u201cHis guards saw no man enter his chambers, nor did they find any within afterward.\u201d\n\u201cThen the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed,\u201d Tyrion suggested, \u201cor he climbed down from the roof on a rope. Perhaps the guards are lying. Who\u2019s to say they did not do the thing themselves?\u201d\n\u201cDoubtless you are right, my lord.\u201d\nHis smug tone said otherwise. \u201cBut you do not think so? How was it done, then?\u201d\nFor a long moment Varys said nothing. The only sound was the stately clack of horseshoes on cobbles. Finally the eunuch cleared his throat. \u201cMy lord, do you believe in the old powers?\u201d\n\u201cMagic, you mean?\u201d Tyrion said impatiently. \u201cBloodspells, curses, shapeshifting, those sorts of things?\u201d He snorted. \u201cDo you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to his death?\u201d\n\u201cSer Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning he died. I ask you, is this the act of a man lost to despair? Then there is the matter of Lord Renly\u2019s mysterious and most fortuitous murder, even as his battle lines were forming up to sweep his brother from the field.\u201d The eunuch paused a moment. \u201cMy lord, you once asked me how it was that I was cut.\u201d\n\u201cI recall,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cYou did not want to talk of it.\u201d\n\u201cNor do I, but\u2026\u201d This pause was longer than the one before, and when Varys spoke again his voice was different somehow. \u201cI was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly. Our master owned a fat little cog and we sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King\u2019s Landing.\n\u201cOne day at Myr, a certain man came to our folly. After the performance, he made an offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse. I was in terror. I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke.\n\u201cThe mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me. Once I had served his purpose, the man had no further interest in me, so he put me out. When I asked him what I should do now, he answered that he supposed I should die. To spite him, I resolved to live. I begged, I stole, and I sold what parts of my body still remained to me. Soon I was as good a thief as any in Myr, and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man\u2019s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.\n\u201cYet I still dream of that night, my lord. Not of the sorcerer, nor his blade, nor even the way my manhood shriveled as it burned. I dream of the voice. The voice from the flames. Was it a god, a demon, some conjurer\u2019s trick? I could not tell you, and I know all the tricks. All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered, and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it. If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see him dead.\u201d\nWhen he was done, they rode in silence for a time. Finally Tyrion said, \u201cA harrowing tale. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe eunuch sighed. \u201cYou are sorry, but you do not believe me. No, my lord, no need to apologize. I was drugged and in pain and it was a very long time ago and far across the sea. No doubt I dreamed that voice. I\u2019ve told myself as much a thousand times.\u201d\n\u201cI believe in steel swords, gold coins, and men\u2019s wits,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cAnd I believe there once were dragons. I\u2019ve seen their skulls, after all.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope that is the worst thing you ever see, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cOn that we agree.\u201d Tyrion smiled. \u201cAnd for Ser Cortnay\u2019s death, well, we know Stannis hired sellsails from the Free Cities. Perhaps he bought himself a skilled assassin as well.\u201d\n\u201cA very skilled assassin.\u201d\n\u201cThere are such. I used to dream that one day I\u2019d be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.\u201d\n\u201cRegardless of how Ser Cortnay died,\u201d said Varys, \u201che is dead, the castle fallen. Stannis is free to march.\u201d\n\u201cAny chance we might convince the Dornishmen to descend on the Marches?\u201d asked Tyrion.\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cA pity. Well, the threat may serve to keep the Marcher lords close to their castles, at least. What news of my father?\u201d\n\u201cIf Lord Tywin has won across the Red Fork, no word has reached me yet. If he does not hasten, he may be trapped between his foes. The Oakheart leaf and the Rowan tree have been seen north of the Mander.\u201d\n\u201cNo word from Littlefinger?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he never reached Bitterbridge. Or perhaps he\u2019s died there. Lord Tarly has seized Renly\u2019s stores and put a great many to the sword; Florents, chiefly. Lord Caswell has shut himself up in his castle.\u201d\nTyrion threw back his head and laughed.\nVarys reined up, nonplussed. \u201cMy lord?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see the jest, Lord Varys?\u201d Tyrion waved a hand at the shuttered windows, at all the sleeping city. \u201cStorm\u2019s End is fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and the gods alone know what dark powers, and the good folk don\u2019t have Jaime to protect them, nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor their precious Knight of Flowers. Only me, the one they hate.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cThe dwarf, the evil counselor, the twisted little monkey demon. I\u2019m all that stands between them and chaos.\u201d",

      "content": "Catelyn\n\u201cTell Father I have gone to make him proud.\u201d Her brother swung up into his saddle, every inch the lord in his bright mail and flowing mud-and-water cloak. A silver trout ornamented the crest of his greathelm, twin to the one painted on his shield.\n\u201cHe was always proud of you, Edmure. And he loves you fiercely. Believe that.\u201d\n\u201cI mean to give him better reason than mere birth.\u201d He wheeled his warhorse about and raised a hand. Trumpets sounded, a drum began to boom, the drawbridge descended in fits and starts, and Ser Edmure Tully led his men out from Riverrun with lances raised and banners streaming.\nI have a greater host than yours, brother, Catelyn thought as she watched them go. A host of doubts and fears.\nBeside her, Brienne\u2019s misery was almost palpable. Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to her measure, handsome gowns to suit her birth and sex, yet still she preferred to dress in oddments of mail and boiled leather, a swordbelt cinched around her waist. She would have been happier riding to war with Edmure, no doubt, but even walls as strong as Riverrun\u2019s required swords to hold them. Her brother had taken every able-bodied man for the fords, leaving Ser Desmond Grell to command a garrison made up of the wounded, the old, and the sick, along with a few squires and some untrained peasant boys still shy of manhood. This, to defend a castle crammed full of women and children.\nWhen the last of Edmure\u2019s foot had shuffled under the portcullis, Brienne asked, \u201cWhat shall we do now, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cOur duty.\u201d Catelyn\u2019s face was drawn as she started across the yard. I have always done my duty, she thought. Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all his children. Her two older brothers had both died in infancy, so she had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born. Then her mother had died and her father had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now, and she had done that too. And when Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark, she had thanked him for making her such a splendid match.\nI gave Brandon my favor to wear, and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded, nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off. And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother, I did so gladly, though I never saw Ned\u2019s face until our wedding day. I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent him off to his war and his king and the woman who bore him his bastard, because I always did my duty.\nHer steps took her to the sept, a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst her mother\u2019s gardens and filled with rainbow light. It was crowded when they entered; Catelyn was not alone in her need for prayer. She knelt before the painted marble image of the Warrior and lit a scented candle for Edmure and another for Robb off beyond the hills. Keep them safe and help them to victory, she prayed, and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those they leave behind.\nThe septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at her prayers, so Catelyn lingered for the celebration. She did not know this septon, an earnest young man close to Edmure\u2019s age. He performed his office well enough, and his voice was rich and pleasant when he sang the praises to the Seven, but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd, long dead. Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what she had seen and felt in Renly\u2019s pavilion, and he might have known what it meant as well, and what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams. Osmynd, my father, Uncle Brynden, old Maester Kym, they always seemed to know everything, but now there is only me, and it seems I know nothing, not even my duty. How can I do my duty if I do not know where it lies?\nCatelyn\u2019s knees were stiff by the time she rose, though she felt no wiser. Perhaps she would go to the godswood tonight, and pray to Ned\u2019s gods as well. They were older than the Seven.\nOutside, she found song of a very different sort. Rymund the Rhymer sat by the brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners, his deep voice ringing as he sang of Lord Deremond at the Bloody Meadow.\nAnd there he stood with sword in hand,the last of Darry\u2019s ten\u2026\nBrienne paused to listen for a moment, broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against her chest. A mob of ragged boys raced by, screeching and flailing at each other with sticks. Why do boys so love to play at war? Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer. The singer\u2019s voice swelled as he neared the end of his song.\nAnd red the grass beneath his feet,and red his banners bright,and red the glow of setting sunthat bathed him in its light.\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d the great lord called,\u201cmy sword is hungry still.\u201dAnd with a cry of savage rage,They swarmed across the rill\u2026\n\u201cFighting is better than this waiting,\u201d Brienne said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel so helpless when you fight. You have a sword and a horse, sometimes an axe. When you\u2019re armored it\u2019s hard for anyone to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cKnights die in battle,\u201d Catelyn reminded her.\nBrienne looked at her with those blue and beautiful eyes. \u201cAs ladies die in childbed. No one sings songs about them.\u201d\n\u201cChildren are a battle of a different sort.\u201d Catelyn started across the yard. \u201cA battle without banners or warhorns, but no less fierce. Carrying a child, bringing it into the world\u2026 your mother will have told you of the pain\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI never knew my mother,\u201d Brienne said. \u201cMy father had ladies\u2026 a different lady every year, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThose were no ladies,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cAs hard as birth can be, Brienne, what comes after is even harder. At times I feel as though I am being torn apart. Would that there were five of me, one for each child, so I might keep them all safe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who would keep you safe, my lady?\u201d\nHer smile was wan and tired. \u201cWhy, the men of my House. Or so my lady mother taught me. My lord father, my brother, my uncle, my husband, they will keep me safe\u2026 but while they are away from me, I suppose you must fill their place, Brienne.\u201d\nBrienne bowed her head. \u201cI shall try, my lady.\u201d\nLater that day, Maester Vyman brought a letter. She saw him at once, hoping for some word from Robb, or from Ser Rodrik in Winterfell, but the message proved to be from one Lord Meadows, who named himself castellan of Storm\u2019s End. It was addressed to her father, her brother, her son, \u201cor whoever now holds Riverrun.\u201d Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead, the man wrote, and Storm\u2019s End had opened its gate to Stannis Baratheon, the trueborn and rightful heir. The castle garrison had sworn their swords to his cause, one and all, and no man of them had suffered harm.\n\u201cSave Cortnay Penrose,\u201d Catelyn murmured. She had never met the man, yet she grieved to hear of his passing. \u201cRobb should know of this at once,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we know where he is?\u201d\n\u201cAt last word he was marching toward the Crag, the seat of House Westerling,\u201d said Maester Vyman. \u201cIf I dispatched a raven to Ashemark, it may be that they could send a rider after him.\u201d\n\u201cDo so.\u201d\nCatelyn read the letter again after the maester was gone. \u201cLord Meadows says nothing of Robert\u2019s bastard,\u201d she confided to Brienne. \u201cI suppose he yielded the boy with the rest, though I confess, I do not understand why Stannis wanted him so badly.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he fears the boy\u2019s claim.\u201d\n\u201cA bastard\u2019s claim? No, it\u2019s something else\u2026 what does this child look like?\u201d\n\u201cHe is seven or eight, comely, with black hair and bright blue eyes. Visitors oft thought him Lord Renly\u2019s own son.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Renly favored Robert.\u201d Catelyn had a glimmer of understanding. \u201cStannis means to parade his brother\u2019s bastard before the realm, so men might see Robert in his face and wonder why there is no such likeness in Joffrey.\u201d\n\u201cWould that mean so much?\u201d\n\u201cThose who favor Stannis will call it proof. Those who support Joffrey will say it means nothing.\u201d Her own children had more Tully about them than Stark. Arya was the only one to show much of Ned in her features. And Jon Snow, but he was never mine. She found herself thinking of Jon\u2019s mother, that shadowy secret love her husband would never speak of. Does she grieve for Ned as I do? Or did she hate him for leaving her bed for mine? Does she pray for her son as I have prayed for mine?\nThey were uncomfortable thoughts, and futile. If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall, as some whispered, the lady was long dead; if not, Catelyn had no clue who or where his mother might be. And it made no matter. Ned was gone now, and his loves and his secrets had all died with him.\nStill, she was struck again by how strangely men behaved when it came to their bastards. Ned had always been fiercely protective of Jon, and Ser Cortnay Penrose had given up his life for this Edric Storm, yet Roose Bolton\u2019s bastard had meant less to him than one of his dogs, to judge from the tone of the queer cold letter Edmure had gotten from him not three days past. He had crossed the Trident and was marching on Harrenhal as commanded, he wrote. \u201cA strong castle, and well garrisoned, but His Grace shall have it, if I must kill every living soul within to make it so.\u201d He hoped His Grace would weigh that against the crimes of his bastard son, whom Ser Rodrik Cassel had put to death. \u201cA fate he no doubt earned,\u201d Bolton had written. \u201cTainted blood is ever treacherous, and Ramsay\u2019s nature was sly, greedy, and cruel. I count myself well rid of him. The trueborn sons my young wife has promised me would never have been safe while he lived.\u201d\nThe sound of hurrying footsteps drove the morbid thoughts from her head. Ser Desmond\u2019s squire dashed panting into the room and knelt. \u201cMy lady\u2026 Lannisters\u2026 across the river.\u201d\n\u201cTake a long breath, lad, and tell it slowly.\u201d\nHe did as she bid him. \u201cA column of armored men,\u201d he reported. \u201cAcross the Red Fork. They are flying a purple unicorn below the lion of Lannister.\u201d\nSome son of Lord Brax. Brax had come to Riverrun once when she was a girl, to propose wedding one of his sons to her or Lysa. She wondered whether it was this same son out there now, leading the attack.\nThe Lannisters had ridden out of the southeast beneath a blaze of banners, Ser Desmond told her when she ascended to the battlements to join him. \u201cA few outriders, no more,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThe main strength of Lord Tywin\u2019s host is well to the south. We are in no danger here.\u201d\nSouth of the Red Fork the land stretched away open and flat. From the watchtower Catelyn could see for miles. Even so, only the nearest ford was visible. Edmure had entrusted Lord Jason Mallister with its defense, as well as that of three others farther upriver. The Lannister riders were milling about uncertainly near the water, crimson and silver banners flapping in the wind. \u201cNo more than fifty, my lady,\u201d Ser Desmond estimated.\nCatelyn watched the riders spread out in a long line. Lord Jason\u2019s men waited to receive them behind rocks and grass and hillocks. A trumpet blast sent the horsemen forward at a ponderous walk, splashing down into the current. For a moment they made a brave show, all bright armor and streaming banners, the sun flashing off the points of their lances.\n\u201cNow,\u201d she heard Brienne mutter.\nIt was hard to make out what was happening, but the screams of the horses seemed loud even at this remove, and beneath them Catelyn heard the fainter clash of steel on steel. A banner vanished suddenly as its bearer was swept under, and soon after the first dead man drifted past their walls, borne along by the current. By then the Lannisters had pulled back in confusion. She watched as they re-formed, conferred briefly, and galloped back the way they had come. The men on the walls shouted taunts after them, though they were already too far off to hear.\nSer Desmond slapped his belly. \u201cWould that Lord Hoster could have seen that. It would have made him dance.\u201d\n\u201cMy father\u2019s dancing days are past, I fear,\u201d Catelyn said, \u201cand this fight is just begun. The Lannisters will come again. Lord Tywin has twice my brother\u2019s numbers.\u201d\n\u201cHe could have ten times and it would not matter,\u201d Ser Desmond said. \u201cThe west bank of the Red Fork is higher than the east, my lady, and well wooded. Our bowmen have good cover, and a clear field for their shafts\u2026 and should any breach occur, Edmure will have his best knights in reserve, ready to ride wherever they are most sorely needed. The river will hold them.\u201d\n\u201cI pray that you are right,\u201d Catelyn said gravely.\nThat night they came again. She had commanded them to wake her at once if the enemy returned, and well after midnight a serving girl touched her gently by the shoulder. Catelyn sat up at once. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe ford again, my lady.\u201d\nWrapped in a bedrobe, Catelyn climbed to the roof of the keep. From there she could see over the walls and the moonlit river to where the battle raged. The defenders had built watchfires along the bank, and perhaps the Lannisters thought to find them night-blind or unwary. If so, it was folly. Darkness was a chancy ally at best. As they waded in to breast their way across, men stepped in hidden pools and went down splashing, while others stumbled over stones or gashed their feet on the hidden caltrops. The Mallister bowmen sent a storm of fire arrows hissing across the river, strangely beautiful from afar. One man, pierced through a dozen times, his clothes afire, danced and whirled in the knee-deep water until at last he fell and was swept downstream. By the time his body came bobbing past Riverrun, the fires and his life had both been extinguished.\nA small victory, Catelyn thought when the fighting had ended and the surviving foemen had melted back into the night, yet a victory nonetheless. As they descended the winding turret steps, Catelyn asked Brienne for her thoughts. \u201cThat was the brush of Lord Tywin\u2019s fingertip, my lady,\u201d the girl said. \u201cHe is probing, feeling for a weak point, an undefended crossing. If he does not find one, he will curl all his fingers into a fist and try and make one.\u201d Brienne hunched her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Were I him.\u201d Her hand went to the hilt of her sword and gave it a little pat, as if to make certain it was still there.\nAnd may the gods help us then, Catelyn thought. Yet there was nothing she could do for it. That was Edmure\u2019s battle out there on the river; hers was here inside the castle.\nThe next morning as she broke her fast, she sent for her father\u2019s aged steward, Utherydes Wayn. \u201cHave Ser Cleos Frey brought a flagon of wine. I mean to question him soon, and I want his tongue well loosened.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, my lady.\u201d\nNot long after, a rider with the Mallister eagle sewn on his breast arrived with a message from Lord Jason, telling of another skirmish and another victory. Ser Flement Brax had tried to force a crossing at a different ford six leagues to the south. This time the Lannisters shortened their lances and advanced across the river behind on foot, but the Mallister bowmen had rained high arcing shots down over their shields, while the scorpions Edmure had mounted on the riverbank sent heavy stones crashing through to break up the formation. \u201cThey left a dozen dead in the water, only two reaching the shallows, where we dealt with them briskly,\u201d the rider reported. He also told of fighting farther upstream, where Lord Karyl Vance held the fords. \u201cThose thrusts too were turned aside, at grievous cost to our foes.\u201d\nPerhaps Edmure was wiser than I knew, Catelyn thought. His lords all saw the sense in his battle plans, why was I so blind? My brother is not the little boy I remember, no more than Robb is.\nShe waited until evening before going to pay her call upon Ser Cleos Frey, reasoning that the longer she delayed, the drunker he was likely to be. As she entered the tower cell, Ser Cleos stumbled to his knees. \u201cMy lady, I knew naught of any escape. The Imp said a Lannister must needs have a Lannister escort, on my oath as a knight\u2014\u201d\n\u201cArise, ser.\u201d Catelyn seated herself. \u201cI know no grandson of Walder Frey would be an oathbreaker.\u201d Unless it served his purpose. \u201cYou brought peace terms, my brother said.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Ser Cleos lurched to his feet. She was pleased to see how unsteady he was.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she commanded, and he did.\nWhen he was done, Catelyn sat frowning. Edmure had been right, these were no terms at all, except\u2026\u201cLannister will exchange Arya and Sansa for his brother?\u201d\n\u201cYes. He sat on the Iron Throne and swore it.\u201d\n\u201cBefore witnesses?\u201d\n\u201cBefore all the court, my lady. And the gods as well. I said as much to Ser Edmure, but he told me it was not possible, that His Grace Robb would never consent.\u201d\n\u201cHe told you true.\u201d She could not even say that Robb was wrong. Arya and Sansa were children. The Kingslayer, alive and free, was as dangerous as any man in the realm. That road led nowhere. \u201cDid you see my girls? Are they treated well?\u201d\nSer Cleos hesitated. \u201cI\u2026 yes, they seemed\u2026\u201d\nHe is fumbling for a lie, Catelyn realized, but the wine has fuddled his wits. \u201cSer Cleos,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cyou forfeited the protection of your peace banner when your men played us false. Lie to me, and you\u2019ll hang from the walls beside them. Believe that. I shall ask you once more\u2014did you see my daughters?\u201d\nHis brow was damp with sweat. \u201cI saw Sansa at the court, the day Tyrion told me his terms. She looked most beautiful, my lady. Perhaps a, a bit wan. Drawn, as it were.\u201d\nSansa, but not Arya. That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. They might have her locked safely out of sight. Or they might have killed her. Catelyn shoved the thought away. \u201cHis terms, you said\u2026 yet Cersei is Queen Regent.\u201d\n\u201cTyrion spoke for both of them. The queen was not there. She was indisposed that day, I was told.\u201d\n\u201cCurious.\u201d Catelyn thought back to that terrible trek through the Mountains of the Moon, and the way Tyrion Lannister had somehow seduced that sellsword from her service to his own. The dwarf is too clever by half. She could not imagine how he had survived the high road after Lysa had sent him from the Vale, yet it did not surprise her. He had no part in Ned\u2019s murder, at the least. And he came to my defense when the clansmen attacked us. If I could trust his word\u2026\nShe opened her hands to look down at the scars across her fingers. His dagger\u2019s marks, she reminded herself. His dagger, in the hand of the killer he paid to open Bran\u2019s throat. Though the dwarf denied it, to be sure. Even after Lysa locked him in one of her sky cells and threatened him with her moon door, he had still denied it. \u201cHe lied,\u201d she said, rising abruptly. \u201cThe Lannisters are liars every one, and the dwarf is the worst of them. The killer was armed with his own knife.\u201d\nSer Cleos stared. \u201cI know nothing of any\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou know nothing,\u201d she agreed, sweeping from the cell. Brienne fell in beside her, silent. It is simpler for her, Catelyn thought with a pang of envy. She was like a man in that. For men the answer was always the same, and never farther away than the nearest sword. For a woman, a mother, the way was stonier and harder to know.\nShe took a late supper in the Great Hall with her garrison, to give them what encouragement she could. Rymund the Rhymer sang through all the courses, sparing her the need to talk. He closed with the song he had written about Robb\u2019s victory at Oxcross. \u201cAnd the stars in the night were the eyes of his wolves, and the wind itself was their song.\u201d Between the verses, Rymund threw back his head and howled, and by the end, half of the hall was howling along with him, even Desmond Grell, who was well in his cups. Their voices rang off the rafters.\nLet them have their songs, if it makes them brave, Catelyn thought, toying with her silver goblet.\n\u201cThere was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl,\u201d Brienne said quietly. \u201cI learned all the songs by heart.\u201d\n\u201cSansa did the same, though few singers ever cared to make the long journey north to Winterfell.\u201d I told her there would be singers at the king\u2019s court, though. I told her she would hear music of all sorts, that her father could find some master to help her learn the high harp. Oh, gods forgive me\u2026\nBrienne said, \u201cI remember a woman\u2026 she came from some place across the narrow sea. I could not even say what language she sang in, but her voice was as lovely as she was. She had eyes the color of plums and her waist was so tiny my father could put his hands around it. His hands were almost as big as mine.\u201d She closed her long, thick fingers, as if to hide them.\n\u201cDid you sing for your father?\u201d Catelyn asked.\nBrienne shook her head, staring down at her trencher as if to find some answer in the gravy.\n\u201cFor Lord Renly?\u201d\nThe girl reddened. \u201cNever, I\u2026 his fool, he made cruel japes sometimes, and I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomeday you must sing for me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 please, I have no gift.\u201d Brienne pushed back from the table. \u201cForgive me, my lady. Do I have your leave to go?\u201d\nCatelyn nodded. The tall, ungainly girl left the hall with long strides, almost unnoticed amidst the revelry. May the gods go with her, she thought as she returned listlessly to her supper.\nIt was three days later when the hammer blow that Brienne had foretold fell, and five days before they heard of it. Catelyn was sitting with her father when Edmure\u2019s messenger arrived. The man\u2019s armor was dinted, his boots dusty, and he had a ragged hole in his surcoat, but the look on his face as he knelt was enough to tell her that the news was good. \u201cVictory, my lady.\u201d He handed her Edmure\u2019s letter. Her hand trembled as she broke the seal.\nLord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords, her brother wrote, but every thrust had been thrown back. Lord Lefford had been drowned, the Crakehall knight called Strongboar taken captive, Ser Addam Marbrand thrice forced to retreat\u2026 but the fiercest battle had been fought at Stone Mill, where Ser Gregor Clegane had led the assault. So many of his men had fallen that their dead horses threatened to dam the flow. In the end the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank, but Edmure had thrown his reserve at them, and they had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten. Ser Gregor himself had lost his horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around him. \u201cThey shall not cross, Cat,\u201d Edmure scrawled, \u201cLord Tywin is marching to the southeast. A feint perhaps, or full retreat, it matters not. They shall not cross.\u201d\nSer Desmond Grell had been elated. \u201cOh, if only I might have been with him,\u201d the old knight said when she read him the letter. \u201cWhere is that fool Rymund? There\u2019s a song in this, by the gods, and one that even Edmure will want to hear. The mill that ground the Mountain down, I could almost make the words myself, had I the singer\u2019s gift.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear no songs until the fighting\u2019s done,\u201d Catelyn said, perhaps too sharply. Yet she allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word, and agreed when he suggested breaking open some casks in honor of Stone Mill. The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber; they would all be better for a little drink and hope.\nThat night the castle rang to the sounds of celebration. \u201cRiverrun!\u201d the smallfolk shouted, and \u201cTully! Tully!\u201d They\u2019d come frightened and helpless, and her brother had taken them in when most lords would have closed their gates. Their voices floated in through the high windows, and seeped under the heavy redwood doors. Rymund played his harp, accompanied by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes. Catelyn listened to girlish laughter, and the excited chatter of the green boys her brother had left her for a garrison. Good sounds\u2026 and yet they did not touch her. She could not share their happiness.\nIn her father\u2019s solar she found a heavy leatherbound book of maps and opened it to the riverlands. Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced it by flickering candlelight. Marching to the southeast, she thought. By now they had likely reached the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush, she decided.\nShe closed the book even more uneasy than before. The gods had granted them victory after victory. At Stone Mill, at Oxcross, in the Battle of the Camps, at the Whispering Wood\u2026\nBut if we are winning, why am I so afraid?",

      "content": "Bran\nThe sound was the faintest of clinks, a scraping of steel over stone. He lifted his head from his paws, listening, sniffing at the night.\nThe evening\u2019s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat creeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother\u2019s coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he\u2019d killed. Other squirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their little claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.\nAnd he heard it again, clink and scrape. It brought him to his feet. His ears pricked and his tail rose. He howled, a long deep shivery cry, a howl to wake the sleepers, but the piles of man-rock were dark and dead. A still wet night, a night to drive men into their holes. The rain had stopped, but the men still hid from the damp, huddled by the fires in their caves of piled stone.\nHis brother came sliding through the trees, moving almost as quiet as another brother he remembered dimly from long ago, the white one with the eyes of blood. This brother\u2019s eyes were pools of shadow, but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling. He had heard the sounds as well, and known they meant danger.\nThis time the clink and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of skinfeet on stone. The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know. Stranger. Danger. Death.\nHe ran toward the sound, his brother racing beside him. The stone dens rose before them, walls slick and wet. He bared his teeth, but the man-rock took no notice. A gate loomed up, a black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post. When he crashed against it, the gate shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held. Through the bars he could look down the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond, but there was no way through. He could force his muzzle between the bars, but no more. Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth, but they would not break. They had tried to dig under, but there were great flat stones beneath, half-covered by earth and blown leaves.\nSnarling, he paced back and forth in front of the gate, then threw himself at it once more. It moved a little and slammed him back. Locked, something whispered. Chained. The voice he did not hear, the scent without a smell. The other ways were closed as well. Where doors opened in the walls of man-rock, the wood was thick and strong. There was no way out.\nThere is, the whisper came, and it seemed as if he could see the shadow of a great tree covered in needles, slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man. Yet when he looked about, it was not there. The other side of the godswood, the sentinel, hurry, hurry\u2026\nThrough the gloom of night came a muffled shout, cut short.\nSwiftly, swiftly, he whirled and bounded back into the trees, wet leaves rustling beneath his paws, branches whipping at him as he rushed past. He could hear his brother following close. They plunged under the heart tree and around the cold pool, through the blackberry bushes, under a tangle of oaks and ash and hawthorn scrub, to the far side of the wood\u2026 and there it was, the shadow he\u2019d glimpsed without seeing, the slanting tree pointing at the rooftops. Sentinel, came the thought.\nHe remembered how it was to climb it then. The needles everywhere, scratching at his bare face and falling down the back of his neck, the sticky sap on his hands, the sharp piney smell of it. It was an easy tree for a boy to climb, leaning as it did, crooked, the branches so close together they almost made a ladder, slanting right up to the roof.\nGrowling, he sniffed around the base of the tree, lifted a leg and marked it with a stream of urine. A low branch brushed his face, and he snapped at it, twisting and pulling until the wood cracked and tore. His mouth was full of needles and the bitter taste of the sap. He shook his head and snarled.\nHis brother sat back on his haunches and lifted his voice in a ululating howl, his song black with mourning. The way was no way. They were not squirrels, nor the cubs of men, they could not wriggle up the trunks of trees, clinging with soft pink paws and clumsy feet. They were runners, hunters, prowlers.\nOff across the night, beyond the stone that hemmed them close, the dogs woke and began to bark. One and then another and then all of them, a great clamor. They smelled it too; the scent of foes and fear.\nA desperate fury filled him, hot as hunger. He sprang away from the wall loped off beneath the trees, the shadows of branch and leaf dappling his grey fur\u2026 and then he turned and raced back in a rush. His feet flew kicking up wet leaves and pine needles, and for a little time he was a hunter and an antlered stag was fleeing before him and he could see it, smell it, and he ran full out in pursuit. The smell of fear made his heart thunder and slaver ran from his jaws, and he reached the falling tree in stride and threw himself up the trunk, claws scrabbling at the bark for purchase. Upward he bounded, up, two bounds, three, hardly slowing, until he was among the lower limbs. Branches tangled his feet and whipped at his eyes, grey-green needles scattered as he shouldered through them, snapping. He had to slow. Something snagged at his foot and he wrenched it free, snarling. The trunk narrowed under him, the slope steeper, almost straight up, and wet. The bark tore like skin when he tried to claw at it. He was a third of the way up, halfway, more, the roof was almost within reach\u2026 and then he put down a foot and felt it slip off the curve of wet wood, and suddenly he was sliding, stumbling. He yowled in fear and fury, falling, falling, and twisted around while the ground rushed up to break him\u2026\nAnd then Bran was back abed in his lonely tower room, tangled in his blankets, his breath coming hard. \u201cSummer,\u201d he cried aloud. \u201cSummer.\u201d His shoulder seemed to ache, as if he had fallen on it, but he knew it was only the ghost of what the wolf was feeling. Jojen told it true. I am a beastling. Outside he could hear the faint barking of dogs. The sea has come. It\u2019s flowing over the walls, just as Jojen saw. Bran grabbed the bar overhead and pulled himself up, shouting for help. No one came, and after a moment he remembered that no one would. They had taken the guard off his door. Ser Rodrik had needed every man of fighting age he could lay his hands on, so Winterfell had been left with only a token garrison.\nThe rest had left eight days past, six hundred men from Winterfell and the nearest holdfasts. Cley Cerwyn was bringing three hundred more to join them on the march, and Maester Luwin had sent ravens before them, summoning levies from White Harbor and the barrowlands and even the deep places inside the wolfswood. Torrhen\u2019s Square was under attack by some monstrous war chief named Dagmer Cleftjaw. Old Nan said he couldn\u2019t be killed, that once a foe had cut his head in two with an axe, but Dagmer was so fierce he\u2019d just pushed the two halves back together and held them until they healed up. Could Dagmer have won? Torrhen\u2019s Square was many days from Winterfell, yet still\u2026\nBran pulled himself from the bed, moving bar to bar until he reached the windows. His fingers fumbled a little as he swung back the shutters. The yard was empty, and all the windows he could see were black. Winterfell slept. \u201cHodor!\u201d he shouted down, as loud as he could. Hodor would be asleep above the stables, but maybe if he yelled loud enough he\u2019d hear, or somebody would. \u201cHodor, come fast! Osha! Meera, Jojen, anyone!\u201d Bran cupped his hands around his mouth. \u201cHOOOOODOOOOOR!\u201d\nBut when the door crashed open behind him, the man who stepped through was no one Bran knew. He wore a leather jerkin sewn with overlapping iron disks, and carried a dirk in one hand and an axe strapped to his back. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Bran demanded, afraid. \u201cThis is my room. You get out of here.\u201d\nTheon Greyjoy followed him into the bedchamber. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to harm you, Bran.\u201d\n\u201cTheon?\u201d Bran felt dizzy with relief. \u201cDid Robb send you? Is he here too?\u201d\n\u201cRobb\u2019s far away. He can\u2019t help you now.\u201d\n\u201cHelp me?\u201d He was confused. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me, Theon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Prince Theon now. We\u2019re both princes, Bran. Who would have dreamed it? But I\u2019ve taken your castle, my prince.\u201d\n\u201cWinterfell?\u201d Bran shook his head. \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cLeave us, Werlag.\u201d The man with the dirk withdrew. Theon seated himself on the bed. \u201cI sent four men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes, and they opened a postern gate for the rest of us. My men are dealing with yours even now. I promise you, Winterfell is mine.\u201d\nBran did not understand. \u201cBut you\u2019re Father\u2019s ward.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you and your brother are my wards. As soon as the fighting\u2019s done, my men will be bringing the rest of your people together in the Great Hall. You and I are going to speak to them. You\u2019ll tell them how you\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to me, and command them to serve and obey their new lord as they did the old.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Bran. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight you and throw you out. I never yielded, you can\u2019t make me say I did.\u201d\n\u201cThis is no game, Bran, so don\u2019t play the boy with me, I won\u2019t stand for it. The castle is mine, but these people are still yours. If the prince would keep them safe, he\u2019d best do as he\u2019s told.\u201d He rose and went to the door. \u201cSomeone will come dress you and carry you to the Great Hall. Think carefully on what you want to say.\u201d\nThe waiting made Bran feel even more helpless than before. He sat in the window seat, staring out at dark towers and walls black as shadow. Once he thought he heard shouting beyond the Guards Hall, and something that might have been the clash of swords, but he did not have Summer\u2019s ears to hear, nor his nose to smell. Awake, I am still broken, but when I sleep, when I\u2019m Summer, I can run and fight and hear and smell.\nHe had expected that Hodor would come for him, or maybe one of the serving girls, but when the door next opened it was Maester Luwin, carrying a candle. \u201cBran,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2026 know what has happened? You have been told?\u201d The skin was broken above his left eye, and blood ran down that side of his face.\n\u201cTheon came. He said Winterfell was his now.\u201d\nThe maester set down the candle and wiped the blood off his cheek. \u201cThey swam the moat. Climbed the walls with hook and rope. Came over wet and dripping, steel in hand.\u201d He sat on the chair by the door, as fresh blood flowed. \u201cAlebelly was on the gate, they surprised him in the turret and killed him. Hayhead\u2019s wounded as well. I had time to send off two ravens before they burst in. The bird to White Harbor got away, but they brought down the other with an arrow.\u201d The maester stared at the rushes. \u201cSer Rodrik took too many of our men, but I am to blame as much as he is. I never saw this danger, I never\u2026\u201d\nJojen saw it, Bran thought. \u201cYou better help me dress.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so.\u201d In the heavy ironbound chest at the foot of Bran\u2019s bed the maester found smallclothes, breeches, and tunic. \u201cYou are the Stark in Winterfell, and Robb\u2019s heir. You must look princely.\u201d Together they garbed him as befit a lord.\n\u201cTheon wants me to yield the castle,\u201d Bran said as the maester was fastening the cloak with his favorite wolf\u2019s-head clasp of silver and jet.\n\u201cThere is no shame in that. A lord must protect his smallfolk. Cruel places breed cruel peoples, Bran, remember that as you deal with these ironmen. Your lord father did what he could to gentle Theon, but I fear it was too little and too late.\u201d\nThe ironman who came for them was a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard that covered half his chest. He bore the boy easily enough, though he looked none too happy with the task. Rickon\u2019s bedchamber was a half turn down the steps. The four-year-old was cranky at being woken. \u201cI want Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI want her. And Shaggydog too.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother is far away, my prince.\u201d Maester Luwin pulled a bedrobe over the child\u2019s head. \u201cBut I\u2019m here, and Bran.\u201d He took Rickon by the hand and led him out.\nBelow, they came on Meera and Jojen being herded from their room by a bald man whose spear was three feet taller than he was. When Jojen looked at Bran, his eyes were green pools full of sorrow. Other ironmen had rousted the Freys. \u201cYour brother\u2019s lost his kingdom,\u201d Little Walder told Bran. \u201cYou\u2019re no prince now, just a hostage.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Jojen said, \u201cand me, and all of us.\u201d\n\u201cNo one was talking to you, frogeater.\u201d\nOne of the ironmen went before them carrying a torch, but the rain had started again and soon drowned it out. As they hurried across the yard they could hear the direwolves howling in the godswood. I hope Summer wasn\u2019t hurt falling from the tree.\nTheon Greyjoy was seated in the high seat of the Starks. He had taken off his cloak. Over a shirt of fine mail he wore a black surcoat emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House. His hands rested on the wolves\u2019 heads carved at the ends of the wide stone arms. \u201cTheon\u2019s sitting in Robb\u2019s chair,\u201d Rickon said.\n\u201cHush, Rickon.\u201d Bran could feel the menace around them, but his brother was too young. A few torches had been lit, and a fire kindled in the great hearth, but most of the hall remained in darkness. There was no place to sit with the benches stacked against the walls, so the castle folk stood in small groups, not daring to speak. He saw Old Nan, her toothless mouth opening and closing. Hayhead was carried in between two of the other guards, a bloodstained bandage wrapped about his bare chest. Poxy Tym wept inconsolably, and Beth Cassel cried with fear.\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d Theon asked of the Reeds and Freys.\n\u201cThese are Lady Catelyn\u2019s wards, both named Walder Frey,\u201d Maester Luwin explained. \u201cAnd this is Jojen Reed and his sister Meera, son and daughter to Howland Reed of Greywater Watch, who came to renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cSome might call that ill-timed,\u201d said Theon, \u201cthough not for me. Here you are and here you\u2019ll stay.\u201d He vacated the high seat. \u201cBring the prince here, Lorren.\u201d The black-bearded man dumped Bran onto the stone as if he were a sack of oats.\nPeople were still being driven into the Great Hall, prodded along with shouts and the butts of the spears. Gage and Osha arrived from the kitchens, spotted with flour from making the morning bread. Mikken they dragged in cursing. Farlen entered limping, struggling to support Palla. Her dress had been ripped in two; she held it up with a clenched fist and walked as if every step were agony. Septon Chayle rushed to lend a hand, but one of the ironmen knocked him to the floor.\nThe last man marched through the doors was the prisoner Reek, whose stench preceded him, ripe and pungent. Bran felt his stomach twist at the smell of him. \u201cWe found this one locked in a tower cell,\u201d announced his escort, a beardless youth with ginger-colored hair and sodden clothing, doubtless one of those who\u2019d swum the moat. \u201cHe says they call him Reek.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t think why,\u201d Theon said, smiling. \u201cDo you always smell so bad, or did you just finish fucking a pig?\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t fucked no one since they took me, m\u2019lord. Heke\u2019s me true name. I was in service to the Bastard o\u2019 the Dreadfort till the Starks give him an arrow in the back for a wedding gift.\u201d\nTheon found that amusing. \u201cWho did he marry?\u201d\n\u201cThe widow o\u2019 Hornwood, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cThat crone? Was he blind? She has teats like empty wineskins, dry and withered.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her teats he wed her for, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nThe ironmen slammed shut the tall doors at the foot of the hall. From the high seat, Bran could see about twenty of them. He probably left some guards on the gates and the armory. Even so, there couldn\u2019t be more than thirty.\nTheon raised his hands for quiet. \u201cYou all know me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAye, we know you for a sack of steaming dung!\u201d shouted Mikken, before the bald man drove the butt of his spear into his gut, then smashed him across the face with the shaft. The smith stumbled to his knees and spat out a tooth.\n\u201cMikken, you be silent.\u201d Bran tried to sound stern and lordly, the way Robb did when he made a command, but his voice betrayed him and the words came out in a shrill squeak.\n\u201cListen to your little lordling, Mikken,\u201d said Theon. \u201cHe has more sense than you do.\u201d\nA good lord protects his people, he reminded himself. \u201cI\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Theon.\u201d\n\u201cLouder, Bran. And call me prince.\u201d\nHe raised his voice. \u201cI have yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. All of you should do as he commands you.\u201d\n\u201cDamned if I will!\u201d bellowed Mikken.\nTheon ignored the outburst. \u201cMy father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock, and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the north as well, by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.\u201d\n\u201cBugger that.\u201d Mikken wiped the blood from his mouth. \u201cI serve the Starks, not some treasonous squid of\u2014aah.\u201d The butt of the spear smashed him face first into the stone floor.\n\u201cSmiths have strong arms and weak heads,\u201d observed Theon. \u201cBut if the rest of you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, you\u2019ll find me as generous a lord as you could want.\u201d on his hands and knees, Mikken spat blood. Please don\u2019t, Bran wished at him, but the blacksmith shouted, \u201cIf you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o\u2019\u2014\u201d\nThe bald man drove the point of his spear into the back of Mikken\u2019s neck. Steel slid through flesh and came out his throat in a welter of blood. A woman screamed, and Meera wrapped her arms around Rickon. It\u2019s blood he drowned on, Bran thought numbly. His own blood.\n\u201cWho else has something to say?\u201d asked Theon Greyjoy.\n\u201cHodor hodor hodor hodor,\u201d shouted Hodor, eyes wide.\n\u201cSomeone kindly shut that halfwit up.\u201d\nTwo ironmen began to beat Hodor with the butts of their spears. The stableboy dropped to the floor, trying to shield himself with his hands.\n\u201cI will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was.\u201d Theon raised his voice to be heard above the smack of wood on flesh. \u201cBetray me, though, and you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t. And don\u2019t think the men you see here are the whole of my power. Torrhen\u2019s Square and Deepwood Motte will soon be ours as well, and my uncle is sailing up the Saltspear to seize Moat Cailin. If Robb Stark can stave off the Lannisters, he may reign as King of the Trident hereafter, but House Greyjoy holds the north now.\u201d\n\u201cStark\u2019s lords will fight you,\u201d the man Reek called out. \u201cThat bloated pig at White Harbor for one, and them Umbers and Karstarks too. You\u2019ll need men. Free me and I\u2019m yours.\u201d\nTheon weighed him a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re cleverer than you smell, but I could not suffer that stench.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Reek, \u201cI could wash some. If I was free.\u201d\n\u201cA man of rare good sense.\u201d Theon smiled. \u201cBend the knee.\u201d one of the ironmen handed Reek a sword, and he laid it at Theon\u2019s feet and swore obedience to House Greyjoy and King Balon. Bran could not look. The green dream was coming true.\n\u201cM\u2019lord Greyjoy!\u201d Osha stepped past Mikken\u2019s body. \u201cI was brought here captive too. You were there the day I was taken.\u201d\nI thought you were a friend, Bran thought, hurt.\n\u201cI need fighters,\u201d Theon declared, \u201cnot kitchen sluts.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Robb Stark put me in the kitchens. For the best part of a year, I\u2019ve been left to scour kettles, scrape grease, and warm the straw for this one.\u201d She threw a look at Gage. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bellyful of it. Put a spear in my hand again.\u201d\n\u201cI got a spear for you right here,\u201d said the bald man who\u2019d killed Mikken. He grabbed his crotch, grinning.\nOsha drove her bony knee up between his legs. \u201cYou keep that soft pink thing.\u201d She wrested the spear from him and used the butt to knock him off his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll have me the wood and iron.\u201d The bald man writhed on the floor while the other reavers sent up gales of laughter.\nTheon laughed with the rest. \u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep the spear; Stygg can find another. Now bend the knee and swear.\u201d\nWhen no one else rushed forward to pledge service, they were dismissed with a warning to do their work and make no trouble. Hodor was given the task of bearing Bran back to his bed. His face was all ugly from the beating, his nose swollen and one eye closed. \u201cHodor,\u201d he sobbed between cracked lips as he lifted Bran in huge strong arms and bloody hands and carried him back out into the rain.",

      "content": "Arya\n\u201cThere\u2019s ghosts, I know there is.\u201d Hot Pie was kneading bread, his arms floured up to his elbows. \u201cPia saw something in the buttery last night.\u201d\nArya made a rude noise. Pia was always seeing things in the buttery. Usually they were men. \u201cCan I have a tart?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou baked a whole tray.\u201d\n\u201cI need a whole tray. Ser Amory is partial to them.\u201d\nShe hated Ser Amory. \u201cLet\u2019s spit on them.\u201d\nHot Pie looked around nervously. The kitchens were full of shadows and echoes, but the other cooks and scullions were all asleep in the cavernous lofts above the ovens. \u201cHe\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not,\u201d Arya said. \u201cYou can\u2019t taste spit.\u201d\n\u201cIf he does, it\u2019s me they\u2019ll whip.\u201d Hot Pie stopped his kneading. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even be here. It\u2019s the black of night.\u201d\nIt was, but Arya never minded. Even in the black of night, the kitchens were never still; there was always someone rolling dough for the morning bread, stirring a kettle with a long wooden spoon, or butchering a hog for Ser Amory\u2019s breakfast bacon. Tonight it was Hot Pie.\n\u201cIf Pinkeye wakes and finds you gone\u2014\u201d Hot Pie said.\n\u201cPinkeye never wakes.\u201d His true name was Mebble, but everyone called him Pinkeye for his runny eyes. \u201cNot once he\u2019s passed out.\u201d Each morning he broke his fast with ale. Each evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper, wine-colored spit running down his chin. Arya would wait until she heard him snoring, then creep barefoot up the servant\u2019s stair, making no more noise than the mouse she\u2019d been. She carried neither candle nor taper. Syrio had told her once that darkness could be her friend, and he was right. If she had the moon and the stars to see by, that was enough. \u201cI bet we could escape, and Pinkeye wouldn\u2019t even notice I was gone,\u201d she told Hot Pie.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to escape. It\u2019s better here than it was in them woods. I don\u2019t want to eat no worms. Here, sprinkle some flour on the board.\u201d\nArya cocked her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen with your ears, not your mouth. That was a warhorn. Two blasts, didn\u2019t you hear? And there, that\u2019s the portcullis chains, someone\u2019s going out or coming in. Want to go see?\u201d The gates of Harrenhal had not been opened since the morning Lord Tywin had marched with his host.\n\u201cI\u2019m making the morning bread,\u201d Hot Pie complained. \u201cAnyhow I don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s dark, I told you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going. I\u2019ll tell you after. Can I have a tart?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nShe filched one anyway, and ate it on her way out. It was stuffed with chopped nuts and fruit and cheese, the crust flaky and still warm from the oven. Eating Ser Amory\u2019s tart made Arya feel daring. Barefoot surefoot lightfoot, she sang under her breath. I am the ghost in Harrenhal.\nThe horn had stirred the castle from sleep; men were coming out into the ward to see what the commotion was about. Arya fell in with the others. A line of ox carts were rumbling under the portcullis. Plunder, she knew at once. The riders escorting the carts spoke in a babble of queer tongues. Their armor glinted pale in the moonlight, and she saw a pair of striped black-and-white zorses. The Bloody Mummers. Arya withdrew a little deeper into the shadows, and watched as a huge black bear rolled by, caged in the back of a wagon. Other carts were loaded down with silver plate, weapons and shields, bags of flour, pens of squealing hogs and scrawny dogs and chickens. Arya was thinking how long it had been since she\u2019d had a slice off a pork roast when she saw the first of the prisoners.\nBy his bearing and the proud way he held his head, he must have been a lord. She could see mail glinting beneath his torn red surcoat. At first Arya took him for a Lannister, but when he passed near a torch she saw his device was a silver fist, not a lion. His wrists were bound tightly, and a rope around one ankle tied him to the man behind him, and him to the man behind him, so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep. Many of the captives were wounded. If any halted, one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of the whip to get him moving again. She tried to judge how many prisoners there were, but lost count before she got to fifty. There were twice that many at least. Their clothing was stained with mud and blood, and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all their badges and sigils, but some of those Arya glimpsed she recognized. Twin towers. Sunburst. Bloody man. Battle-axe. The battle-axe is for Cerwyn, and the white sun on black is Karstark. They\u2019re northmen. My father\u2019s men, and Robb\u2019s. She didn\u2019t like to think what that might mean.\nThe Bloody Mummers began to dismount. Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to tend their lathered horses. One of the riders was shouting for ale. The noise brought Ser Amory Lorch out onto the covered gallery above the ward, flanked by two torchbearers. Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below him. \u201cMy lord cathellan,\u201d the sellsword said. He had a thick, slobbery voice, as if his tongue was too big for his mouth.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this, Hoat?\u201d Ser Amory demanded, frowning.\n\u201cCaptiths. Rooth Bolton thought to croth the river, but my Brafe Companions cut his van to pieceth. Killed many, and thent Bolton running. Thith ith their lord commander, Glover, and the one behind ith Ther Aenyth Frey.\u201d\nSer Amory Lorch stared down at the roped captives with his little pig eyes. Arya did not think he was pleased. Everyone in the castle knew that he and Vargo Hoat hated each other. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cSer Cadwyn, take these men to the dungeons.\u201d\nThe lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat raised his eyes. \u201cWe were promised honorable treatment\u2014\u201d he began.\n\u201cSilenth!\u201d Vargo Hoat screamed at him, spraying spittle.\nSer Amory addressed the captives. \u201cWhat Hoat promised you is nothing to me. Lord Tywin made me the castellan of Harrenhal, and I shall do with you as I please.\u201d He gestured to his guards. \u201cThe great cell under the Widow\u2019s Tower ought to hold them all. Any who do not care to go are free to die here.\u201d\nAs his men herded off the captives at spearpoint, Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the stairwell, blinking at the torchlight. If he found her missing, he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her, but she was not afraid. He was no Weese. He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one, but Arya never actually knew him to hit. Still, it would be better if he never saw her. She glanced around. The oxen were being unharnessed, the carts unloaded, while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the curious gathered around the caged bear. In the commotion, it was not hard to slip off unseen. She went back the way she had come, wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her and thought to put her to work.\nAway from the gates and the stables, the great castle was largely deserted. The noise dwindled behind her. A swirling wind gusted, drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks in the Wailing Tower. Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood, and she could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings, making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones. Now that Harrenhal was near empty once again, sound did queer things here. Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up noise, shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence. Other times, the echoes had a life of their own, so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army, and every distant voice a ghostly feast. The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie, but not Arya.\nQuiet as a shadow, she flitted across the middle bailey, around the Tower of Dread, and through the empty mews, where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with ghostly wings. She could go where she would. The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men, so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal. The Hall of a Hundred Hearths was closed off, along with many of the lesser buildings, even the Wailing Tower. Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan\u2019s chambers in Kingspyre, themselves as spacious as a lord\u2019s, and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be close at hand. While Lord Tywin had been in residence, there was always a man-at-arms wanting to know your business. But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a thousand doors, and no one seemed to know who should be where, or care much.\nAs she passed the armory, Arya heard the ring of a hammer. A deep orange glow shone through the high windows. She climbed to the roof and peeked down. Gendry was beating out a breastplate. When he worked, nothing existed for him but metal, bellows, fire. The hammer was like part of his arm. She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made. He\u2019s strong, she thought. As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the breastplate into the quenching trough, Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to the floor beside him.\nHe did not seem surprised to see her. \u201cYou should be abed, girl.\u201d The breastplate hissed like a cat as he dipped it in the cold water. \u201cWhat was all that noise?\u201d\n\u201cVargo Hoat\u2019s come back with prisoners. I saw their badges. There\u2019s a Glover, from Deepwood Motte, he\u2019s my father\u2019s man. The rest too, mostly.\u201d All of a sudden, Arya knew why her feet had brought her here. \u201cYou have to help me get them out.\u201d\nGendry laughed. \u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d\n\u201cSer Amory sent them down to the dungeon. The one under the Widow\u2019s Tower, that\u2019s just one big cell. You could smash the door open with your hammer\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhile the guards watch and make bets on how many swings it will take me, maybe?\u201d\nArya chewed her lips. \u201cWe\u2019d need to kill the guards.\u201d\n\u201cHow are we supposed to do that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be a lot of them.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s two, that\u2019s too many for you and me. You never learned nothing in that village, did you? You try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet, the way he does.\u201d Gendry took up the tongs again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\u201cLeave me alone, girl.\u201d\n\u201cGendry, there\u2019s a hundred northmen. Maybe more, I couldn\u2019t count them all. That\u2019s as many as Ser Amory has. Well, not counting the Bloody Mummers. We just have to get them out and we can take over the castle and escape.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t get them out, no more\u2019n you could save Lommy.\u201d Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely. \u201cAnd if we did escape, where would we go?\u201d\n\u201cWinterfell,\u201d she said at once. \u201cI\u2019d tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWould m\u2019lady permit? Could I shoe your horses for you, and make swords for your lordly brothers?\u201d\nSometimes he made her so angry. \u201cYou stop that!\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I wager my feet for the chance to sweat in Winterfell in place of Harrenhal? You know old Ben Blackthumb? He came here as a boy. Smithed for Lady Whent and her father before her and his father before him, and even for Lord Lothston who held Harrenhal before the Whents. Now he smiths for Lord Tywin, and you know what he says? A sword\u2019s a sword, a helm\u2019s a helm, and if you reach in the fire you get burned, no matter who you\u2019re serving. Lucan\u2019s a fair enough master. I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d\n\u201cThe queen will catch you, then. She didn\u2019t send gold cloaks after Ben Blackthumb!\u201d\n\u201cLikely it wasn\u2019t even me they wanted.\u201d\n\u201cIt was too, you know it. You\u2019re somebody.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a \u2019prentice smith, and one day might be I\u2019ll make a master armorer\u2026 if I don\u2019t run off and lose my feet or get myself killed.\u201d He turned away from her, picked up his hammer once more, and began to bang.\nArya\u2019s hands curled into helpless fists. \u201cThe next helm you make, put mule\u2019s ears on it in place of bull\u2019s horns!\u201d She had to flee, or else she would have started hitting him. He probably wouldn\u2019t even feel it if I did. When they find who he is and cut off his stupid mulehead, he\u2019ll be sorry he didn\u2019t help. She was better off without him anyhow. He was the one who got her caught at the village.\nBut thinking of the village made her remember the march, and the storeroom, and the Tickler. She thought of the little boy who\u2019d been hit in the face with the mace, of stupid old All-for-Joffrey, of Lommy Greenhands. I was a sheep, and then I was a mouse, I couldn\u2019t do anything but hide. Arya chewed her lip and tried to think when her courage had come back. Jaqen made me brave again. He made me a ghost instead of a mouse.\nShe had been avoiding the Lorathi since Weese\u2019s death. Chiswyck had been easy, anyone could push a man off the wallwalk, but Weese had raised that ugly spotted dog from a pup, and only some dark magic could have turned the animal against him. Yoren found Jaqen in a black cell, the same as Rorge and Biter, she remembered. Jaqen did something horrible and Yoren knew, that\u2019s why he kept him in chains. If the Lorathi was a wizard, Rorge and Biter could be demons he called up from some hell, not men at all.\nJaqen still owed her one death. In Old Nan\u2019s stories about men who were given magic wishes by a grumkin, you had to be especially careful with the third wish, because it was the last. Chiswyck and Weese hadn\u2019t been very important. The last death has to count, Arya told herself every night when she whispered her names. But now she wondered if that was truly the reason she had hesitated. So long as she could kill with a whisper, Arya need not be afraid of anyone\u2026 but once she used up the last death, she would only be a mouse again.\nWith Pinkeye awake, she dared not go back to her bed. Not knowing where else to hide, she made for the godswood. She liked the sharp smell of the pines and sentinels, the feel of grass and dirt between her toes, and the sound the wind made in the leaves. A slow little stream meandered through the wood, and there was one spot where it had eaten the ground away beneath a deadfall.\nThere, beneath rotting wood and twisted splintered branches, she found her hidden sword.\nGendry was too stubborn to make one for her, so she had made her own by breaking the bristles off a broom. Her blade was much too light and had no proper grip, but she liked the sharp jagged splintery end.\nWhenever she had a free hour she stole away to work at the drills Syrio had taught her, moving barefoot over the fallen leaves, slashing at branches and whacking down leaves. Sometimes she even climbed the trees and danced among the upper branches, her toes gripping the limbs as she moved back and forth, teetering a little less every day as her balance returned to her. Night was the best time; no one ever bothered her at night.\nArya climbed. Up in the kingdom of the leaves, she unsheathed and for a time forgot them all, Ser Amory and the Mummers and her father\u2019s men alike, losing herself in the feel of rough wood beneath the soles of her feet and the swish of sword through air. A broken branch became Joffrey. She struck at it until it fell away. The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the Hound were only leaves, but she killed them all as well, slashing them to wet green ribbons. When her arm grew weary, she sat with her legs over a high limb to catch her breath in the cool dark air, listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted. Through the leafy canopy she could see the bone-white branches of the heart tree. It looks just like the one in Winterfell from here. If only it had been\u2026 then when she climbed down she would have been home again, and maybe find her father sitting under the weirwood where he always sat.\nShoving her sword through her belt, she slipped down branch to branch until she was back on the ground. The light of the moon painted the limbs of the weirwood silvery white as she made her way toward it, but the five-pointed red leaves turned black by night. Arya stared at the face carved into its trunk. It was a terrible face, its mouth twisted, its eyes flaring and full of hate. Is that what a god looked like? Could gods be hurt, the same as people? I should pray, she thought suddenly.\nArya went to her knees. She wasn\u2019t sure how she should begin. She clasped her hands together. Help me, you old gods, she prayed silently. Help me get those men out of the dungeon so we can kill Ser Amory, and bring me home to Winterfell. Make me a water dancer and a wolf and not afraid again, ever.\nWas that enough? Maybe she should pray aloud if she wanted the old gods to hear. Maybe she should pray longer. Sometimes her father had prayed a long time, she remembered. But the old gods had never helped him. Remembering that made her angry. \u201cYou should have saved him,\u201d she scolded the tree. \u201cHe prayed to you all the time. I don\u2019t care if you help me or not. I don\u2019t think you could even if you wanted to.\u201d\n\u201cGods are not mocked, girl.\u201d\nThe voice startled her. She leapt to her feet and drew her wooden sword. Jaqen H\u2019ghar stood so still in the darkness that he seemed one of the trees. \u201cA man comes to hear a name. One and two and then comes three. A man would have done.\u201d\nArya lowered the splintery point toward the ground. \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\n\u201cA man sees. A man hears. A man knows.\u201d\nShe regarded him suspiciously. Had the gods sent him? \u201cHow\u2019d you make the dog kill Weese? Did you call Rorge and Biter up from hell? Is Jaqen H\u2019ghar your true name?\u201d\n\u201cSome men have many names. Weasel. Arry. Arya.\u201d\nShe backed away from him, until she was pressed against the heart tree. \u201cDid Gendry tell?\u201d\n\u201cA man knows,\u201d he said again. \u201cMy lady of Stark.\u201d\nMaybe the gods had sent him in answer to her prayers. \u201cI need you to help me get those men out of the dungeons. That Glover and those others, all of them. We have to kill the guards and open the cell somehow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA girl forgets,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTwo she has had, three were owed. If a guard must die, she needs only speak his name.\u201d\n\u201cBut one guard won\u2019t be enough, we need to kill them all to open the cell.\u201d Arya bit her lip hard to stop from crying. \u201cI want you to save the northmen like I saved you.\u201d\nHe looked down at her pitilessly. \u201cThree lives were snatched from a god. Three lives must be repaid. The gods are not mocked.\u201d His voice was silk and steel.\n\u201cI never mocked.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cThe name\u2026 can I name anyone? And you\u2019ll kill him?\u201d\nJaqen H\u2019ghar inclined his head. \u201cA man has said.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone?\u201d she repeated. \u201cA man, a woman, a little baby, or Lord Tywin, or the High Septon, or your father?\u201d\n\u201cA man\u2019s sire is long dead, but did he live, and did you know his name, he would die at your command.\u201d\n\u201cSwear it,\u201d Arya said. \u201cSwear it by the gods.\u201d\n\u201cBy all the gods of sea and air, and even him of fire, I swear it.\u201d He placed a hand in the mouth of the weirwood. \u201cBy the seven new gods and the old gods beyond count, I swear it.\u201d\nHe has sworn. \u201cEven if I named the king\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSpeak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from this day, it will come. A man does not fly like a bird, but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a king dies.\u201d He knelt beside her, so they were face-to-face, \u201cA girl whispers if she fears to speak aloud. Whisper it now. Is it Joffrey?\u201d\nArya put her lips to his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s Jaqen H\u2019ghar.\u201d\nEven in the burning barn, with walls of flame towering all around and him in chains, he had not seemed so distraught as he did now. \u201cA girl\u2026 she makes a jest.\u201d\n\u201cYou swore. The gods heard you swear.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods did hear,\u201d There was a knife in his hand suddenly, its blade thin as her little finger. Whether it was meant for her or him, Arya could not say. \u201cA girl will weep. A girl will lose her only friend.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my friend. A friend would help me.\u201d She stepped away from him, balanced on the balls of her feet in case he threw his knife. \u201cI\u2019d never kill a friend.\u201d\nJaqen\u2019s smile came and went. \u201cA girl might\u2026 name another name then, if a friend did help?\u201d\n\u201cA girl might,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a friend did help.\u201d\nThe knife vanished. \u201cCome.\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d She had never thought he would act so quickly.\n\u201cA man hears the whisper of sand in a glass. A man will not sleep until a girl unsays a certain name. Now, evil child.\u201d\nI\u2019m not an evil child, she thought, I am a direwolf, and the ghost in Harrenhal. She put her broomstick back in its hiding place and followed him from the godswood.\nDespite the hour, Harrenhal stirred with fitful life. Vargo Hoat\u2019s arrival had thrown off all the routines. Ox carts, oxen, and horses had all vanished from the yard, but the bear cage was still there. It had been hung from the arched span of the bridge that divided the outer and middle wards, suspended on heavy chains, a few feet off the ground. A ring of torches bathed the area in light. Some of the boys from the stables were tossing stones to make the bear roar and grumble. Across the ward, light spilled through the door of the Barracks Hall, accompanied by the clatter of tankards and men calling for more wine. A dozen voices took up a song in a guttural tongue strange to Arya\u2019s ears.\nThey\u2019re drinking and eating before they sleep, she realized. Pinkeye would have sent to wake me, to help with the serving. He\u2019ll know I\u2019m not abed. But likely he was busy pouring for the Brave Companions and those of Ser Amory\u2019s garrison who had joined them. The noise they were making would be a good distraction.\n\u201cThe hungry gods will feast on blood tonight, if a man would do this thing,\u201d Jaqen said. \u201cSweet girl, kind and gentle. Unsay one name and say another and cast this mad dream aside.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cJust so.\u201d He seemed resigned. \u201cThe thing will be done, but a girl must obey. A man has no time for talk.\u201d\n\u201cA girl will obey,\u201d Arya said. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\n\u201cA hundred men are hungry, they must be fed, the lord commands hot broth. A girl must run to the kitchens and tell her pie boy.\u201d\n\u201cBroth,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhere will you be?\u201d\n\u201cA girl will help make broth, and wait in the kitchens until a man comes for her. Go. Run.\u201d\nHot Pie was pulling his loaves from the ovens when she burst into the kitchen, but he was no longer alone. They\u2019d woken the cooks to feed Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers. Serving men were carrying off baskets of Hot Pie\u2019s bread and tarts, the chief cook was carving cold slices off a ham, spit boys were turning rabbits while the pot girls basted them with honey, women were chopping onions and carrots. \u201cWhat do you want, Weasel?\u201d the chief cook asked when he saw her.\n\u201cBroth,\u201d she announced. \u201cMy lord wants broth.\u201d\nHe jerked his carving knife at the black iron kettles hung over the flames. \u201cWhat do you think that is? Though I\u2019d soon as piss in it as serve it to that goat. Can\u2019t even let a man have a night\u2019s sleep.\u201d He spat. \u201cWell, never you mind, run back and tell him a kettle can\u2019t be hurried,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m to wait here until it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cThen stay out of the way. Or better yet, make yourself of use. Run to the buttery; his goatship will be wanting butter and cheese. Wake up Pia and tell her she\u2019d best be nimble for once, if she wants to keep both of her feet.\u201d\nShe ran as fast as she could. Pia was awake in the loft, moaning under one of the Mummers, but she slipped back into her clothes quick enough when she heard Arya shout. She filled six baskets with crocks of butter and big wedges of stinky cheese wrapped in cloth. \u201cHere, help me with these,\u201d she told Arya.\n\u201cI can\u2019t. But you better hurry or Vargo Hoat will chop off your foot.\u201d She darted off before Pia could grab her. On the way back, she wondered why none of the captives had their hands or feet chopped off. Maybe Vargo Hoat was afraid to make Robb angry. Though he didn\u2019t seem the sort to be afraid of anyone.\nHot Pie was stirring the kettles with a long wooden spoon when Arya returned to the kitchens. She grabbed up a second spoon and started to help. For a moment she thought maybe she should tell him, but then she remembered the village and decided not to. He\u2019d only yield again.\nThen she heard the ugly sound of Rorge\u2019s voice. \u201cCook,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019ll take your bloody broth.\u201d Arya let go of the spoon in dismay. I never told him to bring them. Rorge wore his iron helmet, with the nasal that half hid his missing nose. Jaqen and Biter followed him into the kitchen.\n\u201cThe bloody broth isn\u2019t bloody ready yet,\u201d the cook said. \u201cIt needs to simmer. We only now put in the onions and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut your hole, or I\u2019ll shove a spit up your ass and we\u2019ll baste you for a turn or two. I said broth and I said now.\u201d\nHissing, Biter grabbed a handful of half-charred rabbit right off the spit, and tore into it with his pointed teeth while honey dripped between his fingers.\nThe cook was beaten. \u201cTake your bloody broth, then, but if the goat asks why it tastes so thin, you tell him.\u201d\nBiter licked the grease and honey off his fingers as Jaqen Hghar donned a pair of heavy padded mitts. He gave a second pair to Arya. \u201cA weasel will help.\u201d The broth was boiling hot, and the kettles were heavy. Arya and Jaqen wrestled one between them, Rorge carried one by himself, and Biter grabbed two more, hissing in pain when the handles burned his hands. Even so, he did not drop them. They lugged the kettles out of the kitchens and across the ward. Two guards had been posted at the door of the Widow\u2019s Tower. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d one said to Rorge.\n\u201cA pot of boiling piss, want some?\u201d\nJaqen smiled disarmingly. \u201cA prisoner must eat too.\u201d\n\u201cNo one said nothing about\u2014\u201d\nArya cut him off. \u201cIt\u2019s for them, not you.\u201d\nThe second guard waved them past. \u201cBring it down, then.\u201d\nInside the door a winding stair led down to the dungeons. Rorge led the way, with Jaqen and Arya bringing up the rear. \u201cA girl will stay out of the way,\u201d he told her.\nThe steps opened onto a dank stone vault, long, gloomy, and windowless. A few torches burned in sconces at the near end where a group of Ser Amory\u2019s guards sat around a scarred wooden table, talking and playing at tiles. Heavy iron bars separated them from where the captives were crowded together in the dark. The smell of the broth brought many up to the bars.\nArya counted eight guards. They smelled the broth as well. \u201cThere\u2019s the ugliest serving wench I ever saw,\u201d their captain said to Rorge. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the kettle?\u201d\n\u201cYour cock and balls. You want to eat or not?\u201d\nOne of the guards had been pacing, one standing near the bars, a third sitting on the floor with his back to the wall, but the prospect of food drew all of them to the table.\n\u201cAbout bloody time they fed us.\u201d\n\u201cThat onions I smell?\u201d\n\u201cSo where\u2019s the bread?\u201d\n\u201cFuck, we need bowls, cups, spoons\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d Rorge heaved the scalding hot broth across the table, full in their faces. Jaqen H\u2019ghar did the same. Biter threw his kettles too, swinging them underarm so they spun across the dungeon, raining soup. One caught the captain in the temple as he tried to rise. He went down like a sack of sand and lay still. The rest were screaming in agony, praying, or trying to crawl off.\nArya pressed back against the wall as Rorge began to cut throats. Biter preferred to grab the men behind the head and under the chin and crack their necks with a single twist of his huge pale hands. Only one of the guards managed to get a blade out. Jaqen danced away from his slash, drew his own sword, drove the man back into a corner with a flurry of blows, and killed him with a thrust to the heart. The Lorathi brought the blade to Arya still red with heart\u2019s blood and wiped it clean on the front of her shift. \u201cA girl should be bloody too. This is her work.\u201d\nThe key to the cell hung from a hook on the wall above the table. Rorge took it down and opened the door. The first man through was the lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat. \u201cWell done,\u201d he said. \u201cI am Robett Glover.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d Jaqen gave him a bow.\nOnce freed, the captives stripped the dead guards of their weapons and darted up the steps with steel in hand. Their fellows crowded after them, bare-handed. They went swiftly, and with scarcely a word. None of them seemed quite so badly wounded as they had when Vargo Hoat had marched them through the gates of Harrenhal. \u201cThis of the soup, that was clever,\u201d the man Glover was saying. \u201cI did not expect that. Was it Lord Hoat\u2019s idea?\u201d\nRorge began to laugh. He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole where his nose had been. Biter sat on top of one of the dead men, holding a limp hand as he gnawed at the fingers. Bones cracked between his teeth.\n\u201cWho are you men?\u201d A crease appeared between Robett Glover\u2019s brows. \u201cYou were not with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton\u2019s encampment. Are you of the Brave Companions?\u201d\nRorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand. \u201cWe are now.\u201d\n\u201cThis man has the honor to be Jaqen H\u2019ghar, once of the Free City of Lorath. This man\u2019s discourteous companions are named Rorge and Biter. A lord will know which is Biter.\u201d He waved a hand toward Arya. \u201cAnd here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Weasel,\u201d she blurted, before he could tell who she really was. She did not want her name said here, where Rorge might hear, and Biter, and all these others she did not know.\nShe saw Glover dismiss her. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make an end to this bloody business.\u201d\nWhen they climbed back up the winding stair, they found the door guards lying in pools of their own blood. Northmen were running across the ward. Arya heard shouts. The door of Barracks Hall burst open and a wounded man staggered out screaming. Three others ran after him and silenced him with spear and sword. There was fighting around the gatehouse as well. Rorge and Biter rushed off with Glover, but Jaqen H\u2019ghar knelt beside Arya. \u201cA girl does not understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes I do,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t, not truly.\nThe Lorathi must have seen it on her face. \u201cA goat has no loyalty. Soon a wolf banner is raised here, I think. But first a man would hear a certain name unsaid.\u201d\n\u201cI take back the name.\u201d Arya chewed her lip. \u201cDo I still have a third death?\u201d\n\u201cA girl is greedy.\u201d Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed her his bloody fingers. \u201cHere is three and there is four and eight more lie dead below. The debt is paid.\u201d\n\u201cThe debt is paid,\u201d Arya agreed reluctantly. She felt a little sad. Now she was just a mouse again.\n\u201cA god has his due. And now a man must die.\u201d A strange smile touched the lips of Jaqen H\u2019ghar.\n\u201cDie?\u201d she said, confused. What did he mean? \u201cBut I unsaid the name. You don\u2019t need to die now.\u201d\n\u201cI do. My time is done.\u201d Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin, and where it went he changed. His cheeks grew fuller, his eyes closer; his nose hooked, a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.\nArya\u2019s mouth hung open. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she whispered, too astonished to be afraid. \u201cHow did you do that? Was it hard?\u201d\nHe grinned, revealing a shiny gold tooth. \u201cNo harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.\u201d\n\u201cShow me,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI want to do it too.\u201d\n\u201cIf you would learn, you must come with me.\u201d\nArya grew hesitant. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cFar and away, across the narrow sea.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I have to go home. To Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cThen we must part,\u201d he said, \u201cfor I have duties too.\u201d He lifted her hand and pressed a small coin into her palm. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cA coin of great value.\u201d\nArya bit it. It was so hard it could only be iron. \u201cIs it worth enough to buy a horse?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not meant for the buying of horses.\u201d\n\u201cThen what good is it?\u201d\n\u201cAs well ask what good is life, what good is death? If the day comes when you would find me again, give that coin to any man from Braavos, and say these words to him\u2014valar morghulis.\u201d\n\u201cValar morghulis,\u201d Arya repeated. It wasn\u2019t hard. Her fingers closed tight over the coin. Across the yard, she could hear men dying. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go, Jaqen.\u201d\n\u201cJaqen is as dead as Arry,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cand I have promises to keep. Valar morghulis, Arya Stark. Say it again.\u201d\n\u201cValar morghulis,\u201d she said once more, and the stranger in Jaqen\u2019s clothes bowed to her and stalked off through the darkness, cloak swirling. She was alone with the dead men. They deserved to die, Arya told herself, remembering all those Ser Amory Lorch had killed at the holdfast by the lake.\nThe cellars under Kingspyre were empty when she returned to her bed of straw. She whispered her names to her pillow, and when she was done she added, \u201cValar morghulis,\u201d in a small soft voice, wondering what it meant.\nCome dawn, Pinkeye and the others were back, all but one boy who\u2019d been killed in the fighting for no reason that anyone could say. Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood by light of day, complaining all the while that his old bones could not abide steps. When he returned, he told them that Harrenhal had been taken. \u201cThem Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amory\u2019s lot in their beds, and the rest at table after they were good and drunk. The new lord will be here before the day\u2019s out, with his whole host. He\u2019s from the wild north up where that Wall is, and they say he\u2019s a hard one. This lord or that lord, there\u2019s still work to be done. Any foolery and I\u2019ll whip the skin off your back.\u201d He looked at Arya when he said that, but never said a word to her about where she had been the night before.\nAll morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag the corpses to the Flowstone Yard, where a pyre was laid to dispose of them. Shagwell the Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging them by the hair and making them talk. \u201cWhat did you die of?\u201d one head asked. \u201cHot weasel soup,\u201d replied the second.\nArya was set to mopping up dried blood. No one said a word to her beyond the usual, but every so often she would notice people looking at her strangely. Robett Glover and the other men they\u2019d freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon, and then Shagwell and his stupid talking heads started in about the weasel soup. She would have told him to shut up, but she was scared to. The fool was half-mad, and she\u2019d heard that he\u2019d once killed a man for not laughing at one of his japes. He better shut his mouth or I\u2019ll put him on my list with the rest, she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain. It was almost evenfall when the new master of Harrenhal arrived. He had a plain face, beardless and ordinary, notable only for his queer pale eyes. Neither plump, thin, nor muscular, he wore black ringmail and a spotted pink cloak. The sigil on his banner looked like a man dipped in blood. \u201cOn your knees for the Lord of the Dreadfort!\u201d shouted his squire, a boy no older than Arya, and Harrenhal knelt.\nVargo Hoat came forward. \u201cMy lord, Harrenhal ith yourth.\u201d\nThe lord gave answer, but too softly for Arya to hear. Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey, freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks, came up to join them. After some brief talk, Ser Aenys led them over to Rorge and Biter. Arya was surprised to see them still here; somehow she would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did. Arya heard the harsh sound of Rorge\u2019s voice, but not what he was saying. Then Shagwell pounced on her, dragging her out across the yard. \u201cMy lord, my lord,\u201d he sang, tugging at her wrist, \u201chere\u2019s the weasel who made the soup!\u201d\n\u201cLet go,\u201d Arya said, wriggling out of his grasp.\nThe lord regarded her. Only his eyes moved; they were very pale, the color of ice. \u201cHow old are you, child?\u201d\nShe had to think for a moment to remember. \u201cTen.\u201d\n\u201cTen, my lord,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAre you fond of animals?\u201d\n\u201cSome kinds. My lord.\u201d\nA thin smile twitched across his lips. \u201cBut not lions, it would seem. Nor manticores.\u201d\nShe did not know what to say to that, so she said nothing.\n\u201cThey tell me you are called Weasel. That will not serve. What name did your mother give you?\u201d\nShe bit her lip, groping for another name. Lommy had called her Lumpyhead, Sansa used Horseface, and her father\u2019s men once dubbed her Arya Underfoot, but she did not think any of those were the sort of name he wanted.\n\u201cNymeria,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly she called me Nan for short.\u201d\n\u201cYou will call me my lord when you speak to me, Nan,\u201d the lord said mildly. \u201cYou are too young to be a Brave Companion, I think, and of the wrong sex. Are you afraid of leeches, child?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re only leeches. My lord.\u201d\n\u201cMy squire could take a lesson from you, it would seem. Frequent leechings are the secret of a long life. A man must purge himself of bad blood. You will do, I think. For so long as I remain at Harrenhal, Nan, you shall be my cupbearer, and serve me at table and in chambers.\u201d\nThis time she knew better than to say that she\u2019d sooner work in the stables. \u201cYes, your lord. I mean, my lord.\u201d\nThe lord waved a hand. \u201cMake her presentable,\u201d he said to no one in particular, \u201cand make certain she knows how to pour wine without spilling it.\u201d Turning away, he lifted a hand and said, \u201cLord Hoat, see to those banners above the gatehouse.\u201d\nFour Brave Companions climbed to the ramparts and hauled down the lion of Lannister and Ser Amory\u2019s own black manticore. In their place they raised the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark. And that evening, a page named Nan poured wine for Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat as they stood on the gallery, watching the Brave Companions parade Ser Amory Lorch naked through the middle ward. Ser Amory pleaded and sobbed and clung to the legs of his captors, until Rorge pulled him loose, and Shagwell kicked him down into the bear pit.\nThe bear is all in black, Arya thought. Like Yoren. She filled Roose Bolton\u2019s cup, and did not spill a drop.",

      "content": "Daenerys\nIn this city of splendors, Dany had expected the House of the Undying Ones to be the most splendid of all, but she emerged from her palanquin to behold a grey and ancient ruin.\nLong and low, without towers or windows, it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening. No other buildings stood near. Black tiles covered the palace roof, many fallen or broken; the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling. She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust. Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of it. The black dragon hissed, smoke seeping out between his sharp teeth.\n\u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d Jhogo said in Dothraki, \u201cthis is an evil place, a haunt of ghosts and maegi. See how it drinks the morning sun? Let us go before it drinks us as well.\u201d\nSer Jorah Mormont came up beside them. \u201cWhat power can they have if they live in that?\u201d\n\u201cHeed the wisdom of those who love you best,\u201d said Xaro Xhoan Daxos, lounging inside the palanquin. \u201cWarlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows. They will give you naught. They have naught to give.\u201d\nAggo put a hand on his arakh. \u201cKhaleesi, it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust, but few come out.\u201d\n\u201cIt is said,\u201d Jhogo agreed.\n\u201cWe are blood of your blood,\u201d said Aggo, \u201csworn to live and die as you do. Let us walk with you in this dark place, to keep you safe from harm.\u201d\n\u201cSome places even a khal must walk alone,\u201d Dany said.\n\u201cTake me, then,\u201d Ser Jorah urged. \u201cThe risk\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQueen Daenerys must enter alone, or not at all.\u201d The warlock Pyat Pree stepped out from under the trees. Has he been there all along? Dany wondered. \u201cShould she turn away now, the doors of wisdom shall be closed to her forevermore.\u201d\n\u201cMy pleasure barge awaits, even now,\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos called out. \u201cTurn away from this folly, most stubborn of queens. I have flutists who will soothe your troubled soul with sweet music, and a small girl whose tongue will make you sigh and melt.\u201d\nSer Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look. \u201cYour Grace, remember Mirri Maz Duur.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Dany said, suddenly decided. \u201cI remember that she had knowledge. And she was only a maegi.\u201d\nPyat Pree smiled thinly. \u201cThe child speaks as sagely as a crone. Take my arm, and let me lead you.\u201d\n\u201cI am no child.\u201d Dany took his arm nonetheless.\nIt was darker than she would have thought under the black trees, and the way was longer. Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace, Pyat Pree soon turned aside. When she questioned him, the warlock said only, \u201cThe front way leads in, but never out again. Heed my words, my queen. The House of the Undying Ones was not made for mortal men. If you value your soul, take care and do just as I tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI will do as you say,\u201d Dany promised.\n\u201cWhen you enter, you will find yourself in a room with four doors: the one you have come through and three others. Take the door to your right. Each time, the door to your right. If you should come upon a stairwell, climb. Never go down, and never take any door but the first door to your right.\u201d\n\u201cThe door to my right,\u201d Dany repeated. \u201cI understand. And when I leave, the opposite?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means,\u201d Pyat Pree said. \u201cLeaving and coming, it is the same. Always up. Always the door to your right. Other doors may open to you. Within, you will see many things that disturb you. Visions of loveliness and visions of horror, wonders and terrors. Sights and sounds of days gone by and days to come and days that never were. Dwellers and servitors may speak to you as you go. Answer or ignore them as you choose, but enter no room until you reach the audience chamber.\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you come to the chamber of the Undying, be patient. Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth\u2019s wing to them. Listen well, and write each word upon your heart.\u201d\nWhen they reached the door\u2014a tall oval mouth, set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face\u2014the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold. He stood no higher than her knee, his faced pinched and pointed, snoutish, but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue, and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray. Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid: shade of the evening, the wine of warlocks. \u201cTake and drink,\u201d urged Pyat Pree.\n\u201cWill it turn my lips blue?\u201d\n\u201cOne flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes, so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you.\u201d\nDany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother\u2019s milk and Drogo\u2019s seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them\u2026 and then the glass was empty.\n\u201cNow you may enter,\u201d said the warlock. Dany put the glass back on the servitor\u2019s tray, and went inside.\nShe found herself in a stone anteroom with four doors, one on each wall. With never a hesitation, she went to the door on her right and stepped through. The second room was a twin to the first. Again she turned to the right-hand door. When she pushed it open she faced yet another small antechamber with four doors. I am in the presence of sorcery.\nThe fourth room was oval rather than square and walled in worm-eaten wood in place of stone. Six passages led out from it in place of four. Dany chose the rightmost, and entered a long, dim, high-ceilinged hall. Along the right hand was a row of torches burning with a smoky orange light, but the only doors were to her left. Drogon unfolded wide black wings and beat the stale air. He flew twenty feet before thudding to an undignified crash. Dany strode after him.\nThe mold-eaten carpet under her feet had once been gorgeously colored, and whorls of gold could still be seen in the fabric, glinting broken amidst the faded grey and mottled green. What remained served to muffle her footfalls, but that was not all to the good. Dany could hear sounds within the walls, a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats. Drogon heard them too. His head moved as he followed the sounds, and when they stopped he gave an angry scream. Other sounds, even more disturbing, came through some of the closed doors. One shook and thumped, as if someone were trying to break through. From another came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side. Dany hurried quickly past.\nNot all the doors were closed. I will not look, Dany told herself, but the temptation was too strong.\nIn one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her. They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth, tearing and chewing.\nFarther on she came upon a feast of corpses. Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Severed hands clutched bloody cups, wooden spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.\nShe fled from him, but only as far as the next open door. I know this room, she thought. She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them. And there outside the window, a lemon tree! The sight of it made her heart ache with longing. It is the house with the red door, the house in Braavos. No sooner had she thought it than old Ser Willem came into the room, leaning heavily on his stick. \u201cLittle princess, there you are,\u201d he said in his gruff kind voice. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201ccome to me, my lady, you\u2019re home now, you\u2019re safe now.\u201d His big wrinkled hand reached for her, soft as old leather, and Dany wanted to take it and hold it and kiss it, she wanted that as much as she had ever wanted anything. Her foot edged forward, and then she thought, He\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead, the sweet old bear, he died a long time ago. She backed away and ran.\nThe long hall went on and on and on, with endless doors to her left and only torches to her right. She ran past more doors than she could count, closed doors and open ones, doors of wood and doors of iron, carved doors and plain ones, doors with pulls and doors with locks and doors with knockers. Drogon lashed against her back, urging her on, and Dany ran until she could run no more.\nFinally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left, grander than the rest. They swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look. Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall, the largest she had ever seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls. Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair. \u201cLet him be king over charred bones and cooked meat,\u201d he said to a man below him. \u201cLet him be the king of ashes.\u201d Drogon shrieked, his claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and Dany moved on.\nViserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother\u2019s hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. \u201cAegon,\u201d he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. \u201cWhat better name for a king?\u201d\n\u201cWill you make a song for him?\u201d the woman asked.\n\u201cHe has a song,\u201d the man replied. \u201cHe is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.\u201d He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany\u2019s, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. \u201cThere must be one more,\u201d he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. \u201cThe dragon has three heads.\u201d He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.\nIt seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a steep stone stair, descending into darkness. Every door, open or closed, had been to her left. Dany looked back behind her. The torches were going out, she realized with a start of fear. Perhaps twenty still burned. Thirty at most. One more guttered out even as she watched, and the darkness came a little farther down the hall, creeping toward her. And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming, shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the faded carpet. Terror filled her. She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here, but how could she go on? There was no door on her right, and the steps went down, not up.\nYet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. Drogon\u2019s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right\u2026\nIt came to her suddenly\u2026 is the last door on the left!\nShe flung herself through. Beyond was another small room with four doors. To the right she went, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, until she was dizzy and out of breath once more.\nWhen she stopped, she found herself in yet another dank stone chamber\u2026 but this time the door opposite was round, shaped like an open mouth, and Pyat Pree stood outside in the grass beneath the trees. \u201cCan it be that the Undying are done with you so soon?\u201d he asked in disbelief when he saw her.\n\u201cSo soon?\u201d she said, confused. \u201cI\u2019ve walked for hours, and still not found them.\u201d\n\u201cYou have taken a wrong turning. Come, I will lead you.\u201d Pyat Pree held out his hand.\nDany hesitated. There was a door to her right, still closed\u2026\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way,\u201d Pyat Pree said firmly, his blue lips prim with disapproval. \u201cThe Undying Ones will not wait forever.\u201d\n\u201cOur little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth\u2019s wing to them,\u201d Dany said, remembering.\n\u201cStubborn child. You will be lost, and never found.\u201d\nShe walked away from him, to the door on the right.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Pyat screeched. \u201cNo, to me, come to me, to meeeeeee.\u201d His face crumbled inward, changing to something pale and wormlike.\nDany left him behind, entering a stairwell. She began to climb. Before long her legs were aching. She recalled that the House of the Undying Ones had seemed to have no towers.\nFinally the stair opened. To her right, a set of wide wooden doors had been thrown open. They were fashioned of ebony and weirwood, the black and white grains swirling and twisting in strange interwoven patterns. They were very beautiful, yet somehow frightening. The blood of the dragon must not be afraid. Dany said a quick prayer, begging the Warrior for courage and the Dothraki horse god for strength. She made herself walk forward.\nBeyond the doors was a great hall and a splendor of wizards. Some wore sumptuous robes of ermine, ruby velvet, and cloth of gold. Others fancied elaborate armor studded with gemstones, or tall pointed hats speckled with stars. There were women among them, dressed in gowns of surpassing loveliness. Shafts of sunlight slanted through windows of stained glass, and the air was alive with the most beautiful music she had ever heard.\nA kingly man in rich robes rose when he saw her, and smiled. \u201cDaenerys of House Targaryen, be welcome. Come and share the food of forever. We are the Undying of Qarth.\u201d\n\u201cLong have we awaited you,\u201d said a woman beside him, clad in rose and silver. The breast she had left bare in the Qartheen fashion was as perfect as a breast could be.\n\u201cWe knew you were to come to us,\u201d the wizard king said. \u201cA thousand years ago we knew, and have been waiting all this time. We sent the comet to show you the way.\u201d\n\u201cWe have knowledge to share with you,\u201d said a warrior in shining emerald armor, \u201cand magic weapons to arm you with. You have passed every trial. Now come and sit with us, and all your questions shall be answered.\u201d\nShe took a step forward. But then Drogon leapt from her shoulder. He flew to the top of the ebony-and-weirwood door, perched there, and began to bite at the carved wood.\n\u201cA willful beast,\u201d laughed a handsome young man. \u201cShall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind? Come, come.\u201d\nDoubt seized her. The great door was so heavy it took all of Dany\u2019s strength to budge it, but finally it began to move. Behind was another door, hidden. It was old grey wood, splintery and plain\u2026 but it stood to the right of the door through which she\u2019d entered. The wizards were beckoning her with voices sweeter than song. She ran from them, Drogon flying back down to her. Through the narrow door she passed, into a chamber awash in gloom.\nA long stone table filled this room. Above it floated a human heart, swollen and blue with corruption, yet still alive. It beat, a deep ponderous throb of sound, and each pulse sent out a wash of indigo light. The figures around the table were no more than blue shadows. As Dany walked to the empty chair at the foot of the table, they did not stir, nor speak, nor turn to face her. There was no sound but the slow, deep beat of the rotting heart.\n\u2026mother of dragons\u2026 came a voice, part whisper and part moan\u2026 dragons\u2026 dragons\u2026 dragons\u2026 other voices echoed in the gloom. Some were male and some female. One spoke with the timbre of a child. The floating heart pulsed from dimness to darkness. It was hard to summon the will to speak, to recall the words she had practiced so assiduously. \u201cI am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.\u201d Do they hear me? Why don\u2019t they move? She sat, folding her hands in her lap. \u201cGrant me your counsel, and speak to me with the wisdom of those who have conquered death.\u201d\nThrough the indigo murk, she could make out the wizened features of the Undying One to her right, an old old man, wrinkled and hairless. His flesh was a ripe violet-blue, his lips and nails bluer still, so dark they were almost black. Even the whites of his eyes were blue. They stared unseeing at the ancient woman on the opposite side of the table, whose gown of pale silk had rotted on her body. One withered breast was left bare in the Qartheen manner, to show a pointed blue nipple hard as leather.\nShe is not breathing. Dany listened to the silence. None of them are breathing, and they do not move, and those eyes see nothing. Could it be that the Undying Ones were dead?\nHer answer was a whisper as thin as a mouse\u2019s whisker\u2026 we live\u2026 live\u2026 live\u2026 it sounded. Myriad other voices whispered echoes\u2026 And know\u2026 know\u2026 know\u2026 know\u2026\n\u201cI have come for the gift of truth,\u201d Dany said. \u201cIn the long hall, the things I saw\u2026 were they true visions, or lies? Past things, or things to come? What did they mean?\u201d\n\u2026the shape of shadows\u2026 morrows not yet made\u2026 drink from the cup of ice\u2026 drink from the cup of fire\u2026\n\u2026mother of dragons\u2026 child of three\u2026\n\u201cThree?\u201d She did not understand.\n\u2026three heads has the dragon\u2026 the ghost chorus yarnmered inside her skull with never a lip moving, never a breath stirring the still blue air\u2026 mother of dragons\u2026 child of storm\u2026 The whispers became a swirling song\u2026 three fires must you light\u2026 one for life and one for death and one to love\u2026 Her own heart was beating in unison to the one that floated before her, blue and corrupt\u2026 three mounts must you ride\u2026 one to bed and one to dread and one to love\u2026 The voices were growing louder, she realized, and it seemed her heart was slowing, and even her breath\u2026 three treasons will you know\u2026 once for blood and once for gold and once for love\u2026\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Her voice was no more than a whisper, almost as faint as theirs. What was happening to her? \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, more loudly. Why was it so hard to talk here? \u201cHelp me. Show me.\u201d\n\u2026help her\u2026 the whispers mocked\u2026 show her\u2026\nThen phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman\u2019s name\u2026 mother of dragons, daughter of death\u2026 Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire\u2026 mother of dragons, slayer of lies\u2026 Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness\u2026 mother of dragons, bride of fire\u2026\nFaster and faster the visions came, one after the other, until it seemed as if the very air had come alive. Shadows whirled and danced inside a tent, boneless and terrible. A little girl ran barefoot toward a big house with a red door. Mirri Maz Duur shrieked in the flames, a dragon bursting from her brow. Behind a silver horse the bloody corpse of a naked man bounced and dragged. A white lion ran through grass taller than a man. Beneath the Mother of Mountains, a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before her, their grey heads bowed. Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on her silver, riding like the wind. \u201cMother!\u201d they cried. \u201cMother, mother!\u201d They were reaching for her, touching her, tugging at her cloak, the hem of her skirt, her foot, her leg, her breast. They wanted her, needed her, the fire, the life, and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them\u2026\nBut then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the indigo air, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. The Undying were all around her, blue and cold, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their dry cold hands, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. Even her heart had ceased to beat. She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting\u2026\nThen indigo turned to orange, and whispers turned to screams. Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons, and when his head snapped forward, fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. Their flesh was crumbling parchment, their bones dry wood soaked in tallow. They danced as the flames consumed them; they staggered and writhed and spun and raised blazing hands on high, their fingers bright as torches.\nDany pushed herself to her feet and bulled through them. They were light as air, no more than husks, and they fell at a touch. The whole room was ablaze by the time she reached the door. \u201cDrogon,\u201d she called, and he flew to her through the fire.\nOutside a long dim passageway stretched serpentine before her, lit by the flickering orange glare from behind. Dany ran, searching for a door, a door to her right, a door to her left, any door, but there was nothing, only twisty stone walls, and a floor that seemed to move slowly under her feet, writhing as if to trip her. She kept her feet and ran faster, and suddenly the door was there ahead of her, a door like an open mouth.\nWhen she spilled out into the sun, the bright light made her stumble. Pyat Pree was gibbering in some unknown tongue and hopping from one foot to the other. When Dany looked behind her, she saw thin tendrils of smoke forcing their way through cracks in the ancient stone walls of the Palace of Dust, and rising from between the black tiles of the roof.\nHowling curses, Pyat Pree drew a knife and danced toward her, but Drogon flew at his face. Then she heard the crack of Jhogo\u2019s whip, and never was a sound so sweet. The knife went flying, and an instant later Rakharo was slamming Pyat to the ground. Ser Jorah Mormont knelt beside Dany in the cool green grass and put his arm around her shoulder.",

      "content": "Tyrion\n\u201cIf you die stupidly, I\u2019m going to feed your body to the goats,\u201d Tyrion threatened as the first load of Stone Crows pushed off from the quay.\nShagga laughed. \u201cThe Halfman has no goats.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get some just for you.\u201d\nDawn was breaking, and pale ripples of light shimmered on the surface of the river, shattering under the poles and reforming when the ferry had passed. Timett had taken his Burned Men into the kingswood two days before. Yesterday the Black Ears and Moon Brothers followed, today the Stone Crows.\n\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t try and fight a battle,\u201d Tyrion said. \u201cStrike at their camps and baggage train. Ambush their scouts and hang the bodies from trees ahead of their line of march, loop around and cut down stragglers. I want night attacks, so many and so sudden that they\u2019ll be afraid to sleep\u2014\u201d\nShagga laid a hand atop Tyrion\u2019s head. \u201cAll this I learned from Dolf son of Holger before my beard had grown. This is the way of war in the Mountains of the Moon.\u201d\n\u201cThe kingswood is not the Mountains of the Moon, and you won\u2019t be fighting Milk Snakes and Painted Dogs. And listen to the guides I\u2019m sending, they know this wood as well as you know your mountains. Heed their counsel and they\u2019ll serve you well.\u201d\n\u201cShagga will listen to the Halfman\u2019s pets,\u201d the clansman promised solemnly. And then it was time for him to lead his garron onto the ferry. Tyrion watched them push off and pole out toward the center of the Blackwater. He felt a queer twinge in the pit of his stomach as Shagga faded in the morning mist. He was going to feel naked without his clansmen.\nHe still had Bronn\u2019s hirelings, near eight hundred of them now, but sellswords were notoriously fickle. Tyrion had done what he could to buy their continued loyalty, promising Bronn and a dozen of his best men lands and knighthoods when the battle was won. They\u2019d drunk his wine, laughed at his jests, and called each other ser until they were all staggering\u2026 all but Bronn himself, who\u2019d only smiled that insolent dark smile of his and afterward said, \u201cThey\u2019ll kill for that knighthood, but don\u2019t ever think they\u2019ll die for it.\u201d\nTyrion had no such delusion.\nThe gold cloaks were almost as uncertain a weapon. Six thousand men in the City Watch, thanks to Cersei, but only a quarter of them could be relied upon. \u201cThere\u2019s few out-and-out traitors, though there\u2019s some, even your spider hasn\u2019t found them all,\u201d Bywater had warned him. \u201cBut there\u2019s hundreds greener than spring grass, men who joined for bread and ale and safety. No man likes to look craven in the sight of his fellows, so they\u2019ll fight brave enough at the start, when it\u2019s all warhorns and blowing banners. But if the battle looks to be going sour they\u2019ll break, and they\u2019ll break bad. The first man to throw down his spear and run will have a thousand more trodding on his heels.\u201d\nTo be sure, there were seasoned men in the City Watch, the core of two thousand who\u2019d gotten their gold cloaks from Robert, not Cersei. Yet even those\u2026 a watchman was not truly a soldier, Lord Tywin Lannister had been fond of saying. Of knights and squires and men-at-arms, Tyrion had no more than three hundred. Soon enough, he must test the truth of another of his father\u2019s sayings: One man on a wall was worth ten beneath it.\nBronn and the escort were waiting at the foot of the quay, amidst swarming beggars, strolling whores, and fishwives crying the catch. The fishwives did more business than all the rest combined. Buyers flocked around the barrels and stalls to haggle over winkles, clams, and river pike. With no other food coming into the city, the price of fish was ten times what it had been before the war, and still rising. Those who had coin came to the riverfront each morning and each evening, in hopes of bringing home an eel or a pot of red crabs; those who did not slipped between the stalls hoping to steal, or stood gaunt and forlorn beneath the walls.\nThe gold cloaks cleared a path through the press, shoving people aside with the shafts of their spears. Tyrion ignored the muttered curses as best he could. A fish came sailing out of the crowd, slimy and rotten. It landed at his feet and flew to pieces. He stepped over it gingerly and climbed into his saddle. Children with swollen bellies were already fighting over pieces of the stinking fish.\nMounted, he gazed along the riverfront. Hammers rang in the morning air as carpenters swarmed over the Mud Gate, extending wooden hoardings from the battlements. Those were coming well. He was a deal less pleased by the clutter of ramshackle structures that had been allowed to grow up behind the quays, attaching themselves to the city walls like barnacles on the hull of a ship; bait shacks and pot-shops, warehouses, merchants\u2019 stalls, alehouses, the cribs where the cheaper sort of whores spread their legs. It has to go, every bit of it. As it was, Stannis would hardly need scaling ladders to storm the walls.\nHe called Bronn to his side. \u201cAssemble a hundred men and burn everything you see here between the water\u2019s edge and the city walls.\u201d He waved his stubby fingers, taking in all the waterfront squalor. \u201cI want nothing left standing, do you understand?\u201d\nThe black-haired sellsword turned his head, considering the task. \u201cThem as own all this won\u2019t like that much.\u201d\n\u201cI never imagined they would. So be it; they\u2019ll have something else to curse the evil monkey demon for.\u201d\n\u201cSome may fight.\u201d\n\u201cSee that they lose.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do with those that live here?\u201d\n\u201cLet them have a reasonable time to remove their property, and then move them out. Try not to kill any of them, they\u2019re not the enemy. And no more rapes! Keep your men in line, damn it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re sellswords, not septons,\u201d said Bronn. \u201cNext you\u2019ll be telling me you want them sober.\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nTyrion only wished he could as easily make city walls twice as tall and three times as thick. Though perhaps it did not matter. Massive walls and tall towers had not saved Storm\u2019s End, nor Harrenhal, nor even Winterfell.\nHe remembered Winterfell as he had last seen it. Not as grotesquely huge as Harrenhal, nor as solid and impregnable to look at as Storm\u2019s End, yet there had been a great strength in those stones, a sense that within those walls a man might feel safe. The news of the castle\u2019s fall had come as a wrenching shock. \u201cThe gods give with one hand and take with the other,\u201d he muttered under his breath when Varys told him. They had given the Starks Harrenhal and taken Winterfell, a dismal exchange.\nNo doubt he should be rejoicing. Robb Stark would have to turn north now. If he could not defend his own home and hearth, he was no sort of king at all. It meant reprieve for the west, for House Lannister, and yet\u2026\nTyrion had only the vaguest memory of Theon Greyjoy from his time with the Starks. A callow youth, always smiling, skilled with a bow; it was hard to imagine him as Lord of Winterfell. The Lord of Winterfell would always be a Stark.\nHe remembered their godswood; the tall sentinels armored in their grey-green needles, the great oaks, the hawthorn and ash and soldier pines, and at the center the heart tree standing like some pale giant frozen in time. He could almost smell the place, earthy and brooding, the smell of centuries, and he remembered how dark the wood had been even by day. That wood was Winterfell. It was the north. I never felt so out of place as I did when I walked there, so much an unwelcome intruder. He wondered if the Greyjoys would feel it too. The castle might well be theirs, but never that godswood. Not in a year, or ten, or fifty.\nTyrion Lannister walked his horse slowly toward the Mud Gate. Winterfell is nothing to you, he reminded himself. Be glad the place has fallen, and look to your own walls. The gate was open. Inside, three great trebuchets stood side by side in the market square, peering over the battlements like three huge birds. Their throwing arms were made from the trunks of old oaks, and banded with iron to keep them from splitting. The gold cloaks had named them the Three Whores, because they\u2019d be giving Lord Stannis such a lusty welcome. Or so we hope.\nTyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted through the Mud Gate, breasting the human tide. Once beyond the Whores, the press grew thinner and the street opened up around him.\nThe ride back to the Red Keep was uneventful, but at the Tower of the Hand he found a dozen angry trader captains waiting in his audience chamber to protest the seizure of their ships. He gave them a sincere apology and promised compensation once the war was done. That did little to appease them. \u201cWhat if you should lose, my lord?\u201d one Braavosi asked.\n\u201cThen apply to King Stannis for your compensation.\u201d\nBy the time he rid himself of them, bells were ringing and Tyrion knew he would be late for the installation. He waddled across the yard almost at a run and crowded into the back of the castle sept as Joffrey fastened white silk cloaks about the shoulders of the two newest members of his Kingsguard. The rite seemed to require that everyone stand, so Tyrion saw nothing but a wall of courtly arses. On the other hand, once the new High Septon was finished leading the two knights through their solemn vows and anointing them in the names of the Seven, he would be well positioned to be first out the doors.\nHe approved of his sister\u2019s choice of Ser Balon Swann to take the place of the slain Preston Greenfield. The Swanns were Marcher lords, proud, powerful, and cautious. Pleading illness, Lord Gulian Swann had remained in his castle, taking no part in the war, but his eldest son had ridden with Renly and now Stannis, while Balon, the younger, served at King\u2019s Landing. If he\u2019d had a third son, Tyrion suspected he\u2019d be off with Robb Stark. It was not perhaps the most honorable course, but it showed good sense; whoever won the iron Throne, the Swanns intended to survive. In addition to being well born, young Ser Balon was valiant, courtly, and skilled at arms; good with a lance, better with a morningstar, superb with the bow. He would serve with honor and courage.\nAlas, Tyrion could not say the same for Cersei\u2019s second choice. Ser Osmund Kettleblack looked formidable enough. He stood six feet and six inches, most of it sinew and muscle, and his hook nose, bushy eyebrows, and spade-shaped brown beard gave his face a fierce aspect, so long as he did not smile. Lowborn, no more than a hedge knight, Kettleblack was utterly dependent on Cersei for his advancement, which was doubtless why she\u2019d picked him. \u201cSer Osmund is as loyal as he is brave,\u201d she\u2019d told Joffrey when she put forward his name. It was true, unfortunately. The good Ser Osmund had been selling her secrets to Bronn since the day she\u2019d hired him, but Tyrion could scarcely tell her that.\nHe supposed he ought not complain. The appointment gave him another ear close to the king, unbeknownst to his sister. And even if Ser Osmund proved an utter craven, he would be no worse than Ser Boros Blount, currently residing in a dungeon at Rosby. Ser Boros had been escorting Tommen and Lord Gyles when Ser Jacelyn Bywater and his gold cloaks had surprised them, and had yielded up his charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old Ser Barristan Selmy as much as it did Cersei; a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die in defense of the king and royal family. His sister had insisted that Joffrey strip Blount of his white cloak on the grounds of treason and cowardice. And now she replaces him with another man just as hollow.\nThe praying, vowing, and anointing seemed to take most of the morning. Tyrion\u2019s legs soon began to ache. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, restless. Lady Tanda stood several rows up, he saw, but her daughter was not with her. He had been half hoping to catch a glimpse of Shae. Varys said she was doing well, but he would prefer to see for himself.\n\u201cBetter a lady\u2019s maid than a pot girl,\u201d Shae had said when Tyrion told her the eunuch\u2019s scheme. \u201cCan I take my belt of silver flowers and my gold collar with the black diamonds you said looked like my eyes? I won\u2019t wear them if you say I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nLoath as he was to disappoint her, Tyrion had to point out that while Lady Tanda was by no means a clever woman, even she might wonder if her daughter\u2019s bedmaid seemed to own more jewelry than her daughter. \u201cChoose two or three dresses, no more,\u201d he commanded her. \u201cGood wool, no silk, no samite, and no fur. The rest I\u2019ll keep in my own chambers for when you visit me.\u201d It was not the answer Shae had wanted, but at least she was safe.\nWhen the investiture was finally done Joffrey marched out between Ser Balon and Ser Osmund in their new white cloaks, while Tyrion lingered for a word with the new High Septon (who was his choice, and wise enough to know who put the honey on his bread). \u201cI want the gods on our side,\u201d Tyrion told him bluntly. \u201cTell them that Stannis has vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor.\u201d\n\u201cIs it true, my lord?\u201d asked the High Septon, a small, shrewd man with a wispy white beard and wizened face.\nTyrion shrugged. \u201cIt may be. Stannis burned the godswood at Storm\u2019s End as an offering to the Lord of Light. If he\u2019d offend the old gods, why should he spare the new? Tell them that. Tell them that any man who thinks to give aid to the usurper betrays the gods as well as his rightful king.\u201d\n\u201cI shall, my lord. And I shall command them to pray for the health of the king and his Hand as well.\u201d\nHallyne the Pyromancer was waiting on him when Tyrion returned to his solar, and Maester Frenken had brought messages. He let the alchemist wait a little longer while he read what the ravens had brought him. There was an old letter from Doran Martell, warning him that Storm\u2019s End had fallen, and a much more intriguing one from Balon Greyjoy on Pyke, who styled himself King of the Isles and the North. He invited King Joffrey to send an envoy to the Iron Islands to fix the borders between their realms and discuss a possible alliance.\nTyrion read the letter three times and set it aside. Lord Balon\u2019s longships would have been a great help against the fleet sailing up from Storm\u2019s End, but they were thousands of leagues away on the wrong side of Westeros, and Tyrion was far from certain that he wanted to give away half the realm. Perhaps I should spill this one in Cersei\u2019s lap, or take it to the council.\nOnly then did he admit Hallyne with the latest tallies from the alchemists. \u201cThis cannot be true,\u201d said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers. \u201cAlmost thirteen thousand jars? Do you take me for a fool? I\u2019m not about to pay the king\u2019s gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed with wax, I warn you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Hallyne squeaked, \u201cthe sums are accurate, I swear. We have been, hmmm, most fortunate, my lord Hand. Another cache of Lord Rossart\u2019s was found, more than three hundred jars. Under the Dragonpit! Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook them for wine. He was so drunk he broke the seal and drank some.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a prince who tried that once,\u201d said Tyrion dryly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any dragons rising over the city, so it would seem it didn\u2019t work this time either.\u201d The Dragonpit atop the hill of Rhaenys had been abandoned for a century and a half. He supposed it was as good a place as any to store wildfire, and better than most, but it would have been nice if the late Lord Rossart had told someone. \u201cThree hundred jars, you say? That still does not account for these totals. You are several thousand jars ahead of the best estimate you gave me when last we met.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s so.\u201d Hallyne mopped at his pale brow with the sleeve of his black-and-scarlet robe. \u201cWe have been working very hard, my lord Hand, hmmm.\u201d\n\u201cThat would doubtless explain why you are making so much more of the substance than before.\u201d Smiling, Tyrion fixed the pyromancer with his mismatched stare. \u201cThough it does raise the question of why you did not begin working hard until now.\u201d\nHallyne had the complexion of a mushroom, so it was hard to see how he could turn any paler, yet somehow he managed. \u201cWe were, my lord Hand, my brothers and I have been laboring day and night from the first, I assure you. It is only, hmmm, we have made so much of the substance that we have become, hmmm, more practiced as it were, and also\u201d\u2014the alchemist shifted uncomfortably\u2014\u201ccertain spells, hmmm, ancient secrets of our order, very delicate, very troublesome, but necessary if the substance is to be, hmmm, all it should be\u2026\u201d\nTyrion was growing impatient. Ser Jacelyn Bywater was likely here by now, and Ironhand misliked waiting. \u201cYes, you have secret spells; how splendid. What of them?\u201d\n\u201cThey, hmmm, seem to be working better than they were.\u201d Hallyne smiled weakly. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose there are any dragons about, do you?\u201d\n\u201cNot unless you found one under the Dragonpit. Why?\u201d\n\u201cOh, pardon, I was just remembering something old Wisdom Pollitor told me once, when I was an acolyte. I\u2019d asked him why so many of our spells seemed, well, not as effectual as the scrolls would have us believe, and he said it was because magic had begun to go out of the world the day the last dragon died.\u201d\n\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019ve seen no dragons. I have noticed the King\u2019s Justice lurking about, however. Should any of these fruits you\u2019re selling me turn out to be filled with anything but wildfire, you\u2019ll be seeing him as well.\u201d\nHallyne fled so quickly that he almost bowled over Ser Jacelyn\u2014no, Lord Jacelyn, he must remember that. Ironhand was mercifully direct, as ever. He\u2019d returned from Rosby to deliver a fresh levy of spearmen recruited from Lord Gyles\u2019s estates and resume his command of the City Watch. \u201cHow does my nephew fare?\u201d Tyrion asked when they were done discussing the city\u2019s defenses.\n\u201cPrince Tommen is hale and happy, my lord. He has adopted a fawn some of my men brought home from a hunt. He had one once before, he says, but Joffrey skinned her for a jerkin. He asks about his mother sometimes, and often begins letters to the Princess Myrcella, though he never seems to finish any. His brother, however, he does not seem to miss at all.\u201d\n\u201cYou have made suitable arrangements for him, should the battle be lost?\u201d\n\u201cMy men have their instructions.\u201d\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\n\u201cYou commanded me to tell no one, my lord.\u201d\nThat made him smile. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you remember.\u201d Should King\u2019s Landing fall, he might well be taken alive. Better if he did not know where Joffrey\u2019s heir might be found.\nVarys appeared not long after Lord Jacelyn had left. \u201cMen are such faithless creatures,\u201d he said by way of greeting.\nTyrion sighed. \u201cWho\u2019s the traitor today?\u201d\nThe eunuch handed him a scroll. \u201cSo much villainy, it sings a sad song for our age. Did honor die with our fathers?\u201d\n\u201cMy father is not dead yet.\u201d Tyrion scanned the list. \u201cI know some of these names. These are rich men. Traders, merchants, craftsmen. Why should they conspire against us?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems they believe that Lord Stannis must win, and wish to share his victory. They call themselves the Antler Men, after the crowned stag.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone should tell them that Stannis changed his sigil. Then they can be the Hot Hearts.\u201d It was no matter for jests, though; it appeared that these Antler Men had armed several hundred followers, to seize the Old Gate once battle was joined, and admit the enemy to the city. Among the names on the list was the master armorer Salloreon. \u201cI suppose this means I won\u2019t be getting that terrifying helm with the demon horns,\u201d Tyrion complained as he scrawled the order for the man\u2019s arrest.",

      "content": "Theon\nOne moment he was asleep; the next, awake.\nKyra nestled against him, one arm draped lightly over his, her breasts brushing his back. He could hear her breathing, soft and steady. The sheet was tangled about them. It was the black of night. The bedchamber was dark and still.\nWhat is it? Did I hear something? Someone?\nWind sighed faintly against the shutters. Somewhere, far off, he heard the yowl of a cat in heat. Nothing else. Sleep, Greyjoy, he told himself. The castle is quiet, and you have guards posted. At your door, at the gates, on the armory.\nHe might have put it down to a bad dream, but he did not remember dreaming. Kyra had worn him out. Until Theon had sent for her, she had lived all of her eighteen years in the winter town without ever setting foot inside the walls of the castle. She came to him wet and eager and lithe as a weasel, and there had been a certain undeniable spice to fucking a common tavern wench in Lord Eddard Stark\u2019s own bed.\nShe murmured sleepily as Theon slid out from under her arm and got to his feet. A few embers still smoldered in the hearth. Wex slept on the floor at the foot of the bed, rolled up inside his cloak and dead to the world. Nothing moved. Theon crossed to the window and threw open the shutters. Night touched him with cold fingers, and gooseprickles rose on his bare skin. He leaned against the stone sill and looked out on dark towers, empty yards, black sky, and more stars than a man could ever count if he lived to be a hundred. A half-moon floated above the Bell Tower and cast its reflection on the roof of the glass gardens. He heard no alarms, no voices, not so much as a footfall.\nAll\u2019s well, Greyjoy. Hear the quiet? You ought to be drunk with joy. You took Winterfell with fewer than thirty men, a feat to sing of. Theon started back to bed. He\u2019d roll Kyra on her back and fuck her again, that ought to banish these phantoms. Her gasps and giggles would make a welcome respite from this silence.\nHe stopped. He had grown so used to the howling of the direwolves that he scarcely heard it anymore\u2026 but some part of him, some hunter\u2019s instinct, heard its absence.\nUrzen stood outside his door, a sinewy man with a round shield slung over his back. \u201cThe wolves are quiet,\u201d Theon told him. \u201cGo see what they\u2019re doing, and come straight back.\u201d The thought of the direwolves running loose gave him a queasy feeling. He remembered the day in the wolfswood when the wildlings had attacked Bran. Summer and Grey Wind had torn them to pieces.\nWhen he prodded Wex with the toe of his boot, the boy sat up and rubbed his eyes. \u201cMake certain Bran Stark and his little brother are in their beds, and be quick about it.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord?\u201d Kyra called sleepily.\n\u201cGo back to sleep, this does not concern you.\u201d Theon poured himself a cup of wine and drank it down. All the time he was listening, hoping to hear a howl. Too few men, he thought sourly. I have too few men. If Asha does not come\u2026\nWex returned the quickest, shaking his head side to side. Cursing, Theon found his tunic and breeches on the floor where he had dropped them in his haste to get at Kyra. Over the tunic he donned a jerkin of iron-studded leather, and he belted a longsword and dagger at his waist. His hair was wild as the wood, but he had larger concerns.\nBy then Urzen was back. \u201cThe wolves be gone.\u201d\nTheon told himself he must be as cold and deliberate as Lord Eddard. \u201cRouse the castle,\u201d he said. \u201cHerd them out into the yard, everyone, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s missing. And have Lorren make a round of the gates. Wex, with me.\u201d\nHe wondered if Stygg had reached Deepwood Motte yet. The man was not as skilled a rider as he claimed\u2014none of the ironmen were much good in the saddle\u2014but there\u2019d been time enough. Asha might well be on her way. And if she learns that I have lost the Starks\u2026 It did not bear thinking about.\nBran\u2019s bedchamber was empty, as was Rickon\u2019s half a turn below. Theon cursed himself. He should have kept a guard on them, but he\u2019d deemed it more important to have men walking the walls and protecting the gates than to nursemaid a couple of children, one a cripple.\nOutside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from their beds and driven into the yard. I\u2019ll give them reason to sob. I\u2019ve used them gently, and this is how they repay me. He\u2019d even had two of his own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl, to show them he meant to be just. They still blame me for the rape, though. And the rest. He deemed that unfair. Mikken had killed himself with his mouth, just as Benfred had. As for Chayle, he had to give someone to the Drowned God, his men expected it. \u201cI bear you no ill will,\u201d he\u2019d told the septon before they threw him down the well, \u201cbut you and your gods have no place here now.\u201d You\u2019d think the others might be grateful he hadn\u2019t chosen one of them, but no. He wondered how many of them were part of this plot against him.\nUrzen returned with Black Lorren. \u201cThe Hunter\u2019s Gate,\u201d Lorren said. \u201cBest come see.\u201d\nThe Hunter\u2019s Gate was conveniently sited close to the kennels and kitchens. It opened directly on fields and forests, allowing riders to come and go without first passing through the winter town, and so was favored by hunting parties. \u201cWho had the guard here?\u201d Theon demanded.\n\u201cDrennan and Squint.\u201d\nDrennan was one of the men who\u2019d raped Palla. \u201cIf they\u2019ve let the boys escape, I\u2019ll have more than a little skin off their back this time, I swear it.\u201d\n\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Black Lorren said curtly.\nNor was there. They found Squint floating facedown in the moat, his entrails drifting behind him like a nest of pale snakes. Drennan lay half naked in the gatehouse, in the snug room where the drawbridge was worked. His throat had been opened ear to ear. A ragged tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back, but his boots were scattered amidst the rushes, and his breeches tangled about his feet. There was cheese on a small table near the door, beside an empty flagon. And two cups.\nTheon picked one up and sniffed at the dregs of wine in the bottom. \u201cSquint was up on the wallwalk, no?\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Lorren.\nTheon flung the cup into the hearth. \u201cI\u2019d say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to stick it in the woman when she stuck it in him. His own cheese knife, by the look of it. Someone find a pike and fish the other fool out of the moat.\u201d\nThe other fool was in a deal worse shape than Drennan. When Black Lorren drew him out of the water, they saw that one of his arms had been wrenched off at the elbow, half of his neck was missing, and there was a ragged hole where his navel and groin once had been. The pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling him in. The stench was awful.\n\u201cThe direwolves,\u201d Theon said. \u201cBoth of them, at a guess.\u201d Disgusted, he walked back to the drawbridge. Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls, with a wide moat between them. The outer wall stood eighty feet high, the inner more than a hundred. Lacking men, Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post his guards along the higher inner walls. He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the castle rise against him.\nThere had to be two or more, he decided. While the woman was entertaining Drennan, the others freed the wolves.\nTheon called for a torch and led them up the steps to the wallwalk. He swept the flame low before him, looking for\u2026 there. On the inside of the rampart and in the wide crenel between two upthrust merlons. \u201cBlood,\u201d he announced, \u201cclumsily mopped up. At a guess, the woman killed Drennan and lowered the drawbridge. Squint heard the clank of chains, came to have a look, and got this far. They pushed the corpse through the crenel into the moat so he wouldn\u2019t be found by another sentry.\u201d\nUrzen peered along the walls. \u201cThe other watch turrets are not far. I see torches burning\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTorches, but no guards,\u201d Theon said testily. \u201cWinterfell has more turrets than I have men.\u201d\n\u201cFour guards at the main gate,\u201d said Black Lorren, \u201cand five walking the walls beside Squint.\u201d\nUrzen said, \u201cIf he had sounded his horn\u2014\u201d\nI am served by fools. \u201cTry and imagine it was you up here, Urzen. It\u2019s dark and cold. You have been walking sentry for hours, looking forward to the end of your watch. Then you hear a noise and move toward the gate, and suddenly you see eyes at the top of the stair, glowing green and gold in the torchlight. Two shadows come rushing toward you faster than you can believe. You catch a glimpse of teeth, start to level your spear, and they slam into you and open your belly, tearing through leather as if it were cheesecloth.\u201d He gave Urzen a hard shove. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re down on your back, your guts are spilling out, and one of them has his teeth around your neck.\u201d Theon grabbed the man\u2019s scrawny throat, tightened his fingers, and smiled. \u201cTell me, at what moment during all of this do you stop to blow your fucking horn?\u201d He shoved Urzen away roughly, sending him stumbling back against a merlon. The man rubbed his throat. I should have had those beasts put down the day we took the castle, he thought angrily. I\u2019d seen them kill, I knew how dangerous they were.\n\u201cWe must go after them,\u201d Black Lorren said.\n\u201cNot in the dark.\u201d Theon did not relish the idea of chasing direwolves through the wood by night; the hunters could easily become the hunted. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for daylight. Until then, I had best go speak with my loyal subjects.\u201d\nDown in the yard, a uneasy crowd of men, women, and children had been pushed up against the wall. Many had not been given time to dress; they covered themselves with woolen blankets, or huddled naked under cloaks or bedrobes. A dozen ironmen hemmed them in, torches in one hand and weapons in the other. The wind was gusting, and the flickering orange light reflected dully off steel helms, thick beards, and unsmiling eyes.\nTheon walked up and down before the prisoners, studying the faces. They all looked guilty to him. \u201cHow many are missing?\u201d\n\u201cSix.\u201d Reek stepped up behind him, smelling of soap, his long hair moving in the wind. \u201cBoth Starks, that bog boy and his sister, the halfwit from the stables, and your wildling woman.\u201d\nOsha. He had suspected her from the moment he saw that second cup. I should have known better than to trust that one. She\u2019s as unnatural as Asha. Even their names sound alike.\n\u201cHas anyone had a look at the stables?\u201d\n\u201cAggar says no horses are missing.\u201d\n\u201cDancer is still in his stall?\u201d\n\u201cDancer?\u201d Reek frowned. \u201cAggar says the horses are all there. Only the halfwit is missing.\u201d\nThey\u2019re afoot, then. That was the best news he\u2019d heard since he woke. Bran would be riding in his basket on Hodor\u2019s back, no doubt. Osha would need to carry Rickon; his little legs wouldn\u2019t take him far on their own. Theon was confident that he\u2019d soon have them back in his hands. \u201cBran and Rickon have fled,\u201d he told the castle folk, watching their eyes. \u201cWho knows where they\u2019ve gone?\u201d No one answered. \u201cThey could not have escaped without help,\u201d Theon went on. \u201cWithout food, clothing, weapons.\u201d He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell, but no doubt some had been hidden from him. \u201cI\u2019ll have the names of all those who aided them. All those who turned a blind eye.\u201d The only sound was the wind. \u201cCome first light, I mean to bring them back.\u201d He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt. \u201cI need huntsmen. Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter? Gage?\u201d The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt, to ask whether he\u2019d brought anything choice for the table, but he had nothing to say now. Theon walked back the way he had come, searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge. \u201cThe wild is no place for a cripple. And Rickon, young as he is, how long will he last out there? Nan, think how frightened he must be.\u201d The old woman had nattered at him for ten years, telling her endless stories, but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger. \u201cI might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure, but instead I protected you. Is this the thanks you offer?\u201d Joseth who\u2019d groomed his horses, Farlen who\u2019d taught him all he knew of hounds, Barth the brewer\u2019s wife who\u2019d been his first\u2014not one of them would meet his eyes. They hate me, he realized.\nReek stepped close. \u201cStrip off their skins,\u201d he urged, his thick lips glistening. \u201cLord Bolton, he used to say a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man\u2019s got none.\u201d\nThe flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton, Theon knew; ages past, certain of their lords had gone so far as to cloak themselves in the skins of dead enemies. A number of Starks had ended thus. Supposedly all that had stopped a thousand years ago, when the Boltons had bent their knees to Winterfell. Or so they say, but old ways die hard, as well I know.\n\u201cThere will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell,\u201d Theon said loudly. I am your only protection against the likes of him, he wanted to scream. He could not be that blatant, but perhaps some were clever enough to take the lesson.\nThe sky was greying over the castle walls. Dawn could not be far off. \u201cJoseth, saddle Smiler and a horse for yourself. Murch, Gariss, Poxy Tym, you\u2019ll come as well.\u201d Murch and Gariss were the best huntsmen in the castle, and Tym was a fine bowman. \u201cAggar, Rednose, Gelmarr, Reek, Wex.\u201d He needed his own to watch his back. \u201cFarlen, I\u2019ll want hounds, and you to handle them.\u201d\nThe grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms. \u201cAnd why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn lords, and babes at that?\u201d\nTheon moved close. \u201cI am your trueborn lord now, and the man who keeps Palla safe.\u201d\nHe saw the defiance die in Farlen\u2019s eyes. \u201cAye, m\u2019lord.\u201d\nStepping back, Theon glanced about to see who else he might add. \u201cMaester Luwin,\u201d he announced.\n\u201cI know nothing of hunting.\u201d\nNo, but I don\u2019t trust you in the castle in my absence. \u201cThen it\u2019s past time you learned.\u201d\n\u201cLet me come too. I want that wolfskin cloak.\u201d A boy stepped forward, no older than Bran. It took Theon a moment to remember him. \u201cI\u2019ve hunted lots of times before,\u201d Walder Frey said. \u201cRed deer and elk, and even boar.\u201d\nHis cousin laughed at him. \u201cHe rode on a boar hunt with his father, but they never let him near the boar.\u201d\nTheon look at the boy doubtfully. \u201cCome if you like, but if you can\u2019t keep up, don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll nurse you along.\u201d He turned back to Black Lorren. \u201cWinterfell is yours in my absence. If we do not return, do with it as you will.\u201d That bloody well ought to have them praying for my success.\nThey assembled by the Hunter\u2019s Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower, their breath frosting in the cold morning air. Gelmarr had equipped himself with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him. The blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow. Aggar wore steel greaves. Reek arrived carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman\u2019s sack bulging with god knows what. Theon had his bow; he needed nothing else. Once he had saved Bran\u2019s life with an arrow. He hoped he would not need to take it with another, but if it came to that, he would.\nEleven men, two boys, and a dozen dogs crossed the moat. Beyond the outer wall, the tracks were plain to read in the soft ground; the pawprints of the wolves, Hodor\u2019s heavy tread, the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds. Once under the trees, the stony ground and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see, but by then Farlen\u2019s red bitch had the scent. The rest of the dogs were close behind, the hounds sniffing and barking, a pair of monstrous mastiffs bringing up the rear. Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a cornered direwolf.\nHe\u2019d have guessed that Osha might run south to Ser Rodrik, but the trail led north by northwest, into the very heart of the wolfswood. Theon did not like that one bit. It would be a bitter irony if the Starks made for Deepwood Motte and delivered themselves right into Asha\u2019s hands. I\u2019d sooner have them dead, he thought bitterly. It is better to be seen as cruel than foolish.\nWisps of pale mist threaded between the trees. Sentinels and soldier pines grew thick about here, and there was nothing as dark and gloomy as an evergreen forest. The ground was uneven, and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing treacherous for the horses, so they had to go slowly. Not as slowly as a man carrying a cripple, though, or a bony harridan with a four-year-old on her back. He told himself to be patient. He\u2019d have them before the day was out.\nMaester Luwin trotted up to him as they were following a game trail along the lip of a ravine. \u201cThus far hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods, my lord.\u201d\nTheon smiled. \u201cThere are similarities. But with hunting, there\u2019s blood at the end.\u201d\n\u201cMust it be so? This flight was great folly, but will you not be merciful? These are your foster brothers we seek.\u201d\n\u201cNo Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me, but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living than dead.\u201d\n\u201cThe same is true of the Reeds. Moat Cailin sits on the edge of the bogs. Lord Howland can make your uncle\u2019s occupation a visit to hell if he chooses, but so long as you hold his heirs he must stay his hand.\u201d\nTheon had not considered that. In truth, he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all, beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if she was still a maiden. \u201cYou may be right. We will spare them if we can.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Hodor too, I hope. The boy is simple, you know that. He does as he is told. How many times has he groomed your horse, soaped your saddle, scoured your mail?\u201d\nHodor was nothing to him. \u201cif he does not fight us, we will let him live.\u201d Theon pointed a finger. \u201cBut say one word about sparing the wildling, and you can die with her. She swore me an oath, and pissed on it.\u201d\nThe maester inclined his head. \u201cI make no apologies for oathbreakers. Do what you must. I thank you for your mercy.\u201d\nMercy, thought Theon as Luwin dropped back. There\u2019s a bloody trap. Too much and they call you weak, too little and you\u2019re monstrous. Yet the maester had given him good counsel, he knew. His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it? Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them. Sansa was a pretty little thing too, and by now likely even ripe for bedding. But she was a thousand leagues away, in the clutches of the Lannisters. A shame.\nThe wood grew ever wilder. The pines and sentinels gave way to huge dark oaks. Tangles of hawthorn concealed treacherous gullies and cuts. Stony hills rose and fell. They passed a crofter\u2019s cottage, deserted and overgown, and skirted a flooded quarry where the still water had a sheen as grey as steel. When the dogs began to bay, Theon figured the fugitives were near at hand. He spurred Smiler and followed at a trot, but what he found was only the carcass of a young elk\u2026 or what remained of it.\nHe dismounted for a closer look. The kill was still fresh, and plainly the work of wolves. The dogs sniffed round it eagerly, and one of the mastiffs buried his teeth in a haunch until Farlen shouted him off. No part of this animal has been butchered, Theon realized. The wolves ate, but not the men. Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire, she ought to have cut them a few steaks. It made no sense to leave so much good meat to rot. \u201cFarlen, are you certain we\u2019re on the right trail?\u201d he demanded. \u201cCould your dogs be chasing the wrong wolves?\u201d\n\u201cMy bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so. For your sake.\u201d\nLess than an hour later, the trail led down a slope toward a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains. It was there the dogs lost the scent. Farlen and Wex waded across with the hounds and came back shaking their heads while the animals ranged up and down the far bank, sniffing. \u201cThey went in here, m\u2019lord, but I can\u2019t see where they come out,\u201d the kennelmaster said.\nTheon dismounted and knelt beside the stream. He dipped a hand in it. The water was cold. \u201cThey won\u2019t have stayed long in this,\u201d he said. \u201cTake half the dogs downstream, I\u2019ll go up\u2014\u201d\nWex clapped his hands together loudly.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Theon said.\nThe mute boy pointed.\nThe ground near the water was sodden and muddy. The tracks the wolves had left were plain enough. \u201cPawprints, yes. So?\u201d\nWex drove his heel into the mud, and pivoted his foot this way and that. It left a deep gouge.\nJoseth understood. \u201cA man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud,\u201d he said. \u201cMore so with the weight of a boy on his back. Yet the only boot prints here are our own. See for yourself.\u201d\nAppalled, Theon saw it was true. The wolves had gone into the turgid brown water alone. \u201cOsha must have turned aside back of us. Before the elk, most likely. She sent the wolves on by themselves, hoping we\u2019d chase after them.\u201d He rounded on his huntsmen. \u201cIf you two have played me false\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been only the one trail, my lord, I swear it,\u201d said Gariss defensively. \u201cAnd the direwolves would never have parted from them boys. Not for long.\u201d\nThat\u2019s so, Theon thought. Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt, but soon or late they would return to Bran and Rickon. \u201cGariss, Murch, take four dogs and double back, find where we lost them. Aggar, you watch them, I\u2019ll have no trickery. Farlen and I will follow the direwolves. Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail. Two blasts if you catch sight of the beasts themselves. Once we find where they went, they\u2019ll lead us back to their masters.\u201d\nHe took Wex, the Frey boy, and Gynir Rednose to search upstream. He and Wex rode on one side of the brook, Rednose and Walder Frey on the other, each with a pair of hounds. The wolves might have come out on either bank. Theon kept an eye out for tracks, spoor, broken branches, any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water. He spied the prints of deer, elk, and badger easily enough. Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream, and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one. They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch. But of the direwolves there was no sign.\nA little farther, Theon told himself. Past that oak, over that rise, past the next bend of the stream, we\u2019ll find something there. He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back, a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly. It was midday when he wrenched Smiler\u2019s head round in disgust and gave up.\nSomehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him. It should not have been possible, not on foot, burdened with a cripple and a young child. Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape. If they reach a village\u2026 The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark\u2019s sons, Robb\u2019s brothers. They\u2019d have mounts to speed them on their way, food. Men would fight for the honor of protecting them. The whole bloody north would rally around them.\nThe wolves went downstream, that\u2019s all. He clung to that thought. That red bitch will sniff where they came out of the water and we\u2019ll be after them again.\nBut when they joined up with Farlen\u2019s party, one look at the kennelmaster\u2019s face smashed all of Theon\u2019s hopes to shards. \u201cThe only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear baiting,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cWould that I had a bear.\u201d\n\u201cThe dogs are not at fault.\u201d Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch, a hand on each. \u201cRunning water don\u2019t hold no scents, m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\u201cThe wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt they did. Upstream or down. We keep on, we\u2019ll find the place, but which way?\u201d\n\u201cI never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles,\u201d said Reek. \u201cA man might. If he knew he was being hunted, he might. But a wolf?\u201d\nYet Theon wondered. These beasts were not as other wolves. I should have skinned the cursed things.\nIt was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss, Murch, and Aggar. The huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the Starks might have parted company with the direwolves. Farlen\u2019s hounds seemed as frustrated as their masters, sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other.\nTheon dared not admit defeat. \u201cWe\u2019ll return to the brook. Search again. This time we\u2019ll go as far as we must.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t find them,\u201d the Frey boy said suddenly. \u201cNot so long as the frogeaters are with them. Mudmen are sneaks, they won\u2019t fight like decent folks, they skulk and use poison arrows, You never see them, but they see you. Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out. Their houses move, even the castles like Greywater Watch.\u201d He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides. \u201cThey might be out there right now, listening to everything we say.\u201d\nFarlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion. \u201cMy dogs would smell anything in them bushes. Be all over them before you could break wind, boy.\u201d\n\u201cFrogeaters don\u2019t smell like men,\u201d Frey insisted. \u201cThey have a boggy stink, like frogs and trees and scummy water. Moss grows under their arms in place of hair, and they can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water.\u201d\nTheon was about to tell him what he ought to do with his wet nurse\u2019s fable when Maester Luwin spoke up. \u201cThe histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck. It may be that they have secret knowledge.\u201d\nSuddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than it had a moment before, as if a cloud had passed before the sun. It was one thing to have some fool boy spouting folly, but maesters were supposed to be wise. \u201cThe only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon,\u201d Theon said. \u201cBack to the stream. Now.\u201d\nFor a moment he did not think they were going to obey, but in the end old habit asserted itself. They followed sullenly, but they followed. The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits he\u2019d flushed earlier. Theon put men on either bank and followed the current. They rode for miles, going slow and careful, dismounting to lead the horses over treacherous ground, letting the good-for-bear-bait hounds sniff at every bush. Where a fallen tree dammed the flow, the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool, but if the direwolves had done the same they\u2019d left neither print nor spoor. The beasts had taken to swimming, it seemed. When I catch them, they\u2019ll have all the swimming they can stomach. I\u2019ll give them both to the Drowned God.\nWhen the woods began to darken, Theon Greyjoy knew he was beaten. Either the crannogmen did know the magic of the children of the forest, or else Osha had deceived them with some wildling trick. He made them press on through the dusk, but when the last light faded Joseth finally worked up the courage to say, \u201cThis is fruitless, my lord. We will lame a horse, break a leg.\u201d\n\u201cJoseth has the right of it,\u201d said Maester Luwin. \u201cGroping through the woods by torchlight will avail us nothing.\u201d\nTheon could taste bile at the back of his throat, and his stomach was a nest of snakes twining and snapping at each other. If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed, he might as well dress in motley henceforth and wear a pointed hat; the whole north would know him for a fool. And when my father hears, and Asha\u2026\n\u201cM\u2019lord prince.\u201d Reek urged his horse near. \u201cMight be them Starks never came this way. If I was them, I would have gone north and east, maybe. To the Umbers. Good Stark men, they are. But their lands are a long way. The boys will shelter someplace nearer. Might be I know where.\u201d\nTheon looked at him suspiciously. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that old mill, sitting lonely on the Acorn Water? We stopped there when I was being dragged to Winterfell a captive. The miller\u2019s wife sold us hay for our horses while that old knight clucked over her brats. Might be the Starks are hiding there.\u201d\nTheon knew the mill. He had even tumbled the miller\u2019s wife a time or two. There was nothing special about it, or her. \u201cWhy there? There are a dozen villages and holdfasts just as close.\u201d\nAmusement shone in those pale eyes. \u201cWhy? Now that\u2019s past knowing. But they\u2019re there, I have a feeling.\u201d\nHe was growing sick of the man\u2019s sly answers. His lips look like two worms fucking. \u201cWhat are you saying? If you\u2019ve kept some knowledge from me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord prince?\u201d Reek dismounted, and beckoned Theon to do the same. When they were both afoot, he pulled open the cloth sack he\u2019d fetched from Winterfell. \u201cHave a look here.\u201d\nIt was growing hard to see. Theon thrust his hand into the sack impatiently, groping amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool. A sharp point pricked his skin, and his fingers closed around something cold and hard. He drew out a wolf\u2019s-head brooch, silver and jet. Understanding came suddenly. His hand closed into a fist. \u201cGelmarr,\u201d he said, wondering whom he could trust. None of them. \u201cAggar. Rednose. With us. The rest of you may return to Winterfell with the hounds. I\u2019ll have no further need of them. I know where Bran and Rickon are hiding now.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Theon,\u201d Maester Luwin entreated, \u201cyou will remember your promise? Mercy, you said.\u201d\n\u201cMercy was for this morning,\u201d said Theon. It is better to be feared than laughed at. \u201cBefore they made me angry.\u201d",

      "content": "Jon\nThey could see the fire in the night, glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star. It burned redder than the other stars, and did not twinkle, though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark, dull and faint.\nHalf a mile ahead and two thousand feet up, Jon judged, and perfectly placed to see anything moving in the pass below.\n\u201cWatchers in the Skirling Pass,\u201d wondered the oldest among them. In the spring of his youth, he had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge. \u201cWhat is it Mance Rayder fears, I wonder?\u201d\n\u201cIf he knew they\u2019d lit a fire, he\u2019d flay the poor bastards,\u201d said Ebben, a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks.\n\u201cFire is life up here,\u201d said Qhorin Halfhand, \u201cbut it can be death as well.\u201d By his command, they\u2019d risked no open flames since entering the mountains. They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, grateful for each other\u2019s warmth. It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when he\u2019d shared a bed with his brothers. These men were brothers too, though the bed they shared was stone and earth.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have a horn,\u201d said Stonesnake.\nThe Halfhand said, \u201cA horn they must not blow.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long cruel climb by night,\u201d Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them. The sky was cloudless, the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top, where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight.\n\u201cAnd a longer fall,\u201d said Qhorin Halfhand. \u201cTwo men, I think. There are like to be two up there, sharing the watch.\u201d\n\u201cMe.\u201d The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them. It would have to be him.\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d said Jon Snow.\nQhorin Halfhand looked at him. Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through the high pass above them. One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter. \u201cThe wolf will remain with us,\u201d Qhorin said. \u201cWhite fur is seen too easily by moonlight.\u201d He turned to Stonesnake. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done, throw down a burning brand. We\u2019ll come when we see it fall.\u201d\n\u201cNo better time to start than now,\u201d said Stonesnake.\nThey each took a long coil of rope. Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt. Their garrons they left behind, along with their helms, mail, and Ghost. Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off. \u201cStay,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you.\u201d\nStonesnake took the lead. He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known. He needed them tonight. By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black. Now the rising moon had linmed them in white and silver.\nThe black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air. Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight. This was hard going, and slow. To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse. Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.\nThe Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, a long twisting course that went up around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun. Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they\u2019d left the wood behind and begun to make their way upward. The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place the gods had made, and as inimical to men. The wind cut like a knife up here, and shrilled in the night like a mother mourning her slain children. What few trees they saw were stunted, grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures. Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a distance.\nYet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come. There were wonders here as well. He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper\u2019s grass in russet and gold. He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side. Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky. Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce.\nNow it is our turn to pounce. He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly. Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it. He carried dirk and dagger for closer work. They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored. He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night\u2019s end, and who the ram.\nFor a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward. Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear. The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses. In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch. Even where the track widened it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man\u2019s leg, rubble to stumble over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night. One step and then another, Jon told himself. One step and then another, and I will not fall.\nHe had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on his lip was soon stiff with frost. Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the mountain. One step and then another, he resumed when the gale subsided. One step and then another, and I will not fall.\nSoon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered. There was nothing below but yawning blackness, nothing above but moon and stars. \u201cThe mountain is your mother,\u201d Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past. \u201cCling to her, press your face up against her teats, and she won\u2019t drop you.\u201d Jon had made a joke of it, saying how he\u2019d always wondered who his mother was, but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs. It did not seem nearly so amusing now. One step and then another, he thought, clinging tight.\nThe narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain. After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave. \u201cStraight up here,\u201d the ranger said in a quiet voice. \u201cWe want to get above them.\u201d He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope around his waist, the other end around Jon. \u201cFollow me when the rope grows taut.\u201d The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, faster than Jon would have believed. The long rope unwound slowly. Jon watched him closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly.\nStonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on, but as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again. This time there was no convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether, so he took out his felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps. Soft as the sounds were, they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain that the wildlings must hear them too. When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the rope to it, and Jon started after him. Suck on the mountain\u2019s teat, he reminded himself. Don\u2019t look down. Keep your weight above your feet. Don\u2019t look down. Look at the rock in front of you. There\u2019s a good handhold, yes. Don\u2019t look down. I can catch a breath on that ledge there, all I need to do is reach it. Never look down.\nOnce his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest, but the gods were good and he did not fall. He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his fingers, but he dared not don his gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight they seemed, cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill him. His burned hand was stiffening up on him, and soon it began to ache. Then he ripped open his thumbnail somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand. He hoped he still had all his fingers by the end of the climb.\nUp they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock. Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire. They were close now, though. Jon could sense it. Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his brother at Winterfell. Bran used to love to climb. I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.\nThe wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone. Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up. He had donned his gloves again, so Jon did the same. The ranger moved his head to the left, and the two of them crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more, until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff.\nThe wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the wind. That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of them, creeping along on their bellies until they were looking down on the men they must kill.\nOne was asleep, curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins. Jon could see nothing of him but his hair, bright red in the firelight. The second sat close to the flames, feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone. The third watched the pass, though there was little to see, only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the snowy shoulders of the mountains. It was the watcher who wore the horn.\nThree. For a moment Jon was uncertain. There was only supposed to be two. One was asleep, though. And whether there was two or three or twenty, he still must do what he had come to do. Stonesnake touched his arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn. Jon nodded toward the one by the fire. It felt queer, picking a man to kill. Half the days of his life had been spent with sword and shield, training for this moment. Did Robb feel this way before his first battle? he wondered, but there was no time to ponder the question. Stonesnake moved as fast as his namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles. Jon slid Longclaw from its sheath and followed.\nIt all seemed to happen in a heartbeat. Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade. He got it to his lips, but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword. Jon\u2019s man leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand. He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew he must finish his man quick. When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the bastard sword with both hands. The Valyrian steel sheared through leather, fur, wool, and flesh, but when the wildling fell he twisted, ripping the sword from Jon\u2019s grasp. On the ground the sleeper sat up beneath his furs. Jon slid his dirk free, grabbing the man by the hair and jamming the point of the knife up under his chin as he reached for his\u2014no, her\u2014\nHis hand froze. \u201cA girl.\u201d\n\u201cA watcher,\u201d said Stonesnake. \u201cA wildling. Finish her.\u201d\nJon could see fear and fire in her eyes. Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her. One thrust and it\u2019s done, he told himself. He was so close he could smell onion on her breath. She is no older than I am. Something about her made him think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike. \u201cWill you yield?\u201d he asked, giving the dirk a half turn. And if she doesn\u2019t?\n\u201cI yield.\u201d Her words steamed in the cold air.\n\u201cYou\u2019re our captive, then.\u201d He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat.\n\u201cQhorin said nothing of taking captives,\u201d said Stonesnake.\n\u201cHe never said not to.\u201d Jon let go his grip on the girl\u2019s hair, and she scuttled backward, away from them.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a spearwife.\u201d Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her sleeping furs. \u201cShe was reaching for that when you grabbed her. Give her half a chance and she\u2019ll bury it between your eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t give her half a chance.\u201d Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl\u2019s reach. \u201cDo you have a name?\u201d\n\u201cYgritte.\u201d Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody. She stared at the wetness.\nSheathing his dirk, he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he\u2019d killed. \u201cYou are my captive, Ygritte.\u201d\n\u201cI gave you my name.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Jon Snow.\u201d\nShe flinched. \u201cAn evil name.\u201d\n\u201cA bastard name,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.\u201d\nThe girl watched him warily, but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s the captive supposed to tell things, remember?\u201d The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire. \u201cNot that she will. I\u2019ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they\u2019d answer a question.\u201d When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung it out over the pass. It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight.\n\u201cYou ought to burn them you killed,\u201d said Ygritte.\n\u201cNeed a bigger fire for that, and big fires burn bright.\u201d Stonesnake turned, his eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light. \u201cAre there more wildlings close by, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cBurn them,\u201d the girl repeated stubbornly, \u201cor it might be you\u2019ll need them swords again.\u201d\nJon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands. \u201cMaybe we should do as she says.\u201d\n\u201cThere are other ways.\u201d Stonesnake knelt beside the man he\u2019d slain, stripped him of cloak and boots and belt and vest, then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it to the edge. He grunted as he tossed it over. A moment later they heard a wet, heavy smack well below them. By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging it by the arms. Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of the night.\nYgritte watched and said nothing. She was older than he\u2019d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose. Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions. She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather. Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.\n\u201cWere you sent to watch for us?\u201d Jon asked her.\n\u201cYou, and others.\u201d\nStonesnake warmed his hands over the fire. \u201cWhat waits beyond the pass?\u201d\n\u201cThe free folk.\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cHundreds and thousands. More than you ever saw, crow.\u201d She smiled. Her teeth were crooked, but very white.\nShe doesn\u2019t know how many. \u201cWhy come here?\u201d\nYgritte fell silent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the Frostfangs that your king could want? You can\u2019t stay here, there\u2019s no food.\u201d\nShe turned her face away from him.\n\u201cDo you mean to march on the Wall? When?\u201d\nShe stared at the flames as if she could not hear him.\n\u201cDo you know anything of my uncle, Benjen Stark?\u201d\nYgritte ignored him. Stonesnake laughed. \u201cif she spits out her tongue, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d\nA low rumbling growl echoed off the rock. Shadowcat, Jon knew at once. As he rose he heard another, closer at hand. He pulled his sword and turned, listening.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t trouble us,\u201d Ygritte said. \u201cIt\u2019s the dead they\u2019ve come for. Cats can smell blood six miles off. They\u2019ll stay near the bodies till they\u2019ve eaten every last stringy shred o\u2019 meat, and cracked the bones for the marrow.\u201d\nJon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks. It gave him an uneasy feeling. The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was, but he dared not sleep. He had taken a captive, and it was on him to guard her. \u201cWere they your kin?\u201d he asked her quietly. \u201cThe two we killed?\u201d\n\u201cNo more than you are.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou said you were the Bastard o\u2019 Winterfell.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cWho was your mother?\u201d\n\u201cSome woman. Most of them are.\u201d Someone had said that to him once. He did not remember who.\nShe smiled again, a flash of white teeth. \u201cAnd she never sung you the song o\u2019 the winter rose?\u201d\n\u201cI never knew my mother. Or any such song.\u201d\n\u201cBael the Bard made it,\u201d said Ygritte. \u201cHe was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back. All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don\u2019t sing them in the south.\u201d\n\u201cWinterfell\u2019s not in the south,\u201d Jon objected.\n\u201cYes it is. Everything below the Wall\u2019s south to us.\u201d\nHe had never thought of it that way. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all in where you\u2019re standing.\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d Ygritte agreed. \u201cIt always is.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Jon urged her. It would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would help keep him awake. \u201cI want to hear this tale of yours.\u201d\n\u201cMight be you won\u2019t like it much.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear it all the same.\u201d\n\u201cBrave black crow,\u201d she mocked. \u201cWell, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great raider.\u201d\nStonesnake gave a snort. \u201cA murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all in where you\u2019re standing too,\u201d Ygritte said. \u201cThe Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael\u2019s head, but never could take him, and the taste o\u2019 failure galled him. One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o\u2019 that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter\u2019s night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos. Sygerrik means \u2018deceiver\u2019 in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.\n\u201cNorth or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark\u2019s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he\u2019d made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. \u2018All I ask is a flower,\u2019 Bael answered, \u2018the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o\u2019 Winterfell.\u2019\n\u201cNow as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o\u2019 the winter roses be plucked for the singer\u2019s payment. And so it was done. But when morning come, the singer had vanished\u2026 and so had Lord Brandon\u2019s maiden daughter. Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.\u201d\nJon had never heard this tale before. \u201cWhich Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael. There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis was Brandon the Daughterless,\u201d Ygritte said sharply. \u201cWould you hear the tale, or no?\u201d\nHe scowled. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cLord Brandon had no other children. At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o\u2019 Bael or this maid. For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line o\u2019 Starks was at its end. But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child\u2019s cry. He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.\u201d\n\u201cBael had brought her back?\u201d\n\u201cNo. They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle. The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says\u2026 though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote. Be that as it may, what\u2019s certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he\u2019d plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark. So there it is\u2014you have Bael\u2019s blood in you, same as me.\u201d\n\u201cIt never happened,\u201d Jon said.\nShe shrugged. \u201cMight be it did, might be it didn\u2019t. It is a good song, though. My mother used to sing it to me. She was a woman too, Jon Snow. Like yours.\u201d She rubbed her throat where his dirk had cut her. \u201cThe song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end to the story. Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford\u2026 and killed him, for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.\u201d\n\u201cSo the son slew the father instead,\u201d said Jon.\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing. When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael\u2019s head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief. Her son did not long outlive her. One o\u2019 his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.\u201d\n\u201cYour Bael was a liar,\u201d he told her, certain now.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ygritte said, \u201cbut a bard\u2019s truth is different than yours or mine. Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it.\u201d She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep.\nDawn and Qhorin Halfhand arrived together. The black stones had turned to grey and the eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below, wending their way upward. Jon woke his captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet them. Thankfully, there was another way off the mountain to the north and west, along paths much gentler than the one that had brought them up here. They were waiting in a narrow defile when their brothers appeared, leading their garrons. Ghost raced ahead at first scent of them. Jon squatted to let the direwolf close his jaws around his wrist, tugging his hand back and forth. It was a game they played. But when he glanced up, he saw Ygritte watching with eyes as wide and white as hen\u2019s eggs.\nQhorin Halfhand made no comment when he saw the prisoner. \u201cThere were three,\u201d Stonesnake told him. No more than that.\n\u201cWe passed two,\u201d Ebben said, \u201cor what the cats had left of them.\u201d He eyed the girl sourly, suspicion plain on his face.\n\u201cShe yielded,\u201d Jon felt compelled to say.\nQhorin\u2019s face was impassive. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cQhorin Halfhand.\u201d The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly.\n\u201cTell me true. If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself, what would it win me?\u201d\n\u201cA slower death than elsewise.\u201d\nThe big ranger looked to Jon. \u201cWe have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to watch her.\u201d\n\u201cThe way before us is perilous enough, lad,\u201d said Squire Dalbridge. \u201cOne shout when we need silence, and every man of us is doomed.\u201d\nEbben drew his dagger. \u201cA steel kiss will keep her quiet.\u201d\nJon\u2019s throat was raw. He looked at them all helplessly. \u201cShe yielded herself to me.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must do what needs be done,\u201d Qhorin Halfhand said. \u201cYou are the blood of Winterfell and a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d He looked at the others. \u201cCome, brothers. Leave him to it. It will go easier for him if we do not watch.\u201d And he led them up the steep twisting trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl.\nHe thought Ygritte might try to run, but she only stood there, waiting, looking at him. \u201cYou never killed a woman before, did you?\u201d When he shook his head, she said, \u201cWe die the same as men. But you don\u2019t need to do it. Mance would take you, I know he would. There\u2019s secret ways. Them crows would never catch us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m as much a crow as they are,\u201d Jon said.\nShe nodded, resigned. \u201cWill you burn me, after?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t. The smoke might be seen.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWell, there\u2019s worse places to end up than the belly of a shadowcat.\u201d\nHe pulled Longclaw over a shoulder. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\n\u201cLast night I was,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut now the sun\u2019s up.\u201d She pushed her hair aside to bare her neck, and knelt before him. \u201cStrike hard and true, crow, or I\u2019ll come back and haunt you.\u201d\nLongclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father\u2019s Ice, but it was Valyrian steel all the same. He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall, and Ygritte shivered. \u201cThat\u2019s cold,\u201d she said. \u201cGo on, be quick about it.\u201d\nHe raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his father\u2019s son. Wasn\u2019t he? Wasn\u2019t he?\n\u201cDo it,\u201d she urged him after a moment. \u201cBastard. Do it. I can\u2019t stay brave forever.\u201d When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him.\nJon lowered his sword. \u201cGo,\u201d he muttered.\nYgritte stared.\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore my wits return. Go.\u201d\nShe went.",

      "content": "Sansa\nThe southern sky was black with smoke. It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires, its sooty fingers smudging out the stars. Across the Blackwater Rush, a line of flame burned nightly from horizon to horizon, while on this side the Imp had fired the whole riverfront: docks and warehouses, homes and brothels, everything outside the city walls.\nEven in the Red Keep, the air tasted of ashes. When Sansa found Ser Dontos in the quiet of the godswood, he asked if she\u2019d been crying. \u201cIt\u2019s only from the smoke,\u201d she lied. \u201cIt looks as though half the kingswood is burning.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imp\u2019s savages.\u201d Dontos swayed as he spoke, one hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree. A wine stain discolored the red-and-yellow motley of his tunic. \u201cThey kill his scouts and raid his baggage train. And the wildlings have been lighting fires too. The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train his horses to eat ash, since he would find no blade of grass. I heard him say so. I hear all sorts of things as a fool that I never heard when I was a knight. They talk as though I am not there, and\u201d\u2014he leaned close, breathing his winey breath right in her face\u2014\u201cthe Spider pays in gold for any little trifle. I think Moon Boy has been his for years.\u201d\nHe is drunk again. My poor Florian he names himself, and so he is. But he is all I have. \u201cIs it true Lord Stannis burned the godswood at Storm\u2019s End?\u201d\nDontos nodded. \u201cHe made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to his new god. The red priestess made him do it. They say she rules him now, body and soul. He\u2019s vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor too, if he takes the city.\u201d\n\u201cLet him.\u201d When Sansa had first beheld the Great Sept with its marble walls and seven crystal towers, she\u2019d thought it was the most beautiful building in the world, but that had been before Joffrey beheaded her father on its steps. \u201cI want it burned.\u201d\n\u201cHush, child, the gods will hear you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should they? They never hear my prayers.\u201d\n\u201cYes they do. They sent me to you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\nSansa picked at the bark of a tree. She felt light-headed, almost feverish. \u201cThey sent you, but what good have you done? You promised you would take me home, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d\nDontos patted her arm. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a certain man I know, a good friend to me\u2026 and you, my lady. He will hire a swift ship to take us to safety, when the time is right.\u201d\n\u201cThe time is right now,\u201d Sansa insisted, \u201cbefore the fighting starts. They\u2019ve forgotten about me. I know we could slip away if we tried.\u201d\n\u201cChild, child.\u201d Dontos shook his head. \u201cOut of the castle, yes, we could do that, but the city gates are more heavily guarded than ever, and the Imp has even closed off the river.\u201d\nIt was true. The Blackwater Rush was as empty as Sansa had ever seen it. All the ferries had been withdrawn to the north bank, and the trading galleys had fled or been seized by the Imp to be made over for battle. The only ships to be seen were the king\u2019s war galleys. They rowed endlessly up and down, staying to the deep water in the middle of the river and exchanging flights of arrows with Stannis\u2019s archers on the south shore.\nLord Stannis himself was still on the march, but his vanguard had appeared two nights ago during the black of the moon. King\u2019s Landing had woken to the sight of their tents and banners. They were five thousand, Sansa had heard, near as many as all the gold cloaks in the city. They flew the red or green apples of House Fossoway, the turtle of Estermont, and the fox-and-flowers of Florent, and their commander was Ser Guyard Morrigen, a famous southron knight who men now called Guyard the Green. His standard showed a crow in flight, its black wings spread wide against a storm-green sky. But it was the pale yellow banners that worried the city. Long ragged tails streamed behind them like flickering flames, and in place of a lord\u2019s sigil they bore the device of a god: the burning heart of the Lord of Light.\n\u201cWhen Stannis comes, he\u2019ll have ten times as many men as Joffrey does, everyone says so.\u201d\nDontos squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThe size of his host does not matter, sweetling, so long as they are on the wrong side of the river. Stannis cannot cross without ships.\u201d\n\u201cHe has ships. More than Joffrey.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long sail from Storm\u2019s End, the fleet will need to come up Massey\u2019s Hook and through the Gullet and across Blackwater Bay. Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to sweep them from the seas.\u201d Dontos gave a hopeful smile. \u201cIt is not easy for you, I know. You must be patient, child. When my friend returns to the city, we shall have our ship. Have faith in your Florian, and try not to be afraid.\u201d\nSansa dug her nails into her hand. She could feel the fear in her tummy, twisting and pinching, worse every day. Nightmares of the day Princess Myrcella had sailed still troubled her sleep; dark suffocating dreams that woke her in the black of night, struggling for breath. She could hear the people screaming at her, screaming without words, like animals. They had hemmed her in and thrown filth at her and tried to pull her off her horse, and would have done worse if the Hound had not cut his way to her side. They had torn the High Septon to pieces and smashed in Ser Aron\u2019s head with a rock. Try not to be afraid! he said.\nThe whole city was afraid. Sansa could see it from the castle walls. The smallfolk were hiding themselves behind closed shutters and barred doors as if that would keep them safe. The last time King\u2019s Landing had fallen, the Lannisters looted and raped as they pleased and put hundreds to the sword, even though the city had opened its gates. This time the Imp meant to fight, and a city that fought could expect no mercy at all.\nDontos was prattling on. \u201cIf I were still a knight, I should have to put on armor and man the walls with the rest. I ought to kiss King Joffrey\u2019s feet and thank him sweetly.\u201d\n\u201cIf you thanked him for making you a fool, he\u2019d make you a knight again,\u201d Sansa said sharply.\nDontos chuckled. \u201cMy Jonquil\u2019s a clever girl, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cJoffrey and his mother say I\u2019m stupid.\u201d\n\u201cLet them. You\u2019re safer that way, sweetling. Queen Cersei and the Imp and Lord Varys and their like, they all watch each other keen as hawks, and pay this one and that one to spy out what the others are doing, but no one ever troubles themselves about Lady Tanda\u2019s daughter, do they?\u201d Dontos covered his mouth to stifle a burp. \u201cGods preserve you, my little Jonquil.\u201d He was growing weepy. The wine did that to him. \u201cGive your Florian a little kiss now. A kiss for luck.\u201d He swayed toward her.\nSansa dodged the wet groping lips, kissed him lightly on an unshaven cheek, and bid him good night. It took all her strength not to weep. She had been weeping too much of late. It was unseemly, she knew, but she could not seem to help herself; the tears would come, sometimes over a trifle, and nothing she did could hold them back.\nThe drawbridge to Maegor\u2019s Holdfast was unguarded. The Imp had moved most of the gold cloaks to the city walls, and the white knights of the Kingsguard had duties more important than dogging her heels. Sansa could go where she would so long as she did not try to leave the castle, but there was nowhere she wanted to go.\nShe crossed over the dry moat with its cruel iron spikes and made her way up the narrow turnpike stair, but when she reached the door of her bedchamber she could not bear to enter. The very walls of the room made her feel trapped; even with the window opened wide it felt as though there were no air to breathe.\nTurning back to the stair, Sansa climbed. The smoke blotted out the stars and the thin crescent of moon, so the roof was dark and thick with shadows. Yet from here she could see everything: the Red Keep\u2019s tall towers and great cornerforts, the maze of city streets beyond, to south and west the river running black, the bay to the east, the columns of smoke and cinders, and fires, fires everywhere. Soldiers crawled over the city walls like ants with torches, and crowded the hoardings that had sprouted from the ramparts. Down by the Mud Gate, outlined against the drifting smoke, she could make out the vague shape of the three huge catapults, the biggest anyone had ever seen, overtopping the walls by a good twenty feet. Yet none of it made her feel less fearful. A stab went through her, so sharp that Sansa sobbed and clutched at her belly. She might have fallen, but a shadow moved suddenly, and strong fingers grabbed her arm and steadied her.\nShe grabbed a merlon for support, her fingers scrabbling at the rough stone. \u201cLet go of me,\u201d she cried. \u201cLet go.\u201d\n\u201cThe little bird thinks she has wings, does she? Or do you mean to end up crippled like that brother of yours?\u201d\nSansa twisted in his grasp. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to fall. It was only\u2026 you startled me, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean I scared you. And still do.\u201d\nShe took a deep breath to calm herself. \u201cI thought I was alone, I\u2026\u201d She glanced away.\n\u201cThe little bird still can\u2019t bear to look at me, can she?\u201d The Hound released her. \u201cYou were glad enough to see my face when the mob had you, though. Remember?\u201d\nSansa remembered all too well. She remembered the way they had howled, the feel of the blood running down her cheek from where the stone had struck her, and the garlic stink on the breath of the man who had tried to pull her from her horse. She could still feel the cruel pinch of fingers on her wrist as she lost her balance and began to fall.\nShe\u2019d thought she was going to die then, but the fingers had twitched, all five at once, and the man had shrieked loud as a horse. When his hand fell away, another hand, stronger, shoved her back into her saddle. The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood pumping out the stump of his arm, but there were others all around, some with clubs in hand. The Hound leapt at them, his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung. When they broke and ran before him he had laughed, his terrible burned face for a moment transformed.\nShe made herself look at that face now, really look. It was only courteous, and a lady must never forget her courtesies. The scars are not the worst part, nor even the way his mouth twitches. It\u2019s his eyes. She had never seen eyes so full of anger. \u201cI\u2026 I should have come to you after,\u201d she said haltingly. \u201cTo thank you, for\u2026 for saving me\u2026 you were so brave.\u201d\n\u201cBrave?\u201d His laugh was half a snarl. \u201cA dog doesn\u2019t need courage to chase off rats. They had me thirty to one, and not a man of them dared face me.\u201d\nShe hated the way he talked, always so harsh and angry. \u201cDoes it give you joy to scare people?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it gives me joy to kill people.\u201d His mouth twitched. \u201cWrinkle up your face all you like, but spare me this false piety. You were a high lord\u2019s get. Don\u2019t tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.\u201d\n\u201cThat was his duty. He never liked it.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what he told you?\u201d Clegane laughed again. \u201cYour father lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.\u201d He drew his longsword. \u201cHere\u2019s your truth. Your precious father found that out on Baelor\u2019s steps. Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King, Warden of the North, the mighty Eddard Stark, of a line eight thousand years old\u2026 but Ilyn Payne\u2019s blade went through his neck all the same, didn\u2019t it? Do you remember the dance he did when his head came off his shoulders?\u201d\nSansa hugged herself, suddenly cold. \u201cWhy are you always so hateful? I was thanking you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust as if I was one of those true knights you love so well, yes. What do you think a knight is for, girl? You think it\u2019s all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate? Knights are for killing.\u201d He laid the edge of his longsword against her neck, just under her ear. Sansa could feel the sharpness of the steel. \u201cI killed my first man at twelve. I\u2019ve lost count of how many I\u2019ve killed since then. High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, knights puffed up like bladders with their honors, yes, and women and children too\u2014they\u2019re all meat, and I\u2019m the butcher. Let them have their lands and their gods and their gold. Let them have their sers.\u201d Sandor Clegane spat at her feet to show what he thought of that. \u201cSo long as I have this,\u201d he said, lifting the sword from her throat, \u201cthere\u2019s no man on earth I need fear.\u201d\nExcept your brother, Sansa thought, but she had better sense than to say it aloud. He is a dog, just as he says. A half-wild, mean-tempered dog that bites any hand that tries to pet him, and yet will savage any man who tries to hurt his masters. \u201cNot even the men across the river?\u201d\nClegane\u2019s eyes turned toward the distant fires. \u201cAll this burning.\u201d He sheathed his sword. \u201cOnly cowards fight with fire.\u201d\n\u201cLord Stannis is no coward.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the man his brother was either. Robert never let a little thing like a river stop him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you do when he crosses?\u201d\n\u201cFight. Kill. Die, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid? The gods might send you down to some terrible hell for all the evil you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cWhat evil?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat gods?\u201d\n\u201cThe gods who made us all.\u201d\n\u201cAll?\u201d he mocked. \u201cTell me, little bird, what kind of god makes a monster like the Imp, or a halfwit like Lady Tanda\u2019s daughter? If there are gods, they made sheep so wolves could eat mutton, and they made the weak for the strong to play with.\u201d\n\u201cTrue knights protect the weak.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cThere are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can\u2019t protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don\u2019t ever believe any different.\u201d\nSansa backed away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re awful.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m honest. It\u2019s the world that\u2019s awful. Now fly away, little bird, I\u2019m sick of you peeping at me.\u201d\nWordless, she fled. She was afraid of Sandor Clegane\u2026 and yet, some part of her wished that Ser Dontos had a little of the Hound\u2019s ferocity. There are gods, she told herself, and there are true knights too. All the stories can\u2019t be lies.\nThat night Sansa dreamed of the riot again. The mob surged around her, shrieking, a maddened beast with a thousand faces. Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they dragged her from her horse all the same. \u201cNo,\u201d she cried, \u201cno, please, don\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u201d but no one paid her any heed. She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard. Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel. The knife plunged into her belly and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons.\nWhen she woke, the pale light of morning was slanting through her window, yet she felt as sick and achy as if she had not slept at all. There was something sticky on her thighs. When she threw back the blanket and saw the blood, all she could think was that her dream had somehow come true. She remembered the knives inside her, twisting and ripping. She squirmed away in horror, kicking at the sheets and falling to the floor, breathing raggedly, naked, bloodied, and afraid.\nBut as she crouched there, on her hands and knees, understanding came. \u201cNo, please,\u201d Sansa whimpered, \u201cplease, no.\u201d She didn\u2019t want this happening to her, not now, not here, not now, not now, not now, not now.\nMadness took hold of her. Pulling herself up by the bedpost, she went to the basin and washed between her legs, scrubbing away all the stickiness. By the time she was done, the water was pink with blood. When her maidservants saw it they would know. Then she remembered the bedclothes. She rushed back to the bed and stared in horror at the dark red stain and the tale it told. All she could think was that she had to get rid of it, or else they\u2019d see. She couldn\u2019t let them see, or they\u2019d marry her to Joffrey and make her lay with him.\nSnatching up her knife, Sana hacked at the sheet, cutting out the stain. If they ask me about the hole, what will I say? Tears ran down her face. She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I\u2019ll have to burn them. She balled up the evidence, stuffed it in the fireplace, drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. Then she realized that the blood had soaked through the sheet into the featherbed, so she bundled that up as well, but it was big and cumbersome, hard to move. Sansa could get only half of it into the fire. She was on her knees, struggling to shove the mattress into the flames as thick grey smoke eddied around her and filled the room, when the door burst open and she heard her maid gasp.\nIn the end it took three of them to pull her away. And it was all for nothing. The bedclothes were burnt, but by the time they carried her off her thighs were bloody again. It was as if her own body had betrayed her to Joffrey, unfurling a banner of Lannister crimson for all the world to see.\nWhen the fire was out, they carried off the singed featherbed, fanned away the worst of the smoke, and brought up a tub. Women came and went, muttering and looking at her strangely. They filled the tub with scalding hot water, bathed her and washed her hair and gave her a cloth to wear between her legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for her folly. The smoke had ruined most of her clothing. One of the women went away and came back with a green wool shift that was almost her size. \u201cIt\u2019s not as pretty as your own things, but it will serve,\u201d she announced when she\u2019d pulled it down over Sansa\u2019s head. \u201cYour shoes weren\u2019t burned, so at least you won\u2019t need to go barefoot to the queen.\u201d\nCersei Lannister was breaking her fast when Sansa was ushered into her solar. \u201cYou may sit,\u201d the queen said graciously. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d She gestured at the table. There was porridge, honey, milk, boiled eggs, and crisp fried fish.\nThe sight of the food made Sansa feel ill. Her tummy was tied in a knot. \u201cNo, thank you, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. Between Tyrion and Lord Stannis, everything I eat tastes of ash. And now you\u2019re setting fires as well. What did you hope to accomplish?\u201d\nSansa lowered her head. \u201cThe blood frightened me.\u201d\n\u201cThe blood is the seal of your womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You\u2019ve had your first flowering, no more.\u201d\nSansa had never felt less flowery. \u201cMy lady mother told me, but I\u2026 I thought it would be different.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Less\u2026 less messy, and more magical.\u201d\nQueen Cersei laughed. \u201cWait until you birth a child, Sansa. A woman\u2019s life is nine parts mess to one part magic, you\u2019ll learn that soon enough\u2026 and the parts that look like magic often turn out to be messiest of all.\u201d She took a sip of milk. \u201cSo now you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?\u201d\n\u201cIt means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,\u201d said Sansa, \u201cand to bear children for the king.\u201d\nThe queen gave a wry smile. \u201cA prospect that no longer entices you as it once did, I can see. I will not fault you for that. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth\u2026 I labored a day and a half to bring him forth. You cannot imagine the pain, Sansa. I screamed so loudly that I fancied Robert might hear me in the kingswood.\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace was not with you?\u201d\n\u201cRobert? Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and hounds. When he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stag\u2019s head, and I would present him with a baby.\n\u201cNot that I wanted him to stay, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle and an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he was not allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which of them proposed to keep him out.\n\u201cJoffrey will show you no such devotion, I fear. You could thank your sister for that, if she weren\u2019t dead. He\u2019s never been able to forget that day on the Trident when you saw her shame him, so he shames you in turn. You\u2019re stronger than you seem, though. I expect you\u2019ll survive a bit of humiliation. I did. You may never love the king, but you\u2019ll love his children.\u201d\n\u201cI love His Grace with all my heart,\u201d Sansa said.\nThe queen sighed. \u201cYou had best learn some new lies, and quickly. Lord Stannis will not like that one, I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cThe new High Septon said that the gods will never permit Lord Stannis to win, since Joffrey is the rightful king.\u201d\nA half smile flickered across the queen\u2019s face. \u201cRobert\u2019s trueborn son and heir. Though Joff would cry whenever Robert picked him up. His Grace did not like that. His bastards had always gurgled at him happily, and sucked his finger when he put it in their little baseborn mouths. Robert wanted smiles and cheers, always, so he went where he found them, to his friends and his whores. Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone wants to be loved.\u201d\n\u201cI see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.\u201d",

      "content": "Jon\nIt was dark in the Skirling Pass. The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so they rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air. Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons. Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now.\nThe track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward. Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand. It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night\u2019s Watch.\nGhost padded restlessly by Jon\u2019s side. From time to time he would stop and turn, his ears pricked, as if he heard something behind them. Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men, not unless they were starving, but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so.\nA wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass. Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater. Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again. \u201cShadows are friends to men in black,\u201d he said.\nJon saw the sense of that. It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but they dared not. Where there were three watchers there might be others, waiting to sound the alarm.\nStonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once. Jon shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses. Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes. Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, \u201cyou never asked me how it went. With the girl.\u201d\n\u201cI am no lord, Jon Snow.\u201d Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his two-fingered hand.\n\u201cShe told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.\u201d\n\u201cShe told you true.\u201d\n\u201cShe even claimed we were kin. She told me a story\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell. So Stonesnake told me. It happens I know the song. Mance would sing it of old, when he came back from a ranging. He had a passion for wildling music. Aye, and for their women as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew him?\u201d\n\u201cWe all knew him.\u201d His voice was sad.\nThey were friends as well as brothers, Jon realized, and now they are sworn foes. \u201cWhy did he desert?\u201d\n\u201cFor a wench, some say. For a crown, others would have it.\u201d Qhorin tested the edge of his sword with the ball of his thumb. \u201cHe liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man whose knees bent easily, that\u2019s true. But it was more than that. He loved the wild better than the Wall. It was in his blood. He was wildling born, taken as a child when some raiders were put to the sword. When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again.\u201d\n\u201cWas he a good ranger?\u201d\n\u201cHe was the best of us,\u201d said the Halfhand, \u201cand the worst as well. Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings. They are as brave as we are, Jon. As strong, as quick, as clever. But they have no discipline. They name themselves the free folk, and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester. Mance was the same. He never learned how to obey.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than me,\u201d said Jon quietly.\nQhorin\u2019s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him. \u201cSo you let her go?\u201d He did not sound the least surprised.\n\u201cYou know?\u201d\n\u201cNow. Tell me why you spared her.\u201d\nIt was hard to put into words. \u201cMy father never used a headsman. He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words. And when I looked into Ygritte\u2019s eyes, I\u2026\u201d Jon stared down at his hands helplessly. \u201cI know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in her.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than in the other two.\u201d\n\u201cIt was their lives or ours Jon said. \u201cIf they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.\u201d\n\u201cStonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygritte\u2019s knife and axe. She\u2019s behind us, afoot, unarmed\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd not like to be a threat,\u201d Qhorin agreed. \u201cIf I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you command it of me?\u201d\n\u201cI did not command it. I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be.\u201d Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard. \u201cWhen I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake. Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge. Ebben can make any man give up his secrets. To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow. I know more of you now than I did this morning.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I had slain her?\u201d asked Jon.\n\u201cShe would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before. But enough talk. You ought be sleeping. We have leagues to go, and dangers to face. You will need your strength.\u201d\nJon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right. He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket. \u201cGhost,\u201d he called. \u201cHere. To me.\u201d He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur. This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him. Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone. He wants to hunt, Jon thought. Perhaps there were goats in these mountains. The shadowcats must live on something. \u201cJust don\u2019t try and bring down a \u2019cat,\u201d he muttered. Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous. He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.\nWhen he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.\nThere were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others. He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness. The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost. His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent. He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound. As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.\nJon?\nThe call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too. Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only\u2026\nA weirwood.\nIt seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky. Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face. Red eyes looked at him. Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him. The weirwood had his brother\u2019s face. Had his brother always had three eyes?\nNot always, came the silent shout. Not before the crow.\nHe sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible. Death, he knew. He was smelling death. He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.\nDon\u2019t be afraid, I like it in the dark. No one can see you, but you can see them. But first you have to open your eyes. See? Like this. And the tree reached down and touched him.\nAnd suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice. Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.\nA vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black. Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it. There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host. Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war. He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants. The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind. Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines. Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth. He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion. Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.\nThis is no army, no more than it is a town. This is a whole people come together.\nAcross the long lake, one of the mounds moved. He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived. And the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man.\nThen a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings. As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky. A shrill scream split the air. He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun\u2026\n\u201cGhost!\u201d Jon shouted, sitting up. He could still feel the talons, the pain. \u201cGhost, to me!\u201d\nEbben appeared, grabbed him, shook him. \u201cQuiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down on us? What\u2019s wrong with you, boy?\u201d\n\u201cA dream,\u201d said Jon feebly. \u201cI was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river, and something attacked me. A bird\u2026 an eagle, I think\u2026\u201d\nSquire Dalbridge smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s always pretty women in my dreams. Would that I dreamed more often.\u201d\nQhorin came up beside him. \u201cA frozen river, you say?\u201d\n\u201cThe Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier,\u201d Stonesnake put in.\n\u201cThere was a tree with my brother\u2019s face. The wildlings\u2026 there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed. And giants riding mammoths.\u201d From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours. His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him. But that was in the dream.\n\u201cTell me all that you remember, from first to last,\u201d said Qhorin Halfhand.\nJon was confused. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\u201cA wolf dream,\u201d the Halfhand said. \u201cCraster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater. That may be why you dreamed it. Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on. Tell me.\u201d It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded. None of the black brothers laughed at him, however. By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.\n\u201cSkinchanger?\u201d said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand. Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered. Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan\u2019s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life. Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not hard to believe.\n\u201cThe cold winds are rising. Mormont feared as much. Benjen Stark felt it as well. Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again. Why should we balk at wargs and giants?\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean my dreams are true as well?\u201d asked Squire Dalbridge. \u201cLord Snow can keep his mammoths, I want my women.\u201d\n\u201cMan and boy I\u2019ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any,\u201d said Ebben. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more. I want to see them with my own eyes.\u201d\n\u201cBe careful they don\u2019t see you, Ebben,\u201d Stonesnake said.\nGhost did not reappear as they set out again. The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop. If the dream was true\u2026 Even the thought scared him. Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with his brother\u2019s face, that smelled of death and darkness?\nThe last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop. Twilight filled the Skirling Pass. It seemed to grow colder almost at once. They were no longer climbing. In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply. It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock. It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost. It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked. Other things might be listening as well.\n\u201cQhorin,\u201d Squire Dalbridge called softly. \u201cThere. Look.\u201d\nThe eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening sky. We\u2019ve seen other eagles, Jon thought. That need not be the one I dreamed of.\nEven so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him. \u201cThe bird\u2019s well out of bowshot.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it watching us.\u201d\nThe squire shrugged. \u201cNor me, but you won\u2019t stop it. Only waste a good arrow.\u201d\nQhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time. \u201cWe press on,\u201d he finally said. The rangers resumed their descent.\nGhost, Jon wanted to shout, where are you?\nHe was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders. A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir. He was off his horse at once. As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head. His neck glistened wetly, but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him. The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck.\nQhorin Halfhand was standing over him. \u201cHow bad?\u201d\nAs if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet.\n\u201cThe wolf is strong,\u201d the ranger said. \u201cEbben, water. Stonesnake, your skin of wine. Hold him still, Jon.\u201d\nTogether they washed the caked blood from the direwolf\u2019s fur. Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted. By the time they\u2019d ripped a strip from Jon\u2019s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled. Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone. \u201cDo we press on?\u201d Stonesnake wanted to know.\nQhorin went to his garron. \u201cBack, not on.\u201d\n\u201cBack?\u201d Jon was taken by surprise.\n\u201cEagles have sharper eyes than men. We are seen. So now we run.\u201d The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle.\nThe other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue. One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home. \u201cGhost, come,\u201d he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.\nAll night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground. The wind grew stronger. Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron. Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, \u201cNo fire,\u201d and that was the end of that. They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again. Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other \u2019cats were giving answer. Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.\nIn the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay. \u201cWe are not far from the place the wildlings died,\u201d said Qhorin. \u201cFrom there, one man could hold a hundred. The right man.\u201d He looked at Squire Dalbridge.\nThe squire bowed his head. \u201cLeave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers.\u201d He stroked his longbow. \u201cAnd see my garron has an apple when you\u2019re home. He\u2019s earned it, poor beastie.\u201d\nHe\u2019s staying to die, Jon realized.\nQhorin clasped the squire\u2019s forearm with a gloved hand. \u201cIf the eagle flies down for a look at you\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026he\u2019ll sprout some new feathers.\u201d\nThe last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights.\nWhen dawn broke, Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue. Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told him to be quiet. \u201cListen.\u201d\nJon held his breath, and heard it. Far away and behind them, the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains.\n\u201cAnd now they come,\u201d said Qhorin.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nPod dressed him for his ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him his chain of office. Tyrion left it on the bedside table. His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King\u2019s Hand, and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further.\nVarys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, a little out of breath. \u201cYou had best read this at once.\u201d He held out a parchment in a soft white hand. \u201cA report from the north.\u201d\n\u201cGood news or bad?\u201d Tyrion asked.\n\u201cThat is not for me to judge.\u201d\nTyrion unrolled the parchment. He had to squint to read the words in the torchlit yard. \u201cGods be good,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBoth of them?\u201d\n\u201cI fear so, my lord. It is so sad. So grievous sad. And them so young and innocent.\u201d\nTyrion remembered how the wolves had howled when the Stark boy had fallen. Are they howling now, I wonder? \u201cHave you told anyone else?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNot as yet, though of course I must.\u201d\nHe rolled up the letter. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my sister.\u201d He wanted to see how she took the news. He wanted that very much.\nThe queen looked especially lovely that night. She wore a low-cut gown of deep green velvet that brought out the color of her eyes. Her golden hair tumbled across her bare shoulders, and around her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds. Tyrion waited until he had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at her. He said not a word. Cersei blinked at him innocently and took the parchment from his hand.\n\u201cI trust you\u2019re pleased,\u201d he said as she read. \u201cYou wanted the Stark boy dead, I believe.\u201d\nCersei made a sour face. \u201cIt was Jaime who threw him from that window, not me. For love, he said, as if that would please me. It was a stupid thing to do, and dangerous besides, but when did our sweet brother ever stop to think?\u201d\n\u201cThe boy saw you,\u201d Tyrion pointed out.\n\u201cHe was a child. I could have frightened him into silence.\u201d She looked at the letter thoughtfully. \u201cWhy must I suffer accusations every time some Stark stubs his toe? This was Greyjoy\u2019s work, I had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope Lady Catelyn believes that.\u201d\nHer eyes widened. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014kill Jaime? Why not? What would you do if Joffrey and Tommen were murdered?\u201d\n\u201cI still hold Sansa!\u201d the queen declared.\n\u201cWe still hold Sansa,\u201d he corrected her, \u201cand we had best take good care of her. Now where is this supper you\u2019ve promised me, sweet sister?\u201d\nCersei set a tasty table, that could not be denied. They started with a creamy chestnut soup, crusty hot bread, and greens dressed with apples and pine nuts. Then came lamprey pie, honeyed ham, buttered carrots, white beans and bacon, and roast swan stuffed with mushrooms and oysters. Tyrion was exceedingly courteous; he offered his sister the choice portions of every dish, and made certain he ate only what she did. Not that he truly thought she\u2019d poison him, but it never hurt to be careful.\nThe news about the Starks had soured her, he could see. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no word from Bitterbridge?\u201d she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of her dagger and ate it with small, delicate bites.\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never trusted Littlefinger. For enough coin, he\u2019d go over to Stannis in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\u201cStannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men. Nor would he make a comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr. This war has made for some queer bedfellows, I agree, but those two? No.\u201d\nAs he carved some slices off the ham, she said, \u201cWe have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig.\u201d\n\u201cA token of her love?\u201d\n\u201cA bribe. She begs leave to return to her castle. Your leave as well as mine. I suspect she fears you\u2019ll arrest her on the road, as you did Lord Gyles.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she plan to make off with the heir to the throne?\u201d Tyrion served his sister a cut of ham and took one for himself. \u201cI\u2019d sooner she remain. If she wants to feel safe, tell her to bring down her garrison from Stokeworth. As many men as she has.\u201d\n\u201cIf we need men so badly, why did you send away your savages?\u201d A certain testiness crept into Cersei\u2019s voice.\n\u201cIt was the best use I could have made of them,\u201d he told her truthfully. \u201cThey\u2019re fierce warriors, but not soldiers. In formal battle, discipline is more important than courage. They\u2019ve already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls.\u201d\nAs the swan was being served, the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the Antler Men. She seemed more annoyed than afraid. \u201cWhy are we plagued with so many treasons? What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches?\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cbut they think to be on the winning side\u2026 which makes them fools as well as traitors.\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain you\u2019ve found them all?\u201d\n\u201cVarys says so.\u201d The swan was too rich for his taste.\nA line appeared on Cersei\u2019s pale white brow, between those lovely eyes. \u201cYou put too much trust in that eunuch.\u201d\n\u201cHe serves me well.\u201d\n\u201cOr so he\u2019d have you believe. You think you\u2019re the only one he whispers secrets to? He gives each of us just enough to convince us that we\u2019d be helpless without him. He played the same game with me, when I first wed Robert. For years, I was convinced I had no truer friend at court, but now\u2026\u201d She studied his face for a moment. \u201cHe says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey.\u201d\nDamn Varys. \u201cI need Clegane for more important duties.\u201d\n\u201cNothing is more important than the life of the king.\u201d\n\u201cThe life of the king is not at risk. Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him, and Meryn Trant as well.\u201d They\u2019re good for nothing better. \u201cI need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties, to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater.\u201d\n\u201cJaime would lead the sorties himself.\u201d\n\u201cFrom Riverrun? That\u2019s quite a sortie.\u201d\n\u201cJoff\u2019s only a boy.\u201d\n\u201cA boy who wants to be part of this battle, and for once he\u2019s showing some sense. I don\u2019t intend to put him in the thick of the fighting, but he needs to be seen. Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother\u2019s skirts.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s thirteen, Tyrion.\u201d\n\u201cRemember Jaime at thirteen? If you want the boy to be his father\u2019s son, let him play the part. Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy, and he\u2019ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him at all times. If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling, I\u2019ll have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once.\u201d\nHe had thought that might reassure her, but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes. \u201cWill the city fall?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d But if it does, pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father to march to our relief.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lied to me before, Tyrion.\u201d\n\u201cAlways with good reason, sweet sister. I want amity between us as much as you do. I\u2019ve decided to release Lord Gyles.\u201d He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture. \u201cYou can have Ser Boros Blount back as well.\u201d\nThe queen\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cSer Boros can rot at Rosby,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Tommen\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014stays where he is. He\u2019s safer under Lord Jacelyn\u2019s protection than he would ever have been with Lord Gyles.\u201d\nServing men cleared away the swan, hardly touched. Cersei beckoned for the sweet. \u201cI hope you like blackberry tarts.\u201d\n\u201cI love all sorts of tarts.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve known that a long while. Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?\u201d\n\u201cAre we playing at riddles now? No.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a cock.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do you.\u201d And don\u2019t you just hate that, Cersei?\n\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m dangerous too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That worm between your legs does half your thinking.\u201d\nTyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers. He did not like his sister\u2019s smile. \u201cYes, and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave.\u201d\n\u201cAre you unwell, brother?\u201d She leaned forward, giving him a good look at the top of her breasts. \u201cSuddenly you appear somewhat flustered.\u201d\n\u201cFlustered?\u201d Tyrion glanced at the door. He thought he\u2019d heard something outside. He was beginning to regret coming here alone. \u201cYou\u2019ve never shown much interest in my cock before.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your cock that interests me, so much as what you stick it in. I don\u2019t depend on the eunuch for everything, as you do. I have my own ways of finding out things\u2026 especially things that people don\u2019t want me to know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\u201cOnly this\u2014I have your little whore.\u201d\nTyrion reached for his wine cup, buying a moment to gather his thoughts. \u201cI thought men were more to your taste.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet?\u201d When he gave her no answer she laughed and said, \u201cFather will be ever so relieved.\u201d\nHis belly felt as if it were full of eels. How had she found Shae? Had Varys betrayed him? Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse? \u201cWhy should you care who I choose to warm my bed?\u201d\n\u201cA Lannister always pays his debts,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King\u2019s Landing. You sold Myrcella, stole Tommen, and now you plot to have Joff killed. You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen.\u201d\nWell, I can\u2019t say the notion isn\u2019t tempting. \u201cThis is madness, Cersei. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.\u201d\n\u201cFor what? Your great prowess in battle?\u201d\n\u201cBronn\u2019s sellswords will never fight without me,\u201d he lied.\n\u201cOh, I think they will. It\u2019s your gold they love, not your impish wit. Have no fear, though, they won\u2019t be without you. I won\u2019t say I haven\u2019t thought of slitting your throat from time to time, but Jaime would never forgive me if I did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the whore?\u201d He would not call her by name. If I can convince her Shae means nothing to me, perhaps\u2026\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be treated gently enough, so long as no harm comes to my sons. If Joff should be killed, however, or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies, your little cunt will die more painfully than you can possibly imagine.\u201d\nShe truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew. \u201cThe boys are safe,\u201d he promised her wearily. \u201cGods be good, Cersei, they\u2019re my own blood! What sort of man do you take me for?\u201d\n\u201cA small and twisted one.\u201d\nTyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of his wine cup. What would Jaime do in my place? Kill the bitch, most likely, and worry about the consequences afterward. But Tyrion did not have a golden sword, nor the skill to wield one. He loved his brother\u2019s reckless wrath, but it was their lord father he must try and emulate. Stone, I must be stone, I must be Casterly Rock, hard and unmovable. If I fail this test, I had as lief seek out the nearest grotesquerie. \u201cFor all I know, you\u2019ve killed her already,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWould you like to see her? I thought you might.\u201d Cersei crossed the room and threw open the heavy oaken door. \u201cBring in my brother\u2019s whore.\u201d\nSer Osmund\u2019s brothers Osney and Osfryd were peas from the same pod, tall men with hooked noses, dark hair, and cruel smiles. She hung between them, eyes wide and white in her dark face. Blood trickled from her broken lip, and he could see bruises through her torn clothing. Her hands were bound with rope, and they\u2019d gagged her so she could not speak.\n\u201cYou said she wouldn\u2019t be hurt.\u201d\n\u201cShe fought.\u201d Unlike his brothers, Osney Kettleblack was clean-shaven, so the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks. \u201cGot claws like a shadowcat, this one.\u201d\n\u201cBruises heal,\u201d said Cersei in a bored tone. \u201cThe whore will live. So long as Joff does.\u201d\nTyrion wanted to laugh at her. It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but it would have given the game away. You\u2019ve lost, Cersei, and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed. All he needed to do was say the words.\nInstead he looked at the girl\u2019s face and said, \u201cYou swear you\u2019ll release her after the battle?\u201d\n\u201cIf you release Tommen, yes.\u201d\nHe pushed himself to his feet. \u201cKeep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think they can use her\u2026 well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways.\u201d His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; he\u2019d reached for his father\u2019s voice, and found it. \u201cWhatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes.\u201d If she thinks me such a monster, I\u2019ll play the part for her.\nCersei had not expected that. \u201cYou would not dare.\u201d\nTyrion made himself smile, slow and cold. Green and black, his eyes laughed at her. \u201cDare? I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d\nHis sister\u2019s hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out. Osfryd moved to her rescue. \u201cOne more step and I\u2019ll break her arm,\u201d the dwarf warned him. The man stopped. \u201cYou remember when I said you\u2019d never hit me again, Cersei?\u201d He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks. \u201cUntie her and remove that gag.\u201d\nThe rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands. She cried out in pain as the circulation returned. Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned. \u201cSweetling,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must be brave. I am sorry they hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019ll free me, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow. Her broken lips left a smear of blood on his forehead. A bloody kiss is more than I deserve, Tyrion thought. She would never have been hurt but for me.\nHer blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen. \u201cI have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm. You\u2019ve ended that. I will hurt you for this. I don\u2019t know how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you\u2019ll know the debt is paid.\u201d In war, his father had told him once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees. No matter that they\u2019re as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored; once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again. So it was with Cersei. \u201cGet out!\u201d was all the answer she could summon. \u201cGet out of my sight!\u201d\nTyrion bowed. \u201cGood night, then. And pleasant dreams.\u201d\nHe made his way back to the Tower of the Hand with a thousand armored feet marching through his skull. I ought to have seen this coming the first time I slipped through the back of Chataya\u2019s wardrobe. Perhaps he had not wanted to see. His legs were aching badly by the time he had made the climb. He sent Pod for a flagon of wine and pushed his way into his bedchamber.\nShae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed, nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of her breasts: a chain of linked golden hands, each clasping the next.\nTyrion had not expected her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nLaughing, she stroked the chain. \u201cI wanted some hands on my titties\u2026 but these little gold ones are cold.\u201d\nFor a moment he did know what to say. How could he tell her that another woman had taken the beating meant for her, and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey? He wiped Alayaya\u2019s blood from his brow with the heel of his hand. \u201cThe Lady Lollys\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s asleep. Sleep\u2019s all she ever wants to do, the great cow. She sleeps and she eats. Sometimes she falls asleep while she\u2019s eating. The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it, and I have to clean her.\u201d She made a disgusted face. \u201cAll they did was fuck her.\u201d\n\u201cHer mother says she\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\u201cShe has a baby in her belly, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nTyrion gazed around the room. Everything seemed much as he left it. \u201cHow did you enter? Show me the hidden door.\u201d\nShe gave a shrug. \u201cLord Varys made me wear a hood. I couldn\u2019t see, except\u2026 there was one place, I got a peep at the floor out the bottom of the hood. It was all tiles, you know, the kind that make a picture?\u201d\n\u201cA mosaic?\u201d\nShae nodded. \u201cThey were colored red and black. I think the picture was a dragon. Otherwise, everything was dark. We went down a ladder and walked a long ways, until I was all twisted around. Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate. I brushed against it when we went through. The dragon was past the gate. Then we went up another ladder, with a tunnel at the top. I had to stoop, and I think Lord Varys was crawling.\u201d\nTyrion made a round of the bedchamber. One of the sconces looked loose. He stood on his toes and tried to turn it. It revolved slowly, scraping against the stone wall. When it was upside down, the stub of the candle fell out. The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance. \u201cDoesn\u2019t m\u2019lord want to bed me?\u201d asked Shae.\n\u201cIn a moment.\u201d Tyrion threw open his wardrobe, shoved the clothing aside, and pushed against the rear panel. What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well\u2026 but no, the wood was solid, unyielding. A stone beside the window seat drew his eye, but all his tugging and prodding went for naught. He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed.\nShae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck. \u201cYour shoulders feel as hard as rocks,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHurry, I want to feel you inside me.\u201d Yet as her legs locked around his waist, his manhood left him. When she felt him go soft, Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in her mouth, but even that could not rouse him.\nAfter a few moments he stopped her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. All the sweet innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face.\nInnocence? Fool, she\u2019s a whore, Cersei was right, you think with your cock, fool, fool.\n\u201cJust go to sleep, sweetling,\u201d he urged, stroking her hair. Yet long after Shae had taken his advice, Tyrion himself still lay awake, his fingers cupped over one small breast as he listened to her breathing.",

      "content": "Catelyn\nThe Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper. Deep shadows draped the walls. One of the torches had guttered out, leaving only three. Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet. The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue. Brienne was across from her. Between them, her father\u2019s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall. Even the servants were gone. She had given them leave to join the celebration.\nThe walls of the keep were thick, yet even so, they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside. Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars, and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure\u2019s imminent return and Robb\u2019s conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale.\nI cannot blame them, Catelyn thought. They do not know. And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons. Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers. She stared at the supper set before her: trout wrapped in bacon, salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass, pease and onions and hot bread. Brienne was eating methodically, as if supper were another chore to be accomplished. I am become a sour woman, Catelyn thought. I take no joy in mead nor meat, and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me. I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings. There is an empty place within me where my heart was once.\nThe sound of the other woman\u2019s eating had become intolerable to her. \u201cBrienne, I am no fit company. Go join the revels, if you would. Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund\u2019s harping.\u201d\n\u201cI am not made for revels, my lady.\u201d Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread. Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were. \u201cIf you command it, I\u2026\u201d\nCatelyn could sense her discomfort. \u201cI only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m well content.\u201d The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout had been fried in.\n\u201cThere was another bird this morning.\u201d Catelyn did not know why she said it. \u201cThe maester woke me at once. That was dutiful, but not kind. Not kind at all.\u201d She had not meant to tell Brienne. No one knew but her and Maester Vyman, and she had meant to keep it that way until\u2026 until\u2026\nUntil what? Foolish woman, will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true? If you never tell, never speak of it, will it become only a dream, less than a dream, a nightmare half-remembered? Oh, if only the gods would be so good.\n\u201cIs it news of King\u2019s Landing?\u201d asked Brienne.\n\u201cWould that it was. The bird came from Castle Cerwyn, from Ser Rodrik, my castellan.\u201d Dark wings, dark words. \u201cHe has gathered what power he could and is marching on Winterfell, to take the castle back.\u201d How unimportant all that sounded now. \u201cBut he said\u2026 he wrote\u2026 he told me, he\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy lady, what is it? Is it some news of your sons?\u201d\nSuch a simple question that was; would that the answer could be as simple. When Catelyn tried to speak, the words caught in her throat. \u201cI have no sons but Robb.\u201d She managed those terrible words without a sob, and for that much she was glad.\nBrienne looked at her with horror. \u201cMy lady?\u201d\n\u201cBran and Rickon tried to escape, but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water. Theon Greyjoy has mounted their heads on the walls of Winterfell. Theon Greyjoy, who ate at my table since he was a boy of ten.\u201d I have said it, gods forgive me. I have said it and made it true.\nBrienne\u2019s face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn\u2019s, as if the touch might be unwelcome. \u201cI\u2026 there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they\u2026 they\u2019re with the gods now.\u201d\n\u201cAre they?\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cWhat god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran\u2026 when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again.\u201d She showed Brienne her palms, her fingers. \u201cThese scars\u2026 they sent a man to cut Bran\u2019s throat as he lay sleeping. He would have died then, and me with him, but Bran\u2019s wolf tore out the man\u2019s throat.\u201d That gave her a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cI suppose Theon killed the wolves too. He must have, elsewise\u2026 I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with them. Like Robb with his Grey Wind. But my daughters have no wolves now.\u201d\nThe abrupt shift of topic left Brienne bewildered. \u201cYour daughters\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft\u2026 the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.\n\u201cAnd Arya, well\u2026 Ned\u2019s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart\u2019s desire. She had Ned\u2019s long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. I think she must be dead too.\u201d When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest. \u201cI want them all dead, Brienne. Theon Greyjoy first, then Jaime Lannister and Cersei and the Imp, every one, every one. But my girls\u2026 my girls will\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe queen\u2026 she has a little girl of her own,\u201d Brienne said awkwardly. \u201cAnd sons too, of an age with yours. When she hears, perhaps she\u2026 she may take pity, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSend my daughters back unharmed?\u201d Catelyn smiled sadly. \u201cThere is a sweet innocence about you, child. I could wish\u2026 but no. Robb will avenge his brothers. Ice can kill as dead as fire. Ice was Ned\u2019s greatsword. Valyrian steel, marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings, so sharp I feared to touch it. Robb\u2019s blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice. It will not be easy for him to get Theon\u2019s head off, I fear. The Starks do not use headsmen. Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though he never took any joy in the duty. But I would, oh, yes.\u201d She stared at her scarred hands, opened and closed them, then slowly raised her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve sent him wine.\u201d\n\u201cWine?\u201d Brienne was lost. \u201cRobb? Or\u2026 Theon Greyjoy?\u201d\n\u201cThe Kingslayer.\u201d The ploy had served her well with Cleos Frey. I hope you\u2019re thirsty, Jaime. I hope your throat is dry and tight. \u201cI would like you to come with me.\u201d\n\u201cI am yours to command, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Catelyn rose abruptly. \u201cStay, finish your meal in peace. I will send for you later. At midnight.\u201d\n\u201cSo late, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cThe dungeons are windowless. One hour is much like another down there, and for me, all hours are midnight.\u201d Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall. As she climbed to Lord Hoster\u2019s solar, she could hear them outside, shouting, \u201cTully!\u201d and \u201cA cup! A cup to the brave young lord!\u201d My father is not dead, she wanted to shout down at them. My sons are dead, but my father lives, damn you all, and he is your lord still.\nLord Hoster was deep in sleep. \u201cHe had a cup of drearnwine not so long ago, my lady,\u201d Maester Vyman said. \u201cFor the pain. He will not know you are here.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes no matter,\u201d Catelyn said. He is more dead than alive, yet more alive than my poor sweet sons.\n\u201cMy lady, is there aught I might do for you? A sleeping draught, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Maester, but no. I will not sleep away my grief. Bran and Rickon deserve better from me. Go and join the celebration, I will sit with my father for a time.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, my lady.\u201d Vyman bowed and left her.\nLord Hoster lay on his back, mouth open, his breath a faint whistling sigh. One hand hung over the edge of the mattress, a pale frail fleshless thing, but warm when she touched it. She slid her fingers through his and closed them. No matter how tightly I hold him, I cannot keep him here, she thought sadly. Let him go. Yet her fingers would not seem to unbend.\n\u201cI have no one to talk with, Father,\u201d she told him. \u201cI pray, but the gods do not answer.\u201d Lightly she kissed his hand. The skin was warm, blue veins branching like rivers beneath his pale translucent skin. Outside the greater rivers flowed, the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, and they would flow forever, but not so the rivers in her father\u2019s hand. Too soon that current would grow still. \u201cLast night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard. Do you remember? That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party. Everything was grey, and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse. We lost the road. The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed. Lysa started to cry, and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound. But Petyr knew where we were, and he rode back and found us\u2026\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no one to find me now, is there? This time I have to find our own way, and it is hard, so hard.\n\u201cI keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want\u2026\u201d Catelyn hung her head. \u201cI want,\u201d she said once more, and then her words were gone.\nAfter a time the candle guttered and went out. Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters, laying pale silvery bars across her father\u2019s face. She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing, the endless rush of waters, the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard, so sad and sweet. \u201cI loved a maid as red as autumn,\u201d Rymund sang, \u201cwith sunset in her hair.\u201d\nCatelyn never noticed when the singing ended. Hours had passed, yet it seemed only a heartbeat before Brienne was at the door. \u201cMy lady,\u201d she announced softly. \u201cMidnight has come.\u201d\nMidnight has come, Father, she thought, and I must do my duty. She let go of his hand.\nThe gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose. They found him bent over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie, more than a little drunk. He squinted at them suspiciously. \u201cBegging your forgiveness, m\u2019lady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.\u201d\n\u201cLord Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?\u201d\nThe gaoler licked his lips. \u201cNo, m\u2019lady, not as I knows.\u201d\n\u201cYou will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hoster\u2019s solar and tell him why you saw fit to defy me.\u201d\nHis eyes fell. \u201cAs m\u2019lady says.\u201d The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that girdled his waist. He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them, until he found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer\u2019s cell.\n\u201cGo back to your ale and leave us,\u201d she commanded. An oil lamp hung from a hook on the low ceiling. Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame. \u201cBrienne, see that I am not disturbed.\u201d\nNodding, Brienne took up a position just outside the cell, her hand resting on the pommel of her sword. \u201cMy lady will call if she has need of me.\u201d\nCatelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness. This was the bowels of Riverrun, and smelled the part. Old straw crackled underfoot. The walls were discolored with patches of nitre. Through the stone, she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone. The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a huddled shape in another. The flagon of wine stood beside the door, untouched. So much for that ploy. I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself, I suppose.\nJaime raised his hands to cover his face, the chains around his wrists clanking. \u201cLady Stark,\u201d he said, in a voice hoarse with disuse. \u201cI fear I am in no condition to receive you.\u201d\n\u201cLook at me, ser.\u201d\n\u201cThe light hurts my eyes. A moment, if you would.\u201d Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered his face, once so like the queen\u2019s. Glinting gold in the lamplight, the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast, magnificent even in chains. His unwashed hair fell to his shoulders in ropes and tangles, the clothes were rotting on his body, his face was pale and wasted\u2026 and even so, the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent.\n\u201cI see you had no taste for the wine I sent you.\u201d\n\u201cSuch sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect.\u201d\n\u201cI can have your head off anytime I want. Why would I need to poison you?\u201d\n\u201cDeath by poison can seem natural. Harder to claim that my head simply fell off.\u201d He squinted up from the floor, his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light. \u201cI\u2019d invite you to sit, but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair.\u201d\n\u201cI can stand well enough.\u201d\n\u201cCan you? You look terrible, I must say. Though perhaps it\u2019s just the light in here.\u201d He was fettered at wrist and ankle, each cuff chained to the others, so he could neither stand nor lie comfortably. The ankle chains were bolted to the wall. \u201cAre my bracelets heavy enough for you, or did you come to add a few more? I\u2019ll rattle them prettily if you like.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought this on yourself,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWe granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting your birth and station. You repaid us by trying to escape.\u201d\n\u201cA cell is a cell. Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden. One day perhaps I\u2019ll show them to you.\u201d\nIf he is cowed, he hides it well, Catelyn thought. \u201cA man chained hand and foot should keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth, ser. I did not come here to be threatened.\u201d\n\u201cNo? Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me? It\u2019s said that widows grow weary of their empty beds. We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed, but I suppose I could still service you if that\u2019s what you need. Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and we\u2019ll see if I\u2019m up to it.\u201d\nCatelyn stared down at him in revulsion. Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one? \u201cIf you said that in my son\u2019s hearing, he would kill you for it.\u201d\n\u201cOnly so long as I was wearing these.\u201d Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her. \u201cWe both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat.\u201d\n\u201cMy son may be young, but if you take him for a fool, you are sadly mistaken\u2026 and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back.\u201d\n\u201cDid the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers\u2019 skirts as well?\u201d\n\u201cI grow weary of this, ser. There are things I must know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I tell you anything?\u201d\n\u201cTo save your life.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I fear death?\u201d That seemed to amuse him.\n\u201cYou should. Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.\u201d\n\u201cWhat gods are those, Lady Catelyn? The trees your husband prayed to? How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off?\u201d Jaime gave a chuckle. \u201cIf there are gods, why is the world so full of pain and injustice?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of men like you.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no men like me. There\u2019s only me.\u201d\nThere is nothing here but arrogance and pride, and the empty courage of a madman. I am wasting my breath with this one. If there was ever a spark of honor in him, it is long dead. \u201cIf you will not speak with me, so be it. Drink the wine or piss in it, ser, it makes no matter to me.\u201d\nHer hand was at the door pull when he said, \u201cLady Stark.\u201d She turned, waited. \u201cThings go to rust in this damp,\u201d Jaime went on. \u201cEven a man\u2019s courtesies. Stay, and you shall have your answers\u2026 for a price.\u201d\nHe has no shame. \u201cCaptives do not set prices.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll find mine modest enough. Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies, and he cannot even keep them straight. One day he says Cersei has been flayed, and the next it\u2019s my father. Answer my questions and I\u2019ll answer yours.\u201d\n\u201cTruthfully?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s truth you want? Be careful, my lady. Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it\u2019s served up.\u201d\n\u201cI am strong enough to hear anything you care to say.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, then. But first, if you\u2019d be so kind\u2026 the wine. My throat is raw.\u201d\nCatelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer. Jaime sloshed the wine around his mouth before he swallowed. \u201cSour and vile,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will do.\u201d He put his back to the wall, drew his knees up to his chest, and stared at her. \u201cYour first question, Lady Catelyn?\u201d\nNot knowing how long this game might continue, Catelyn wasted no time. \u201cAre you Joffrey\u2019s father?\u201d\n\u201cYou would never ask unless you knew the answer.\u201d\n\u201cI want it from your own lips.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cJoffrey is mine. As are the rest of Cersei\u2019s brood, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cYou admit to being your sister\u2019s lover?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved my sister, and you owe me two answers. Do all my kin still live?\u201d\n\u201cSer Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross, I am told.\u201d\nJaime was unmoved. \u201cUncle Dolt, my sister called him. it\u2019s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me. As well as my lord father.\u201d\n\u201cThey live, all three.\u201d But not long, if the gods are good.\nJaime drank some more wine. \u201cAsk your next.\u201d\nCatelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie. \u201cHow did my son Bran come to fall?\u201d\n\u201cI flung him from a window.\u201d\nThe easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant. If I had a knife, I would kill him now, she thought, until she remembered the girls. Her throat constricted as she said, \u201cYou were a knight, sworn to defend the weak and innocent.\u201d\n\u201cHe was weak enough, but perhaps not so innocent. He was spying on us.\u201d\n\u201cBran would not spy.\u201d\n\u201cThen blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see.\u201d\n\u201cBlame the gods?\u201d she said, incredulous. \u201cYours was the hand that threw him. You meant for him to die.\u201d\nHis chains chinked softly. \u201cI seldom fling children from towers to improve their health. Yes, I meant for him to die.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when he did not, you knew your danger was worse than ever, so you gave your catspaw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake.\u201d\n\u201cDid I now?\u201d Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow. \u201cI won\u2019t deny we talked of it, but you were with the boy day and night, your maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently, and there were guards, even those damned direwolves\u2026 it would have required cutting my way through half of Winterfell. And why bother, when the boy seemed like to die of his own accord?\u201d\n\u201cIf you lie to me, this session is at an end.\u201d Catelyn held out her hands, to show him her fingers and palms. \u201cThe man who came to slit Bran\u2019s throat gave me these scars. You swear you had no part in sending him?\u201d\n\u201cOn my honor as a Lannister.\u201d\n\u201cYour honor as a Lannister is worth less than this.\u201d She kicked over the waste pail. Foul-smelling brown ooze crept across the floor of the cell, soaking into the straw.\nJaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow. \u201cI may indeed have shit for honor, I won\u2019t deny it, but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing. Believe what you will, Lady Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.\u201d\nGods be merciful, he\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cIf you did not send the killer, your sister did.\u201d\n\u201cIf so, I\u2019d know. Cersei keeps no secrets from me.\u201d\n\u201cThen it was the Imp.\u201d\n\u201cTyrion is as innocent as your Bran. He wasn\u2019t climbing around outside of anyone\u2019s window, spying.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did the assassin have his dagger?\u201d\n\u201cWhat dagger was this?\u201d\n\u201cIt was so long,\u201d she said, holding her hands apart, \u201cplain, but finely made, with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt. Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey\u2019s name day.\u201d\nLannister poured, drank, poured, and stared into his wine cup. \u201cThis wine seems to be improving as I drink it. Imagine that. I seem to remember that dagger, now that you describe it. Won it, you say? How?\u201d\n\u201cWagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers.\u201d Yet when she heard her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong. \u201cNo\u2026 was it the other way?\u201d\n\u201cTyrion always backed me in the lists,\u201d Jaime said, \u201cbut that day Ser Loras unhorsed me. A mischance, I took the boy too lightly, but no matter. Whatever my brother wagered, he lost\u2026 but that dagger did change hands, I recall it now. Robert showed it to me that night at the feast. His Grace loved to salt my wounds, especially when drunk. And when was he not drunk?\u201d\nTyrion Lannister had said much the same thing as they rode through the Mountains of the Moon, Catelyn remembered. She had refused to believe him. Petyr had sworn otherwise, Petyr who had been almost a brother, Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her hand\u2026 and yet if Jaime and Tyrion told the same tale, what did that mean? The brothers had not seen each other since departing Winterfell more than a year ago. \u201cAre you trying to deceive me?\u201d Somewhere there was a trap here.\n\u201cI\u2019ve admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window, what would it gain me to lie about this knife?\u201d He tossed down another cup of wine. \u201cBelieve what you will, I\u2019m past caring what people say of me. And it\u2019s my turn. Have Robert\u2019s brothers taken the field?\u201d\n\u201cThey have.\u201d\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a niggardly response. Give me more than that, or your next answer will be as poor.\u201d\n\u201cStannis marches against King\u2019s Landing,\u201d she said grudgingly. \u201cRenly is dead, murdered at Bitterbridge by his brother, through some black art I do not understand.\u201d\n\u201cA pity,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cI rather liked Renly, though Stannis is quite another tale. What side have the Tyrells taken?\u201d\n\u201cRenly, at first. Now, I could not say.\u201d\n\u201cYour boy must be feeling lonely.\u201d\n\u201cRobb was sixteen a few days past\u2026 a man grown, and a king. He\u2019s won every battle he\u2019s fought. The last word we had from him, he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t faced my father yet, has he?\u201d\n\u201cWhen he does, he\u2019ll defeat him. As he did you.\u201d\n\u201cHe took me unawares. A craven\u2019s trick.\u201d\n\u201cYou dare talk of tricks? Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoy\u2019s garb, under a peace banner.\u201d\n\u201cIf it were one of your sons in this cell, wouldn\u2019t his brothers do as much for him?\u201d\nMy son has no brothers, she thought, but she would not share her pain with a creature such as this.\nJaime drank some more wine. \u201cWhat\u2019s a brother\u2019s life when honor is at stake, eh?\u201d Another sip. \u201cTyrion is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom me.\u201d\nCatelyn could not deny it. \u201cRobb\u2019s bannermen would sooner see you dead. Rickard Karstark in particular. You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood.\u201d\n\u201cThe two with the white sunburst, were they?\u201d Jaime gave a shrug. \u201cIf truth be told, it was your son that I was trying to slay. The others got in my way. I killed them in fair fight, in the heat of battle. Any other knight would have done the same.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you still count yourself a knight, when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore?\u201d\nJaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup. \u201cSo many vows\u2026 they make you swear and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It\u2019s too much. No matter what you do, you\u2019re forsaking one vow or the other.\u201d He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed his eyes for an instant, leaning his head back against the patch of nitre on the wall. \u201cI was the youngest man ever to wear the white cloak.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the youngest to betray all it stood for, Kingslayer.\u201d\n\u201cKingslayer,\u201d he pronounced carefully. \u201cAnd such a king he was!\u201d He lifted his cup. \u201cTo Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. And to the sword that opened his throat. A golden sword, don\u2019t you know. Until his blood ran red down the blade. Those are the Lannister colors, red and gold.\u201d\nAs he laughed, she realized the wine had done its work; Jaime had drained most of the flagon, and he was drunk. \u201cOnly a man like you would be proud of such an act.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, there are no men like me. Answer me this, Lady Stark\u2014did your Ned ever tell you the manner of his father\u2019s death? Or his brother\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cThey strangled Brandon while his father watched, and then killed Lord Rickard as well.\u201d An ugly tale, and sixteen years old. Why was he asking about it now?\n\u201cKilled, yes, but how?\u201d\n\u201cThe cord or the axe, I suppose.\u201d\nJaime took a swallow, wiped his mouth. \u201cNo doubt Ned wished to spare you. His sweet young bride, if not quite a maiden. Well, you wanted truth. Ask me. We made a bargain, I can deny you nothing. Ask.\u201d\n\u201cDead is dead.\u201d I do not want to know this.\n\u201cBrandon was different from his brother, wasn\u2019t he? He had blood in his veins instead of cold water. More like me.\u201d\n\u201cBrandon was nothing like you.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so. You and he were to wed.\u201d\n\u201cHe was on his way to Riverrun when\u2026\u201d Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years. \u201c\u2026when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King\u2019s Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do.\u201d She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.\nJaime poured the last half cup of wine. \u201cHe rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die. But Rhaegar wasn\u2019t there. Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son\u2019s murder. The others were lords\u2019 sons too, it seems to me.\u201d\n\u201cEthan Glover was Brandon\u2019s squire,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cHe was the only one to survive. The others were Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn, Jon Arryn\u2019s nephew and heir.\u201d It was queer how she still remembered the names, after so many years. \u201cAerys accused them of treason and summoned their fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as hostages. When they came, he had them murdered without trial. Fathers and sons both.\u201d\n\u201cThere were trials. Of a sort. Lord Rickard demanded trial by combat, and the king granted the request. Stark armored himself as for battle, thinking to duel one of the Kingsguard. Me, perhaps. Instead they took him to the throne room and suspended him from the rafters while two of Aerys\u2019s pyromancers kindled a blaze beneath him. The king told him that fire was the champion of House Targaryen. So all Lord Rickard needed to do to prove himself innocent of treason was\u2026 well, not burn.\n\u201cWhen the fire was blazing, Brandon was brought in. His hands were chained behind his back, and around his neck was a wet leathern cord attached to a device the king had brought from Tyrosh. His legs were left free, though, and his longsword was set down just beyond his reach.\n\u201cThe pyromancers roasted Lord Rickard slowly, banking and fanning that fire carefully to get a nice even heat. His cloak caught first, and then his surcoat, and soon he wore nothing but metal and ashes. Next he would start to cook, Aerys promised\u2026 unless his son could free him. Brandon tried, but the more he struggled, the tighter the cord constricted around his throat. In the end he strangled himself.\n\u201cAs for Lord Rickard, the steel of his breastplate turned cherry-red before the end, and his gold melted off his spurs and dripped down into the fire. I stood at the foot of the Iron Throne in my white armor and white cloak, filling my head with thoughts of Cersei. After, Gerold Hightower himself took me aside and said to me, \u2018You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him.\u2019 That was the White Bull, loyal to the end and a better man than me, all agree.\u201d\n\u201cAerys\u2026\u201d Catelyn could taste bile at the back of her throat. The story was so hideous she suspected it had to be true. \u201cAerys was mad, the whole realm knew it, but if you would have me believe you slew him to avenge Brandon Stark\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI made no such claim. The Starks were nothing to me. I will say, I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did, and reviled by so many for my finest act. At Robert\u2019s coronation, I was made to kneel at the royal feet beside Grand Maester Pycelle and Varys the eunuch, so that he might forgive us our crimes before he took us into his service. As for your Ned, he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert\u2019s throne. I think Ned Stark loved Robert better than he ever loved his brother or his father\u2026 or even you, my lady. He was never unfaithful to Robert, was he?\u201d Jaime gave a drunken laugh. \u201cCome, Lady Stark, don\u2019t you find this all terribly amusing?\u201d\n\u201cI find nothing about you amusing, Kingslayer.\u201d\n\u201cThat name again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll fuck you after all, Littlefinger had you first, didn\u2019t he? I never eat off another man\u2019s trencher. Besides, you\u2019re not half so lovely as my sister.\u201d His smile cut. \u201cI\u2019ve never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, I have been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? What was the name of that bastard he fathered?\u201d\nCatelyn took a step backward. \u201cBrienne.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t it.\u201d Jaime Lannister upended the flagon. A trickle ran down onto his face, bright as blood. \u201cSnow, that was the one. Such a white name\u2026 like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.\u201d\nBrienne pushed open the door and stepped inside the cell. \u201cYou called, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cGive me your sword.\u201d Catelyn held out her hand.",

      "content": "Theon\nThe sky was a gloom of cloud, the woods dead and frozen. Roots grabbed at Theon\u2019s feet as he ran, and bare branches lashed his face, leaving thin stripes of blood across his cheeks. He crashed through heedless, breathless, icicles flying to pieces before him. Mercy, he sobbed. From behind came a shuddering howl that curdled his blood. Mercy, mercy. When he glanced back over his shoulder he saw them coming, great wolves the size of horses with the heads of small children. Oh, mercy, mercy. Blood dripped from their mouths black as pitch, burning holes in the snow where it fell. Every stride brought them closer. Theon tried to run faster, but his legs would not obey. The trees all had faces, and they were laughing at him, laughing, and the howl came again. He could smell the hot breath of the beasts behind him, a stink of brimstone and corruption. They\u2019re dead, dead, I saw them killed, he tried to shout, I saw their heads dipped in tar, but when he opened his mouth only a moan emerged, and then something touched him and he whirled, shouting\u2026\n\u2026flailing for the dagger he kept by his bedside and managing only to knock it to the floor. Wex danced away from him. Reek stood behind the mute, his face lit from below by the candle he carried. \u201cWhat?\u201d Theon cried. Mercy. \u201cWhat do you want? Why are you in my bedchamber? Why?\u201d\n\u201cMy lord prince,\u201d said Reek, \u201cyour sister has come to Winterfell. You asked to be informed at once if she arrived.\u201d\n\u201cPast time,\u201d Theon muttered, pushing his fingers through his hair. He had begun to fear that Asha meant to leave him to his fate. Mercy. He glanced outside the window, where the first vague light of dawn was just brushing the towers of Winterfell. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\u201cLorren took her and her men to the Great Hall to break their fast. Will you see her now?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Theon pushed off the blankets. The fire had burned down to embers. \u201cWex, hot water.\u201d He could not let Asha see him disheveled and soaked with sweat. Wolves with children\u2019s faces\u2026 He shivered. \u201cClose the shutters.\u201d The bedchamber felt as cold as the dream forest had been.\nAll his dreams had been cold of late, and each more hideous than the one before. Last night he had dreamed himself back in the mill again, on his knees dressing the dead. Their limbs were already stiffening, so they seemed to resist sullenly as he fumbled at them with half-frozen fingers, tugging up breeches and knotting laces, yanking fur-trimmed boots over hard unbending feet, buckling a studded leather belt around a waist no bigger than the span of his hands. \u201cThis was never what I wanted,\u201d he told them as he worked. \u201cThey gave me no choice.\u201d The corpses made no answer, but only grew colder and heavier.\nThe night before, it had been the miller\u2019s wife. Theon had forgotten her name, but he remembered her body, soft pillowy breasts and stretch marks on her belly, the way she clawed his back when he fucked her. Last night in his dream he had been in bed with her once again, but this time she had teeth above and below, and she tore out his throat even as she was gnawing off his manhood. It was madness. He\u2019d seen her die too. Gelmarr had cut her down with one blow of his axe as she cried to Theon for mercy. Leave me, woman. It was him who killed you, not me. And he\u2019s dead as well. At least Gelmarr did not haunt Theon\u2019s sleep.\nThe dream had receded by the time Wex returned with the water. Theon washed the sweat and sleep from his body and took his own good time dressing. Asha had let him wait long enough; now it was her turn. He chose a satin tunic striped black and gold and a fine leather jerkin with silver studs\u2026 and only then remembered that his wretched sister put more stock in blades than beauty. Cursing, he tore off the clothes and dressed again, in felted black wool and ringmail. Around his waist he buckled sword and dagger, remembering the night she had humiliated him at his own father\u2019s table. Her sweet suckling babe, yes. Well, I have a knife too, and know how to use it.\nLast of all, he donned his crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold. It was misshapen and ugly, but there was no help for that. Mikken lay buried in the lichyard, and the new smith was capable of little more than nails and horseshoes. Theon consoled himself with the reminder that it was only a prince\u2019s crown. He would have something much finer when he was crowned king.\nOutside his door, Reek waited with Urzen and Kromm. Theon fell in with them. These days, he took guards with him everywhere he went, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted him dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken his back. The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give him warning should anyone try to steal up on his sleeping place. All the same, one morning the castle woke to the sound of the little dog barking wildly. They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating in it, drowned.\nHe could not let the killings go unpunished. Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so Theon sat in judgment, called him guilty, and condemned him to death. Even that went sour. As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, \u201cM\u2019lord Eddard always did his own killings.\u201d Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling. His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen\u2019s shoulders. It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they\u2019d sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting. I had no choice, he wanted to scream at the corpse. The ironborn can\u2019t keep secrets, they had to die, and someone had to take the blame for it. He only wished he had killed him cleaner. Ned Stark had never needed more than a single blow to take a man\u2019s head.\nThe killings stopped after Farlen\u2019s death, but even so his men continued sullen and anxious. \u201cThey fear no foe in open battle,\u201d Black Lorren told him, \u201cbut it is another thing to dwell among enemies, never knowing if the washerwoman means to kiss you or kill you, or whether the serving boy is filling your cup with ale or bale. We would do well to leave this place.\u201d\n\u201cI am the Prince of Winterfell!\u201d Theon had shouted. \u201cThis is my seat, no man will drive me from it. No, nor woman either!\u201d\nAsha. It was her doing. My own sweet sister, may the Others bugger her with a sword. She wanted him dead, so she could steal his place as their father\u2019s heir. That was why she had let him languish here, ignoring the urgent commands he had sent her.\nHe found her in the high seat of the Starks, ripping a capon apart with her fingers. The hall rang with the voices of her men, sharing stories with Theon\u2019s own as they drank together. They were so loud that his entrance went all but unnoticed. \u201cWhere are the rest?\u201d he demanded of Reek. There were no more than fifty men at the trestle tables, most of them his. Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall could have seated ten times the number.\n\u201cThis is the whole o\u2019 the company, m\u2019lord prince.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole\u2014how many men did she bring?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty, by my count.\u201d\nTheon Greyjoy strode to where his sister was sprawled. Asha was laughing at something one of her men had said, but broke off at his approach. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis the Prince of Winterfell.\u201d She tossed a bone to one of the dogs sniffing about the hall. Under that hawk\u2019s beak of a nose, her wide mouth twisted in a mocking grin. \u201cOr is it Prince of Fools?\u201d\n\u201cEnvy ill becomes a maid.\u201d\nAsha sucked grease from her fingers. A lock of black hair fell across her eyes. Her men were shouting for bread and bacon. They made a deal of noise, as few as they were. \u201cEnvy, Theon?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else would you call it? With thirty men, I captured Winterfell in a night. You needed a thousand and a moon\u2019s turn to take Deepwood Motte.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m no great warrior like you, brother,\u201d She quaffed half a horn of ale and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. \u201cI saw the heads above your gates. Tell me true, which one gave you the fiercest fight, the cripple or the babe?\u201d\nTheon could feel the blood rushing to his face. He took no joy from those heads, no more than he had in displaying the headless bodies of the children before the castle. Old Nan stood with her soft toothless mouth opening and closing soundlessly, and Farlen threw himself at Theon, snarling like one of his hounds. Urzen and Cadwyl had to beat him senseless with the butts of their spears. How did I come to this? he remembered thinking as he stood over the fly-speckled bodies.\nOnly Maester Luwin had the stomach to come near. Stone-faced, the small grey man had begged leave to sew the boys\u2019 heads back onto their shoulders, so they might be laid in the crypts below with the other Stark dead.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Theon had told him. \u201cNot the crypts.\u201d\n\u201cBut why, my lord? Surely they cannot harm you now. It is where they belong. All the bones of the Starks\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said no.\u201d He needed the heads for the wall, but he had burned the headless bodies that very day, in all their finery. Afterward he had knelt amongst the bones and ashes to retrieve a slag of melted silver and cracked jet, all that remained of the wolf\u2019s-head brooch that had once been Bran\u2019s. He had it still.\n\u201cI treated Bran and Rickon generously,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cThey brought their fate on themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAs do we all, little brother.\u201d\nHis patience was at an end. \u201cHow do you expect me to hold Winterfell if you bring me only twenty men?\u201d\n\u201cTen,\u201d Asha corrected. \u201cThe others return with me. You wouldn\u2019t want your own sweet sister to brave the dangers of the wood without an escort, would you? There are direwolves prowling the dark.\u201d She uncoiled from the great stone seat and rose to her feet. \u201cCome, let us go somewhere we can speak more privily.\u201d\nShe was right, he knew, though it galled him that she would make that decision. I should never have come to the hall, he realized belatedly. I should have summoned her to me.\nIt was too late for that now, however. Theon had no choice but to lead Asha to Ned Stark\u2019s solar. There, before the ashes of a dead fire, he blurted, \u201cDagmer\u2019s lost the fight at Torrhen\u2019s Square\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe old castellan broke his shield wall, yes,\u201d Asha said calmly. \u201cWhat did you expect? This Ser Rodrik knows the land intimately, as the Cleftjaw does not, and many of the northmen were mounted. The ironborn lack the discipline to stand a charge of armored horse. Dagmer lives, be grateful for that much. He\u2019s leading the survivors back toward the Stony Shore.\u201d\nShe knows more than I do, Theon realized. That only made him angrier. \u201cThe victory has given Leobald Tallhart the courage to come out from behind his walls and join Ser Rodrik. And I\u2019ve had reports that Lord Manderly has sent a dozen barges upriver packed with knights, warhorses, and siege engines. The Umbers are gathering beyond the Last River as well. I\u2019ll have an army at my gates before the moon turns, and you bring me only ten men?\u201d\n\u201cI need not have brought you any.\u201d\n\u201cI commanded you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFather commanded me to take Deepwood Motte,\u201d she snapped. \u201cHe said nothing of me having to rescue my little brother.\u201d\n\u201cBugger Deepwood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wooden pisspot on a hill. Winterfell is the heart of the land, but how am I to hold it without a garrison?\u201d\n\u201cYou might have thought of that before you took it. Oh, it was cleverly done, I\u2019ll grant you. If only you\u2019d had the good sense to raze the castle and carry the two little princelings back to Pyke as hostages, you might have won the war in a stroke.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? To see my prize reduced to ruins and ashes.\u201d\n\u201cYour prize will be the doom of you. Krakens rise from the sea, Theon, or did you forget that during your years among the wolves? Our strength is in our longships. My wooden pisspot sits close enough to the sea for supplies and fresh men to reach me whenever they are needful. But Winterfell is hundreds of leagues inland, ringed by woods, hills, and hostile holdfasts and castles. And every man in a thousand leagues is your enemy now, make no mistake. You made certain of that when you mounted those heads on your gatehouse.\u201d Asha shook her head. \u201cHow could you be such a bloody fool? Children\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey defied me!\u201d he shouted in her face. \u201cAnd it was blood for blood besides, two sons of Eddard Stark to pay for Rodrik and Maron.\u201d The words tumbled out heedlessly, but Theon knew at once that his father would approve. \u201cI\u2019ve laid my brothers\u2019 ghosts to rest.\u201d\n\u201cOur brothers,\u201d Asha reminded him, with a half smile that suggested she took his talk of vengeance well salted. \u201cDid you bring their ghosts from Pyke, brother? And here I thought they haunted only Father.\u201d\n\u201cWhen has a maid ever understood a man\u2019s need for revenge?\u201d Even if his father did not appreciate the gift of Winterfell, he must approve of Theon avenging his brothers!\nAsha snorted back a laugh. \u201cThis Ser Rodrik may well feel the same manly need, did you think of that? You are blood of my blood, Theon, whatever else you may be. For the sake of the mother who bore us both, return to Deepwood Motte with me. Put Winterfell to the torch and fall back while you still can.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Theon adjusted his crown. \u201cI took this castle and I mean to hold it.\u201d\nHis sister looked at him a long time. \u201cThen hold it you shall,\u201d she said, \u201cfor the rest of your life.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI say it tastes like folly, but what would a shy maid know of such things?\u201d At the door she gave him one last mocking smile. \u201cYou ought to know, that\u2019s the ugliest crown I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. Did you make it yourself?\u201d\nShe left him fuming, and lingered no longer than was needful to feed and water her horses. Half the men she\u2019d brought returned with her as threatened, riding out the same Hunter\u2019s Gate that Bran and Rickon had used for their escape.\nTheon watched them go from atop the wall. As his sister vanished into the mists of the wolfswood he found himself wondering why he had not listened and gone with her.\n\u201cGone, has she?\u201d Reek was at his elbow.\nTheon had not heard him approach, nor smelled him either. He could not think of anyone he wanted to see less. It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing, with what he knew. I should have had him killed after he did the others, he reflected, but the notion made him nervous. Unlikely as it seemed, Reek could read and write, and he was possessed of enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they\u2019d done.\n\u201cM\u2019lord prince, if you\u2019ll pardon me saying, it\u2019s not right for her to abandon you. And ten men, that won\u2019t be near enough.\u201d\n\u201cI am well aware of that,\u201d Theon said. So was Asha.\n\u201cWell, might be I could help you,\u201d said Reek. \u201cGive me a horse and bag o\u2019 coin, and I could find you some good fellows.\u201d\nTheon narrowed his eyes. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cA hundred, might be. Two hundred. Maybe more.\u201d He smiled, his pale eyes glinting. \u201cI was born up north here. I know many a man, and many a man knows Reek.\u201d\nTwo hundred men were not an army, but you didn\u2019t need thousands to hold a castle as strong as Winterfell. So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing, they might make all the difference. \u201cDo as you say and you\u2019ll not find me ungrateful. You can name your own reward.\u201d\n\u201cWell, m\u2019lord, I haven\u2019t had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay,\u201d Reek said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my eye on that Palla, and I hear she\u2019s already been had, so\u2026\u201d\nHe had gone too far with Reek to turn back now. \u201cTwo hundred men and she\u2019s yours. But a man less and you can go back to fucking pigs.\u201d\nReek was gone before the sun went down, carrying a bag of Stark silver and the last of Theon\u2019s hopes. Like as not, I\u2019ll never see the wretch again, he thought bitterly, but even so the chance had to be taken.\nThat night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to Winterfell. The hall rang with music and laughter, though the cold winds were rising outside. At first it was all wine and roast meat, and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time\u2026 until he noticed that the room was growing darker. The music did not seem so jolly then; he heard discords and strange silences, and notes that hung in the air bleeding. Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth, and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead.\nKing Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly, and Lord Eddard was headless beside him. Corpses lined the benches below, grey-brown flesh sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast, worms crawling in and out of the holes that were their eyes. He knew them, every one; Jory Cassel and Fat Tom, Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse, and all the others who had ridden south to King\u2019s Landing never to return. Mikken and Chayle sat together, one dripping blood and the other water. Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table. The miller\u2019s wife was there as well, and Farlen, even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved Bran\u2019s life.\nBut there were others with faces he had never known in life, faces he had seen only in stone. The slim, sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna. Her brother Brandon stood beside her, and their father Lord Rickard just behind. Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife. And then the tall doors opened with a crash, and a freezing gale blew down the hall, and Robb came walking out of the night. Grey Wind stalked beside, eyes burning, and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds.\nTheon woke with a scream, startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room. When his guards burst in with drawn swords, he ordered them to bring him the maester. By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy, a cup of wine had steadied Theon\u2019s hands, and he was feeling ashamed of his panic. \u201cA dream,\u201d he muttered, \u201cthat was all it was. It meant nothing.\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Luwin agreed solemnly. He left a sleeping draught, but Theon poured it down the privy shaft the moment he was gone. Luwin was a man as well as a maester, and the man had no love for him. He wants me to sleep, yes\u2026 to sleep and never wake. He\u2019d like that as much as Asha would.\nHe sent for Kyra, kicked shut the door, climbed on top of her, and fucked the wench with a fury he\u2019d never known was in him, By the time he finished, she was sobbing, her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks. Theon shoved her from the bed and threw her a blanket. \u201cGet out.\u201d\nYet even then, he could not sleep.\nCome dawn, he dressed and went outside, to walk along the outer walls. A brisk autumn wind was swirling through the battlements. It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes. He watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees. On his left he could see tower tops above the inner wall, their roofs gilded by the rising sun. The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green. Ned Stark\u2019s tree, he thought, and Stark\u2019s wood, Stark\u2019s castle, Stark\u2019s sword, Stark\u2019s gods. This is their place, not mine. I am a Greyjoy of Pyke, born to paint a kraken on my shield and sail the great salt sea. I should have gone with Asha.\nOn their iron spikes atop the gatehouse, the heads waited.\nTheon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on his cloak with small ghostly hands. The miller\u2019s boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon, alike in size and coloring, and once Reek had flayed the skin from their faces and dipped their heads in tar, it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh. People were such fools. If we\u2019d said they were rams\u2019 heads, they would have seen horns.",

      "content": "Sansa\nThey had been singing in the sept all morning, since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle. The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses, the clank of steel, and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music. In the sept they sing for the Mother\u2019s mercy but on the walls it\u2019s the Warrior they pray to, and all in silence. She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god. But if there is only one, whose prayers will be heard?\nSer Meryn Trant held the blood bay for Joffrey to mount. Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate, with matching golden lions on their heads. The pale sunlight flashed off the golds and reds every time Joff moved. Bright, shining, and empty, Sansa thought.\nThe Imp was mounted on a red stallion, armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in his father\u2019s clothes. But there was nothing childish about the battle-axe slung below his shield. Ser Mandon Moore rode at his side, white steel icy bright. When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way. \u201cLady Sansa,\u201d he called from the saddle, \u201csurely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cShe has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off. I mean to visit the sept as well, to pray.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t ask for whom.\u201d His mouth twisted oddly; if that was a smile, it was the queerest she had ever seen. \u201cThis day may change all. For you as well as for House Lannister. I ought to have sent you off with Tommen, now that I think on it. Still, you should be safe enough in Maegor\u2019s, so long as\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSansa!\u201d The boyish shout rang across the yard; Joffrey had seen her. \u201cSansa, here!\u201d\nHe calls me as if he were calling a dog, she thought.\n\u201cHis Grace has need of you,\u201d Tyrion Lannister observed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again after the battle, if the gods permit.\u201d\nSansa threaded her way through the file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned her closer. \u201cIt will be battle soon, everyone says so.\u201d\n\u201cMay the gods have mercy on us all.\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle\u2019s the one who will need mercy, but I won\u2019t give him any.\u201d Joffrey drew his sword. The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart, set between a lion\u2019s jaws. Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade. \u201cMy new blade, Hearteater.\u201d\nHe\u2019d owned a sword named Lion\u2019s Tooth once, Sansa remembered. Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river. I hope Stannis does the same with this one. \u201cIt is beautifully wrought, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cBless my steel with a kiss.\u201d He extended the blade down to her. \u201cGo on, kiss it.\u201d\nHe had never sounded more like a stupid little boy. Sansa touched her lips to the metal, thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey. The gesture seemed to please him, though. He sheathed the blade with a flourish. \u201cYou\u2019ll kiss it again when I return, and taste my uncle\u2019s blood.\u201d\nOnly if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you. Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle: Ser Meryn, Ser Mandon, and Ser Osmund Kettleblack. \u201cWill you lead your knights into battle?\u201d Sansa asked, hoping.\n\u201cI would, but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river. I\u2019ll command the Three Whores, though. I\u2019m going to see to the traitors myself.\u201d The prospect made Joff smile. His plump pink lips always made him look pouty. Sansa had liked that once, but now it made her sick.\n\u201cThey say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest,\u201d she said recklessly. \u201cThough he\u2019s older than Your Grace, to be sure. A man grown.\u201d\nThat made him frown. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with your brother after I\u2019m done with my traitor uncle. I\u2019ll gut him with Hearteater, you\u2019ll see.\u201d He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate. Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left, the gold cloaks following four abreast. The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear. The guards saw them off with off with shouts and cheers. When the last was gone, a sudden stillness settled over the yard, like the hush before a storm.\nThrough the quiet, the singing pulled at her. Sansa turned toward the sept. Two stableboys followed, and one of the guards whose watch was ended. Others fell in behind them.\nSansa had never seen the sept so crowded, nor so brightly lit; great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows, and candles burned on every side, their little flames twinkling like stars. The Mother\u2019s altar and the Warrior\u2019s swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well, and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger\u2019s half-human face\u2026 for what was Stannis Baratheon, if not the Stranger come to judge them? Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn, lighting a candle at each altar, and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon, dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight\u2019s son. The old woman\u2019s hand was bony and hard with callus, the boy\u2019s small and soft, but it was good to have someone to hold on to. The air was hot and heavy, smelling of incense and sweat, crystal-kissed and candle-bright; it made her dizzy to breathe it.\nShe knew the hymn; her mother had taught it to her once, a long time ago in Winterfell. She joined her voice to theirs.\nGentle Mother, font of mercy,save our sons from war, we pray,stay the swords and stay the arrows,let them know a better day.Gentle Mother, strength of women,help our daughters through this fray,soothe the wrath and tame the fury,teach us all a kinder way.\nAcross the city, thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\u2019s Hill, and they would be singing too, their voices swelling out over the city, across the river, and up into the sky. Surely the gods must hear us, she thought.\nSansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those she did not know as best she could. She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives, with serving girls and soldiers, cooks and falconers, knights and knaves, squires and spit boys and nursing mothers. She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without, sang with all the city. She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. She sang for her mother and her father, for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully, for her friend Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound. He is no true knight but he saved me all the same, she told the Mother. Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him.\nBut when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king, Sansa got to her feet. The aisles were jammed with people. She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey\u2019s sword and shield, the Warrior to give him courage, the Father to defend him in his need. Let his sword break and his shield shatter, Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors, let his courage fail him and every man desert him.\nA few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements, but otherwise the castle seemed empty. Sansa stopped and listened. Away off, she could hear the sounds of battle. The singing almost drowned them out, but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear: the deep moan of warhorns, the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones, the splashes and splinterings, the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts\u2026 and beneath it all, the cries of dying men.\nIt was another sort of song, a terrible song. Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears, and hurried toward Maegor\u2019s Holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe. At the foot of the drawbridge, she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters. Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers. She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge, but Lollys clung to her maid, sobbing, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cThe battle is begun,\u201d Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nThere was no way Sansa could avoid them. She greeted them courteously. \u201cMay I be of help?\u201d\nLady Tanda flushed with shame. \u201cNo, my lady, but we thank you kindly. You must forgive my daughter, she has not been well.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Lollys clutched at her maid, a slender, pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat, onto those iron spikes. \u201cPlease, please, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nSansa spoke to her gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be thrice protected inside, and there\u2019s to be food and drink and song as well.\u201d\nLollys gaped at her, mouth open. She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d her sister Falyse said sharply, \u201cand that is the end of it. Shae, help me.\u201d They each took an elbow, and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge. Sansa followed with their mother. \u201cShe\u2019s been sick,\u201d Lady Tanda said. If a babe can be termed a sickness, Sansa thought. It was common gossip that Lollys was with child.\nThe two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister, but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords. Another sat at the foot of the stair\u2014a real guard would have been standing, not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees\u2014but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside.\nThe Queen\u2019s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle\u2019s Great Hall, only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand, but it could still seat a hundred, and it made up in grace what it lacked in space. Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce, so the torches burned twice as bright; the walls were paneled in richly carved wood, and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors. From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle. A line of arched windows ran along the south wall, but they had been closed off with heavy draperies. Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light, and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike. It makes no matter, Sansa thought. The war is with us.\nAlmost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables, along with a handful of old men and young boys. The women were wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters. Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis. Many would not return. The air was heavy with the knowledge. As Joffrey\u2019s betrothed, Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen\u2019s right hand. She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall. He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail, and held his sword before him: her father\u2019s greatsword, Ice, near as tall as he was. Its point rested on the floor, and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip. Sansa\u2019s breath caught in her throat. Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare. He turned his gaunt, pox-ravaged face toward her.\n\u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d she asked Osfryd Kettleblack. He captained the queen\u2019s new red cloak guard.\nOsfryd grinned. \u201cHer Grace expects she\u2019ll have need of him before the night\u2019s done.\u201d\nSer Ilyn was the King\u2019s Justice. There was only one service he might be needed for. Whose head does she want?\n\u201cAll rise for Her Grace, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm,\u201d the royal steward cried.\nCersei\u2019s gown was snowy linen, white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard. Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin. Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls. Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds. The white made her look strangely innocent, almost maidenly, but there were points of color on her cheeks.\n\u201cBe seated,\u201d the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais, \u201cand be welcome.\u201d Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair; a page performed the same service for Sansa. \u201cYou look pale, Sansa,\u201d Cersei observed. \u201cIs your red flower still blooming?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHow apt. The men will bleed out there, and you in here.\u201d The queen signaled for the first course to be served.\n\u201cWhy is Ser Ilyn here?\u201d Sansa blurted out.\nThe queen glanced at the mute headsman. \u201cTo deal with treason, and to defend us if need be. He was a knight before he was a headsman.\u201d She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall, where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred. \u201cWhen the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him.\u201d\nI would be gladder if it were the Hound, Sansa thought. Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her. \u201cWon\u2019t your guards protect us?\u201d\n\u201cAnd who will protect us from my guards?\u201d The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look. \u201cLoyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores. If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off. They\u2019ll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women, and stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides. Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn\u2019t, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers, and there\u2019s such a dearth of good sacking songs.\u201d\n\u201cTrue knights would never harm women and children.\u201d The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them.\n\u201cTrue knights.\u201d The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019re right. So why don\u2019t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you, sweetling. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be very long now.\u201d",

      "content": "Davos\nBlackwater Bay was rough and choppy, whitecaps everywhere. Black Betha rode the flood tide, her sail cracking and snapping at each shift of wind. Wraith and Lady Marya sailed beside her, no more than twenty yards between their hulls. His sons could keep a line. Davos took pride in that.\nAcross the sea warhorns boomed, deep throaty moans like the calls of monstrous serpents, repeated ship to ship. \u201cBring down the sail,\u201d Davos commanded. \u201cLower mast. Oarsmen to your oars.\u201d His son Matthos relayed the commands. The deck of Black Betha churned as crewmen ran to their tasks, pushing through the soldiers who always seemed to be in the way no matter where they stood. Ser Imry had decreed that they would enter the river on oars alone, so as not to expose their sails to the scorpions and spitfires on the walls of King\u2019s Landing.\nDavos could make out Fury well to the southeast, her sails shimmering golden as they came down, the crowned stag of Baratheon blazoned on the canvas. From her decks Stannis Baratheon had commanded the assault on Dragonstone sixteen years before, but this time he had chosen to ride with his army, trusting Fury and the command of his fleet to his wife\u2019s brother Ser Imry, who\u2019d come over to his cause at Storm\u2019s End with Lord Alester and all the other Florents.\nDavos knew Fury as well as he knew his own ships. Above her three hundred oars was a deck given over wholly to scorpions, and topside she mounted catapults fore and aft, large enough to fling barrels of burning pitch. A most formidable ship, and very swift as well, although Ser Imry had packed her bow to stern with armored knights and men-at-arms, at some cost to her speed.\nThe warhorns sounded again, commands drifting back from the Fury. Davos felt a tingle in his missing fingertips. \u201cOut oars,\u201d he shouted. \u201cForm line.\u201d A hundred blades dipped down into the water as the oarmaster\u2019s drum began to boom. The sound was like the beating of a great slow heart, and the oars moved at every stroke, a hundred men pulling as one.\nWooden wings had sprouted from the Wraith and Lady Marya as well. The three galleys kept pace, their blades churning the water. \u201cSlow cruise,\u201d Davos called. Lord Velaryon\u2019s silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark had moved into her position to port of Wraith, and Bold Laughter was coming up fast, but Harridan was only now getting her oars into the water and Seahorse was still struggling to bring down her mast. Davos looked astern. Yes, there, far to the south, that could only be Swordfish, lagging as ever. She dipped two hundred oars and mounted the largest ram in the fleet, though Davos had grave doubts about her captain.\nHe could hear soldiers shouting encouragement to each other across the water. They\u2019d been little more than ballast since Storm\u2019s End, and were eager to get at the foe, confident of victory. In that, they were of one mind with their admiral, Lord High Captain Ser Imry Florent.\nThree days past, he had summoned all his captains to a war council aboard the Fury while the fleet lay anchored at the mouth of the Wendwater, in order to acquaint them with his dispositions. Davos and his sons had been assigned a place in the second line of battle, well out on the dangerous starboard wing. \u201cA place of honor,\u201d Allard had declared, well satisfied with the chance to prove his valor. \u201cA place of peril,\u201d his father had pointed out. His sons had given him pitying looks, even young Maric. The Onion Knight has become an old woman, he could hear them thinking, still a smuggler at heart.\nWell, the last was true enough, he would make no apologies for it. Seaworth had a lordly ring to it, but down deep he was still Davos of Flea Bottom, coming home to his city on its three high hills. He knew as much of ships and sails and shores as any man in the Seven Kingdoms, and had fought his share of desperate fights sword to sword on a wet deck. But to this sort of battle he came a maiden, nervous and afraid. Smugglers do not sound warhorns and raise banners. When they smell danger, they raise sail and run before the wind.\nHad he been admiral, he might have done it all differently. For a start, he would have sent a few of his swiftest ships to probe upriver and see what awaited them, instead of smashing in headlong. When he had suggested as much to Ser Imry, the Lord High Captain had thanked him courteously, but his eyes were not as polite. Who is this lowborn craven? those eyes asked. Is he the one who bought his knighthood with an onion?\nWith four times as many ships as the boy king, Ser Imry saw no need for caution or deceptive tactics. He had organized the fleet into ten lines of battle, each of twenty ships. The first two lines would sweep up the river to engage and destroy Joffrey\u2019s little fleet, or \u201cthe boy\u2019s toys\u201d as Ser Imry dubbed them, to the mirth of his lordly captains. Those that followed would land companies of archers and spearmen beneath the city walls, and only then join the fight on the river. The smaller, slower ships to the rear would ferry over the main part of Stannis\u2019s host from the south bank, protected by Salladhor Saan and his Lyseni, who would stand out in the bay in case the Lannisters had other ships hidden up along the coast, poised to sweep down on their rear.\nTo be fair, there was reason for Ser Imry\u2019s haste. The winds had not used them kindly on the voyage up from Storm\u2019s End. They had lost two cogs to the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay on the very day they set sail, a poor way to begin. One of the Myrish galleys had foundered in the Straits of Tarth, and a storm had overtaken them as they were entering the Gullet, scattering the fleet across half the narrow sea. All but twelve ships had finally regrouped behind the sheltering spine of Massey\u2019s Hook, in the calmer waters of Blackwater Bay, but not before they had lost considerable time.\nStannis would have reached the Rush days ago. The kingsroad ran from Storm\u2019s End straight to King\u2019s Landing, a much shorter route than by sea, and his host was largely mounted; near twenty thousand knights, light horse, and freeriders, Renly\u2019s unwilling legacy to his brother. They would have made good time, but armored destriers and twelve-foot lances would avail them little against the deep waters of the Blackwater Rush and the high stone walls of the city. Stannis would be camped with his lords on the south bank of the river, doubtless seething with impatience and wondering what Ser Imry had done with his fleet.\nOff Merling Rock two days before, they had sighted a half-dozen fishing skiffs. The fisherfolk had fled before them, but one by one they had been overtaken and boarded. \u201cA small spoon of victory is just the thing to settle the stomach before battle,\u201d Ser Imry had declared happily. \u201cIt makes the men hungry for a larger helping.\u201d But Davos had been more interested in what the captives had to say about the defenses at King\u2019s Landing. The dwarf had been busy building some sort of boom to close off the mouth of the river, though the fishermen differed as to whether the work had been completed or not. He found himself wishing it had. If the river was closed to them, Ser Imry would have no choice but to pause and take stock.\nThe sea was full of sound: shouts and calls, warhorns and drums and the trill of pipes, the slap of wood on water as thousands of oars rose and fell. \u201cKeep line,\u201d Davos shouted. A gust of wind tugged at his old green cloak. A jerkin of boiled leather and a pothelm at his feet were his only armor. At sea, heavy steel was as like to cost a man his life as to save it, he believed. Ser Imry and the other highborn captains did not share his view; they glittered as they paced their decks.\nHarridan and Seahorse had slipped into their places now, and Lord Celtigar\u2019s Red Claw beyond them. To starboard of Allard\u2019s Lady Marya were the three galleys that Stannis had seized from the unfortunate Lord Sunglass, Piety, Prayer, and Devotion, their decks crawling with archers. Even Swordfish was closing, lumbering and rolling through a thickening sea under both oars and sail. A ship of that many oars ought to be much faster, Davos reflected with disapproval. It\u2019s that ram she carries, it\u2019s too big, she has no balance.\nThe wind was gusting from the south, but under oars it made no matter. They would be sweeping in on the flood tide, but the Lannisters would have the river current to their favor, and the Blackwater Rush flowed strong and swift where it met the sea. The first shock would inevitably favor the foe. We are fools to meet them on the Blackwater, Davos thought. In any encounter on the open sea, their battle lines would envelop the enemy fleet on both flanks, driving them inward to destruction. On the river, though, the numbers and weight of Ser Imry\u2019s ships would count for less. They could not dress more than twenty ships abreast, lest they risk tangling their oars and colliding with each other.\nBeyond the line of warships, Davos could see the Red Keep up on Aegon\u2019s High Hill, dark against a lemon sky, with the mouth of the Rush opening out below. Across the river the south shore was black with men and horses, stirring like angry ants as they caught sight of the approaching ships. Stannis would have kept them busy building rafts and fletching arrows, yet even so the waiting would have been a hard thing to bear. Trumpets sounded from among them, tiny and brazen, soon swallowed by the roar of a thousand shouts. Davos closed his stubby hand around the pouch that held his fingerbones, and mouthed a silent prayer for luck.\nFury herself would center the first line of battle, flanked by the Lord Steffon and the Stag of the Sea, each of two hundred oars. On the port and starboard wings were the hundreds: Lady Harra, Brightfish, Laughing Lord, Sea Demon, Horned Honor, Ragged Jenna, Trident Three, Swift Sword, Princess Rhaenys, Dog\u2019s Nose, Sceptre, Faithful, Red Raven, Queen Alysanne, Cat, Courageous, and Dragonsbane. From every stern streamed the fiery heart of the Lord of Light, red and yellow and orange. Behind Davos and his sons came another line of hundreds commanded by knights and lordly captains, and then the smaller, slower Myrish contingent, none dipping more than eighty oars. Farther back would come the sailed ships, carracks and lumbering great cogs, and last of all Salladhor Saan in his proud Valyrian, a towering three-hundred, paced by the rest of his galleys with their distinctive striped hulls. The flamboyant Lyseni princeling had not been pleased to be assigned the rear guard, but it was clear that Ser Imry trusted him no more than Stannis did. Too many complaints, and too much talk of the gold he was owed. Davos was sorry nonetheless. Salladhor Saan was a resourceful old pirate, and his crews were born seamen, fearless in a fight. They were wasted in the rear.\nAhooooooooooooooooooooooooo. The call rolled across whitecaps and churning oars from the forecastle of the Fury: Ser Imry was sounding the attack. Ahoooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooooooooo.\nSwordfish had joined the line at last, though she still had her sail raised. \u201cFast cruise,\u201d Davos barked. The drum began to beat more quickly, and the stroke picked up, the blades of the oars cutting water, splash-swoosh, splash-swoosh, splash-swoosh. On deck, soldiers banged sword against shield, while archers quietly strung their bows and pulled the first arrow from the quivers at their belts. The galleys of the first line of battle obscured his vision, so Davos paced the deck searching for a better view. He saw no sign of any boom; the mouth of the river was open, as if to swallow them all. Except\u2026\nIn his smuggling days, Davos had often jested that he knew the waterfront at King\u2019s Landing a deal better than the back of his hand, since he had not spent a good part of his life sneaking in and out of the back of his hand. The squat towers of raw new stone that stood opposite one another at the mouth of the Blackwater might mean nothing to Ser Imry Florent, but to him it was as if two extra fingers had sprouted from his knuckles.\nShading his eyes against the westering sun, he peered at those towers more closely. They were too small to hold much of a garrison. The one on the north bank was built against the bluff with the Red Keep frowning above; its counterpart on the south shore had its footing in the water. They dug a cut through the bank, he knew at once. That would make the tower very difficult to assault; attackers would need to wade through the water or bridge the little channel. Stannis had posted bowmen below, to fire up at the defenders whenever one was rash enough to lift his head above the ramparts, but otherwise had not troubled.\nSomething flashed down low where the dark water swirled around the base of the tower. It was sunlight on steel, and it told Davos Seaworth all he needed to know. A chain boom\u2026 and yet they have not closed the river against us. Why?\nHe could make a guess at that as well, but there was no time to consider the question. A shout went up from the ships ahead, and the warhorns blew again: the enemy was before them.\nBetween the flashing oars of Sceptre and Faithful, Davos saw a thin line of galleys drawn across the river, the sun glinting off the gold paint that marked their hulls. He knew those ships as well as he knew his own. When he had been a smuggler, he\u2019d always felt safer knowing whether the sail on the horizon marked a fast ship or a slow one, and whether her captain was a young man hungry for glory or an old one serving out his days.\nAhooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, the warhorns called. \u201cBattle speed,\u201d Davos shouted. On port and starboard he heard Dale and Allard giving the same command. Drums began to beat furiously, oars rose and fell, and Black Betha surged forward. When he glanced toward Wraith, Dale gave him a salute. Swordfish was lagging once more, wallowing in the wake of the smaller ships to either side; elsewise the line was straight as a shield wall.\nThe river that had seemed so narrow from a distance now stretched wide as a sea, but the city had grown gigantic as well. Glowering down from Aegon\u2019s High Hill, the Red Keep commanded the approaches. Its iron-crowned battlements, massive towers, and thick red walls gave it the aspect of a ferocious beast hunched above river and streets. The bluffs on which it crouched were steep and rocky, spotted with lichen and gnarled thorny trees. The fleet would have to pass below the castle to reach the harbor and city beyond.\nThe first line was in the river now, but the enemy galleys were backing water. They mean to draw us in. They want us jammed close, constricted, no way to sweep around their flanks\u2026 and with that boom behind us. He paced his deck, craning his neck for a better look at Joffrey\u2019s fleet. The boy\u2019s toys included the ponderous Godsgrace, he saw, the old slow Prince Aemon, the Lady of Silk and her sister Lady\u2019s Shame, Wildwind, Kingslander, White Hart, Lance, Seaflower. But where was the Lionstar? Where was the beautiful Lady Lyanna that King Robert had named in honor of the maid he\u2019d loved and lost? And where was King Robert\u2019s Hammer? She was the largest war galley in the royal fleet, four hundred oars, the only warship the boy king owned capable of overmatching Fury. By rights she should have formed the heart of any defense.\nDavos tasted a trap, yet he saw no sign of any foes sweeping in behind them, only the great fleet of Stannis Baratheon in their ordered ranks, stretching back to the watery horizon. Will they raise the chain and cut us in two? He could not see what good that would serve. The ships left out in the bay could still land men north of the city; a slower crossing, but safer.\nA flight of flickering orange birds took wing from the castle, twenty or thirty of them; pots of burning pitch, arcing out over the river trailing threads of flame. The waters ate most, but a few found the decks of galleys in the first line of battle, spreading flame when they shattered. Men-at-arms were scrambling on Queen Alysanne\u2019s deck, and he could see smoke rising from three different spots on Dragonsbane, nearest the bank. By then a second flight was on its way, and arrows were falling as well, hissing down from the archers\u2019 nests that studded the towers above. A soldier tumbled over Cat\u2019s gunwale, crashed off the oars, and sank. The first man to die today, Davos thought, but he will not be the last.\nAtop the Red Keep\u2019s battlements streamed the boy king\u2019s banners: the crowned stag of Baratheon on its gold field, the lion of Lannister on crimson. More pots of pitch came flying. Davos heard men shriek as fire spread across Courageous. Her oarsmen were safe below, protected from missiles by the half deck that sheltered them, but the men-at-arms crowded topside were not so fortunate. The starboard wing was taking all the damage, as he had feared. It will be our turn soon, he reminded himself, uneasy. Black Betha was well in range of the firepots, being the sixth ship out from the north bank. To starboard, she had only Allard\u2019s Lady Marya, the ungainly Swordfish\u2014so far behind now that she was nearer the third line than the second\u2014and Piety, Prayer, and Devotion, who would need all the godly intervention they could get, placed as vulnerably as they were.\nAs the second line swept past the twin towers, Davos took a closer look. He could see three links of a huge chain snaking out from a hole no bigger than a man\u2019s head and disappearing under the water. The towers had a single door, set a good twenty feet off the ground. Bowmen on the roof of the northern tower were firing down at Prayer and Devotion. The archers on Devotion fired back, and Davos heard a man scream as the arrows found him.\n\u201cCaptain ser.\u201d His son Matthos was at his elbow. \u201cYour helm.\u201d Davos took it with both hands and slid it over his head. The pothelm was visorless; he hated having his vision impeded.\nBy then the pitch pots were raining down around them. He saw one shatter on the deck of Lady Marya, but Allard\u2019s crew quickly beat it out. To port, warhorns sounded from the Pride of Driftmark. The oars flung up sprays of water with every stroke. The yard-long shaft of a scorpion came down not two feet from Matthos and sank into the wood of the deck, thrumming. Ahead, the first line was within bowshot of the enemy; flights of arrows flew between the ships, hissing like striking snakes.\nSouth of the Blackwater, Davos saw men dragging crude rafts toward the water while ranks and columns formed up beneath a thousand streaming banners. The fiery heart was everywhere, though the tiny black stag imprisoned in the flames was too small to make out. We should be flying the crowned stag, he thought. The stag was King Robert\u2019s sigil, the city would rejoice to see it. This stranger\u2019s standard serves only to set men against us.\nHe could not behold the fiery heart without thinking of the shadow Melisandre had birthed in the gloom beneath Storm\u2019s End. At least we fight this battle in the light, with the weapons of honest men, he told himself. The red woman and her dark children would have no part of it. Stannis had shipped her back to Dragonstone with his bastard nephew Edric Storm. His captains and bannermen had insisted that a battlefield was no place for a woman. Only the queen\u2019s men had dissented, and then not loudly. All the same, the king had been on the point of refusing them until Lord Bryce Caron said, \u201cYour Grace, if the sorceress is with us, afterward men will say it was her victory, not yours. They will say you owe your crown to her spells.\u201d That had turned the tide. Davos himself had held his tongue during the arguments, but if truth be told, he had not been sad to see the back of her. He wanted no part of Melisandre or her god.\nTo starboard, Devotion drove toward shore, sliding out a plank. Archers scrambled into the shallows, holding their bows high over their heads to keep the strings dry. They splashed ashore on the narrow strand beneath the bluffs. Rocks came bouncing down from the castle to crash among them, and arrows and spears as well, but the angle was steep and the missiles seemed to do little damage.\nPrayer landed two dozen yards upstream and Piety was slanting toward the bank when the defenders came pounding down the riverside, the hooves of their warhorses sending up gouts of water from the shallows. The knights fell among the archers like wolves among chickens, driving them back toward the ships and into the river before most could notch an arrow. Men-at-arms rushed to defend them with spear and axe, and in three heartbeats the scene had turned to blood-soaked chaos. Davos recognized the dog\u2019s-head helm of the Hound. A white cloak streamed from his shoulders as he rode his horse up the plank onto the deck of Prayer, hacking down anyone who blundered within reach.\nBeyond the castle, King\u2019s Landing rose on its hills behind the encircling walls. The riverfront was a blackened desolation; the Lannisters had burned everything and pulled back within the Mud Gate. The charred spars of sunken hulks sat in the shallows, forbidding access to the long stone quays. We shall have no landing there. He could see the tops of three huge trebuchets behind the Mud Gate. High on Visenya\u2019s Hill, sunlight blazed off the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor.\nDavos never saw the battle joined, but he heard it; a great rending crash as two galleys came together. He could not say which two. Another impact echoed over the water an instant later, and then a third. Beneath the screech of splintering wood, he heard the deep thrum-thump of the Fury\u2019s fore catapult. Stag of the Sea split one of Joffrey\u2019s galleys clean in two, but Dog\u2019s Nose was afire and Queen Alysanne was locked between Lady of Silk and Lady\u2019s Shame, her crew fighting the boarders rail-to-rail.\nDirectly ahead, Davos saw the enemy\u2019s Kingslander drive between Faithful and Sceptre. The former slid her starboard oars out of the way before impact, but Sceptre\u2019s portside oars snapped like so much kindling as Kingslander raked along her side. \u201cLoose,\u201d Davos commanded, and his bowmen sent a withering rain of shafts across the water. He saw Kingslander\u2019s captain fall, and tried to recall the man\u2019s name.\nAshore, the arms of the great trebuchets rose one, two, three, and a hundred stones climbed high into the yellow sky. Each one was as large as a man\u2019s head; when they fell they sent up great gouts of water, smashed through oak planking, and turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle. All across the river the first line was engaged. Grappling hooks were flung out, iron rams crashed through wooden hulls, boarders swarmed, flights of arrows whispered through each other in the drifting smoke, and men died\u2026 but so far, none of his.\nBlack Betha swept upriver, the sound of her oarmaster\u2019s drum thundering in her captain\u2019s head as he looked for a likely victim for her ram. The beleaguered Queen Alysanne was trapped between two Lannister warships, the three made fast by hooks and lines.\n\u201cRamming speed!\u201d Davos shouted.\nThe drumbeats blurred into a long fevered hammering, and Black Betha flew, the water turning white as milk as it parted for her prow. Allard had seen the same chance; Lady Marya ran beside them. The first line had been transformed into a confusion of separate struggles. The three tangled ships loomed ahead, turning, their decks a red chaos as men hacked at each other with sword and axe. A little more, Davos Seaworth beseeched the Warrior, bring her around a little more, show me her broadside.\nThe Warrior must have been listening. Black Betha and Lady Marya slammed into the side of Lady\u2019s Shame within an instant of each other, ramming her fore and aft with such force that men were thrown off the deck of Lady of Silk three boats away. Davos almost bit his tongue off when his teeth jarred together. He spat out blood. Next time close your mouth, you fool. Forty years at sea, and yet this was the first time he\u2019d rammed another ship. His archers were loosing arrows at will.\n\u201cBack water,\u201d he commanded. When Black Betha reversed her oars, the river rushed into the splintered hole she left, and Lady\u2019s Shame fell to pieces before his eyes, spilling dozens of men into the river. Some of the living swam; some of the dead floated; the ones in heavy mail and plate sank to the bottom, the quick and the dead alike. The pleas of drowning men echoed in his ears.\nA flash of green caught his eye, ahead and off to port, and a nest of writhing emerald serpents rose burning and hissing from the stern of Queen Alysanne. An instant later Davos heard the dread cry of \u201cWildfire!\u201d\nHe grimaced. Burning pitch was one thing, wildfire quite another. Evil stuff, and well-nigh unquenchable. Smother it under a cloak and the cloak took fire; slap at a fleck of it with your palm and your hand was aflame. \u201cPiss on wildfire and your cock burns off,\u201d old seamen liked to say. Still, Ser Imry had warned them to expect a taste of the alchemists\u2019 vile substance. Fortunately, there were few true pyromancers left. They will soon run out, Ser Imry had assured them.\nDavos reeled off commands; one bank of oars pushed off while the other backed water, and the galley came about. Lady Marya had won clear too, and a good thing; the fire was spreading over Queen Alysanne and her foes faster than he would have believed possible. Men wreathed in green flame leapt into the water, shrieking like nothing human. On the walls of King\u2019s Landing, spitfires were belching death, and the great trebuchets behind the Mud Gate were throwing boulders. One the size of an ox crashed down between Black Betha and Wraith, rocking both ships and soaking every man on deck. Another, not much smaller, found Bold Laughter. The Velaryon galley exploded like a child\u2019s toy dropped from a tower, spraying splinters as long as a man\u2019s arm.\nThrough black smoke and swirling green fire, Davos glimpsed a swarm of small boats bearing downriver: a confusion of ferries and wherries, barges, skiffs, rowboats, and hulks that looked too rotten to float. It stank of desperation; such driftwood could not turn the tide of a fight, only get in the way. The lines of battle were hopelessly ensnarled, he saw. Off to port, Lord Steffon, Ragged Jenna, and Swift Sword had broken through and were sweeping upriver. The starboard wing was heavily engaged, however, and the center had shattered under the stones of those trebuchets, some captains turning downstream, others veering to port, anything to escape that crushing rain. Fury had swung her aft catapult to fire back at the city, but she lacked the range; the barrels of pitch were shattering under the walls. Sceptre had lost most of her oars, and Faithful had been rammed and was starting to list. He took Black Betha between them, and struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei\u2019s ornate carved-and-gilded pleasure barge, laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now. The collision spilled a dozen of them into the river, where Betha\u2019s archers picked them off as they tried to stay afloat.\nMatthos\u2019s shout alerted him to the danger from port; one of the Lannister galleys was coming about to ram. \u201cHard to starboard,\u201d Davos shouted. His men used their oars to push free of the barge, while others turned the galley so her prow faced the onrushing White Hart. For a moment he feared he\u2019d been too slow, that he was about to be sunk, but the current helped swing Black Betha, and when the impact came it was only a glancing blow, the two hulls scraping against each other, both ships snapping oars. A jagged piece of wood flew past his head, sharp as any spear. Davos flinched. \u201cBoard her!\u201d he shouted. Grappling lines were flung. He drew his sword and led them over the rail himself.\nThe crew of the White Hart met them at the rail, but Black Betha\u2019s men-at-arms swept over them in a screaming steel tide. Davos fought through the press, looking for the other captain, but the man was dead before he reached him. As he stood over the body, someone caught him from behind with an axe, but his helm turned the blow, and his skull was left ringing when it might have been split. Dazed, it was all he could do to roll. His attacker charged screaming. Davos grasped his sword in both hands and drove it up point first into the man\u2019s belly.\nOne of his crewmen pulled him back to his feet. \u201cCaptain ser, the Hart is ours.\u201d It was true, Davos saw. Most of the enemy were dead, dying, or yielded. He took off his helm, wiped blood from his face, and made his way back to his own ship, trodding carefully on boards slimy with men\u2019s guts. Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail.\nFor those few instants, Black Betha and White Hart were the calm eye in the midst of the storm. Queen Alysanne and Lady of Silk, still locked together, were a ranging green inferno, drifting downriver and dragging pieces of Lady\u2019s Shame. One of the Myrish galleys had slammed into them and was now afire as well. Cat was taking on men from the fast-sinking Courageous. The captain of Dragonsbane had driven her between two quays, ripping out her bottom; her crew poured ashore with the archers and men-at-arms to join the assault on the walls. Red Raven, rammed, was slowly listing. Stag of the Sea was fighting fires and boarders both, but the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey\u2019s Loyal Man. Fury, her proud bow smashed in by a boulder, was engaged with Godsgrace. He saw Lord Velaryon\u2019s Pride of Driftmark crash between two Lannister river runners, overturning one and lighting the other up with fire arrows. On the south bank, knights were leading their mounts aboard the cogs, and some of the smaller galleys were already making their way across, laden with men-at-arms. They had to thread cautiously between sinking ships and patches of drifting wildfire. The whole of King Stannis\u2019s fleet was in the river now, save for Salladhor Saan\u2019s Lyseni. Soon enough they would control the Blackwater. Ser Imry will have his victory, Davos thought, and Stannis will bring his host across, but gods be good, the cost of this\u2026\n\u201cCaptain ser!\u201d Matthos touched his shoulder.\nIt was Swordfish, her two banks of oars lifting and falling. She had never brought down her sails, and some burning pitch had caught in her rigging. The flames spread as Davos watched, creeping out over ropes and sails until she trailed a head of yellow flame. Her ungainly iron ram, fashioned after the likeness of the fish from which she took her name, parted the surface of the river before her. Directly ahead, drifting toward her and swinging around to present a tempting plump target, was one of the Lannister hulks, floating low in the water. Slow green blood was leaking out between her boards.\nWhen he saw that, Davos Seaworth\u2019s heart stopped beating.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, NOOOOOOOO!\u201d Above the roar and crash of battle, no one heard him but Matthos. Certainly the captain of the Swordfish did not, intent as he was on finally spearing something with his ungainly fat sword. The Swordfish went to battle speed. Davos lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones.\nWith a grinding, splintering, tearing crash, Swordfish split the rotted hulk asunder. She burst like an overripe fruit, but no fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream. From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars, poison from the entrails of a dying beast, glistening, shining, spreading across the surface of the river\u2026\n\u201cBack water,\u201d he roared. \u201cAway. Get us off her, back water, back water!\u201d The grappling lines were cut, and Davos felt the deck move under his feet as Black Betha pushed free of White Hart. Her oars slid down into the water.\nThen he heard a short sharp woof, as if someone had blown in his ear. Half a heartbeat later came the roar. The deck vanished beneath him, and black water smashed him across the face, filling his nose and mouth. He was choking, drowning. Unsure which way was up, Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly he broke the surface. He spat out water, sucked in air, grabbed hold of the nearest chunk of debris, and held on.\nSwordfish and the hulk were gone, blackened bodies were floating downstream beside him, and choking men clinging to bits of smoking wood. Fifty feet high, a swirling demon of green flame danced upon the river. It had a dozen hands, in each a whip, and whatever they touched burst into fire. He saw Black Betha burning, and White Hart and Loyal Man to either side. Piety, Cat, Courageous, Sceptre, Red Raven, Harridan, Faithful, Fury, they had all gone up, Kingslander and Godsgrace as well, the demon was eating his own. Lord Velaryon\u2019s shining Pride of Driftmark was trying to turn, but the demon ran a lazy green finger across her silvery oars and they flared up like so many tapers. For an instant she seemed to be stroking the river with two banks of long bright torches.\nThe current had him in its teeth by then, spinning him around and around. He kicked to avoid a floating patch of wildfire. My sons, Davos thought, but there was no way to look for them amidst the roaring chaos. Another hulk heavy with wildfire went up behind him. The Blackwater itself seemed to boil in its bed, and burning spars and burning men and pieces of broken ships filled the air.\nI\u2019m being swept out into the bay. It wouldn\u2019t be as bad there; he ought to be able to make shore, he was a strong swimmer. Salladhor Saan\u2019s galleys would be out in the bay as well, Ser Imry had commanded them to stand off\u2026\nAnd then the current turned him about again, and Davos saw what awaited him downstream.\nThe chain. Gods save us, they\u2019ve raised the chain.\nWhere the river broadened out into Blackwater Bay, the boom stretched taut, a bare two or three feet above the water. Already a dozen galleys had crashed into it, and the current was pushing others against them. Almost all were aflame, and the rest soon would be. Davos could make out the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan\u2019s ships beyond, but he knew he would never reach them. A wall of red-hot steel, blazing wood, and swirling green flame stretched before him. The mouth of the Blackwater Rush had turned into the mouth of hell.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nMotionless as a gargoyle, Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon. Beyond the Mud Gate and the desolation that had once been the fishmarket and wharves, the river itself seemed to have taken fire. Half of Stannis\u2019s fleet was ablaze, along with most of Joffrey\u2019s. The kiss of wildfire turned proud ships into funeral pyres and men into living torches. The air was full of smoke and arrows and screams.\nDownstream, commoners and highborn captains alike could see the hot green death swirling toward their rafts and carracks and ferries, borne on the current of the Blackwater. The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as they fought to come about, but it was no good. The centipedes had no place to run.\nA dozen great fires raged under the city walls, where casks of burning pitch had exploded, but the wildfire reduced them to no more than candles in a burning house, their orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust. The low clouds caught the color of the burning river and roofed the sky in shades of shifting green, eerily beautiful. A terrible beauty. Like dragonfire. Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror had felt like this as he flew above his Field of Fire.\nThe furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face, yet he could not turn away. He was dimly aware of the gold cloaks cheering from the hoardings. He had no voice to join them. It was a half victory. It will not be enough.\nHe saw another of the hulks he\u2019d stuffed full of King Aerys\u2019s fickle fruits engulfed by the hungry flames. A fountain of burning jade rose from the river the blast so bright he had to shield his eyes. Plumes of fire thirty and forty feet high danced upon the waters, crackling and hissing. For a few moments they washed out the screams. There were hundreds in the water, drowning or burning or doing a little of both.\nDo you hear them shrieking, Stannis? Do you see them burning? This is your work as much as mine. Somewhere in that seething mass of men south of the Blackwater, Stannis was watching too, Tyrion knew. He\u2019d never had his brother Robert\u2019s thirst for battle. He would command from the rear, from the reserve, much as Lord Tywin Lannister was wont to do. Like as not, he was sitting a warhorse right now, clad in bright armor, his crown upon his head. A crown of red gold, Varys says, its points fashioned in the shapes of flames.\n\u201cMy ships.\u201d Joffrey\u2019s voice cracked as he shouted up from the wallwalk, where he huddled with his guards behind the ramparts. The golden circlet of kingship adorned his battle helm. \u201cMy Kingslander\u2019s burning, Queen Cersei, Loyal Man. Look, that\u2019s Seaflower, there.\u201d He pointed with his new sword, out to where the green flames were licking at Seaflower\u2019s golden hull and creeping up her oars. Her captain had turned her upriver, but not quickly enough to evade the wildfire.\nShe was doomed, Tyrion knew. There was no other way. If we had not come forth to meet them, Stannis would have sensed the trap. An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of its own. Once loosed, it was beyond the control of mere men. \u201cIt could not be helped,\u201d he told his nephew. \u201cOur fleet was doomed in any case.\u201d\nEven from atop the merlon\u2014he had been too short to see over the ramparts, so he\u2019d had them boost him up\u2014the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle, but he had seen it a thousand times in his mind\u2019s eye. Bronn would have whipped the oxen into motion the moment Stannis\u2019s flagship passed under the Red Keep; the chain was ponderous heavy, and the great winches turned but slowly, creaking and rumbling. The whole of the usurper\u2019s fleet would have passed by the time the first glimmer of metal could be seen beneath the water. The links would emerge dripping wet, some glistening with mud, link by link by link, until the whole great chain stretched taut. King Stannis had rowed his fleet up the Blackwater, but he would not row out again.\nEven so, some were getting away. A river\u2019s current was a tricky thing, and the wildfire was not spreading as evenly as he had hoped. The main channel was all aflame, but a good many of the Myrmen had made for the south bank and looked to escape unscathed, and at least eight ships had landed under the city walls. Landed or wrecked, but it comes to the same thing, they\u2019ve put men ashore. Worse, a good part of the south wing of the enemy\u2019s first two battle lines had been well upstream of the inferno when the hulks went up. Stannis would be left with thirty or forty galleys, at a guess; more than enough to bring his whole host across, once they had regained their courage.\nThat might take a bit of time; even the bravest would be dismayed after watching a thousand or so of his fellows consumed by wildfire. Hallyne said that sometimes the substance burned so hot that flesh melted like tallow. Yet even so\u2026\nTyrion had no illusions where his own men were concerned. If the battle looks to be going sour they\u2019ll break, and they\u2019ll break bad, Jacelyn Bywater had warned him, so the only way to win was to make certain the battle stayed sweet, start to finish.\nHe could see dark shapes moving through the charred ruins of the riverfront wharfs. Time for another sortie, he thought. Men were never so vulnerable as when they first staggered ashore. He must not give the foe time to form up on the north bank.\nHe scrambled down off the merlon. \u201cTell Lord Jacelyn we\u2019ve got enemy on the riverfront,\u201d he said to one of the runners Bywater had assigned him. To another he said, \u201cBring my compliments to Ser Arneld and ask him to swing the Whores thirty degrees west.\u201d The angle would allow them to throw farther, if not as far out into the water.\n\u201cMother promised I could have the Whores,\u201d Joffrey said. Tyrion was annoyed to see that the king had lifted the visor of his helm again. Doubtless the boy was cooking inside all that heavy steel\u2026 but the last thing he needed was some stray arrow punching through his nephew\u2019s eye.\nHe clanged the visor shut. \u201cKeep that closed, Your Grace; your sweet person is precious to us all.\u201d And you don\u2019t want to spoil that pretty face, either. \u201cThe Whores are yours.\u201d It was as good a time as any; flinging more firepots down onto burning ships seemed pointless. Joff had the Antler Men trussed up naked in the square below, antlers nailed to their heads. When they\u2019d been brought before the Iron Throne for justice, he had promised to send them to Stannis. A man was not as heavy as a boulder or a cask of burning pitch, and could be thrown a deal farther. Some of the gold cloaks had been wagering on whether the traitors would fly all the way across the Blackwater. \u201cBe quick about it, Your Grace,\u201d he told Joffrey. \u201cWe\u2019ll want the trebuchets throwing stones again soon enough. Even wildfire does not burn forever.\u201d\nJoffrey hurried off happy, escorted by Ser Meryn, but Tyrion caught Ser Osmund by the wrist before he could follow. \u201cWhatever happens, keep him safe and keep him there, is that understood?\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d Ser Osmund smiled amiably.\nTyrion had warned Trant and Kettleblack what would happen to them should any harm come to the king. And Joffrey had a dozen veteran gold cloaks waiting at the foot of the steps. I\u2019m protecting your wretched bastard as well as I can, Cersei, he thought bitterly. See you do the same for Alayaya.\nNo sooner was Joff off than a runner came panting up the steps. \u201cMy lord, hurry!\u201d He threw himself to one knee. \u201cThey\u2019ve landed men on the tourney grounds, hundreds! They\u2019re bringing a ram up to the King\u2019s Gate.\u201d\nTyrion cursed and made for the steps with a rolling waddle. Podrick Payne waited below with their horses. They galloped off down River Row, Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming hard behind him. The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow, but there was no traffic to get in their way; Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear, so the defenders could move quickly from one gate to the next. Even so, by the time they reached the King\u2019s Gate, he could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told him the battering ram had been brought into play. The groaning of the great hinges sounded like the moans of a dying giant. The gatehouse square was littered with the wounded, but he saw lines of horses as well, not all of them hurt, and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column. \u201cForm up,\u201d he shouted as he leapt to the ground. The gate moved under the impact of another blow. \u201cWho commands here? You\u2019re going out.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d A shadow detached itself from the shadow of the wall, to become a tall man in dark grey armor. Sandor Clegane wrenched off his helm with both hands and let it fall to the ground. The steel was scorched and dented, the left ear of the snarling hound sheared off. A gash above one eye had sent a wash of blood down across the Hound\u2019s old burn scars, masking half his face.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tyrion faced him.\nClegane\u2019s breath came ragged. \u201cBugger that. And you.\u201d\nA sellsword stepped up beside him. \u201cWe been out. Three times. Half our men are killed or hurt. Wildfire bursting all around us, horses screaming like men and men like horses\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you think we hired you to fight in a tourney? Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and a bowl of raspberries? No? Then get on your fucking horse. You too, dog.\u201d\nThe blood on Clegane\u2019s face glistened red, but his eyes showed white. He drew his longsword.\nHe is afraid, Tyrion realized, shocked. The Hound is frightened. He tried to explain their need. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a ram to the gate, you can hear them, we need to disperse them\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOpen the gates. When they rush inside, surround them and kill them.\u201d The Hound thrust the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel, swaying. \u201cI\u2019ve lost half my men. Horse as well. I\u2019m not taking more into that fire.\u201d\nSer Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion\u2019s side, immaculate in his enameled white plate. \u201cThe King\u2019s Hand commands you.\u201d\n\u201cBugger the King\u2019s Hand.\u201d Where the Hound\u2019s face was not sticky with blood, it was pale as milk. \u201cSomeone bring me a drink.\u201d A gold cloak officer handed him a cup. Clegane took a swallow, spit it out, flung the cup away. \u201cWater? Fuck your water. Bring me wine.\u201d\nHe is dead on his feet. Tyrion could see it now. The wound, the fire\u2026 he\u2019s done, I need to find someone else, but who? Ser Mandon? He looked at the men and knew it would not do. Clegane\u2019s fear had shaken them. Without a leader, they would refuse as well, and Ser Mandon\u2026 a dangerous man, Jaime said, yes, but not a man other men would follow.\nIn the distance Tyrion heard another great crash. Above the walls, the darkening sky was awash with sheets of green and orange light. How long could the gate hold?\nThis is madness, he thought, but sooner madness than defeat. Defeat is death and shame. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll lead the sortie.\u201d\nIf he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor, he was wrong. Clegane only laughed. \u201cYou?\u201d\nTyrion could see the disbelief on their faces. \u201cMe. Ser Mandon, you\u2019ll bear the king\u2019s banner. Pod, my helm.\u201d The boy ran to obey. The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-streaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes. Ser Mandon helped Tyrion mount up again. \u201cForm up!\u201d he shouted.\nHis big red stallion wore crinet and chamfron. Crimson silk draped his hindquarters, over a coat of mail. The high saddle was gilded. Podrik Payne handed up helm and shield, heavy oak emblazoned with a golden hand on red, surrounded by small golden lions. He walked his horse in a circle, looking at the little force of men. Only a handful had responded to his command, no more than twenty. They sat their horses with eyes as white as the Hound\u2019s. He looked contemptuously at the others, the knights and sellswords who had ridden with Clegane. \u201cThey say I\u2019m half a man,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does that make the lot of you?\u201d\nThat shamed them well enough. A knight mounted, helmetless, and rode to join the others. A pair of sellswords followed. Then more. The King\u2019s Gate shuddered again. In a few moments the size of Tyrion\u2019s command had doubled. He had them trapped. If I fight, they must do the same, or they are less than dwarfs.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hear me shout out Joffrey\u2019s name,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou won\u2019t hear me yell for Casterly Rock either. This is your city Stannis means to sack, and that\u2019s your gate he\u2019s bringing down. So come with me and kill the son of a bitch!\u201d Tyrion unsheathed his axe, wheeled the stallion around, and trotted toward the sally port. He thought they were following, but never dared to look.",

      "content": "Sansa\nThe torches shimmered brightly against the hammered metal of the wall sconces, filling the Queen\u2019s Ballroom with silvery light. Yet there was still darkness in that hall. Sansa could see it in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne, who stood by the back door still as stone, taking neither food nor wine. She could hear it in Lord Gyles\u2019s racking cough, and the whispered voice of Osney Kettleblack when he slipped in to bring Cersei the tidings.\nSansa was finishing her broth when he came the first time, entering through the back. She glimpsed him talking to his brother Osfryd. Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the high seat, smelling of horse, four long thin scratches on his cheek crusted with scabs, his hair falling down past his collar and into his eyes. For all his whispering, Sansa could not help but hear. \u201cThe fleets are locked in battle. Some archers got ashore, but the Hound\u2019s cut them to pieces, Y\u2019Grace. Your brother\u2019s raising his chain, I heard the signal. Some drunkards down to Flea Bottom are smashing doors and climbing through windows. Lord Bywater\u2019s sent the gold cloaks to deal with them. Baelor\u2019s Sept is jammed full, everyone praying.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my son?\u201d\n\u201cThe king went to Baelor\u2019s to get the High Septon\u2019s blessing. Now he\u2019s walking the walls with the Hand, telling the men to be brave, lifting their spirits as it were.\u201d\nCersei beckoned to her page for another cup of wine, a golden vintage from the Arbor, fruity and rich. The queen was drinking heavily, but the wine only seemed to make her more beautiful; her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes had a bright, feverish heat to them as she looked down over the hall. Eyes of wildfire, Sansa thought.\nMusicians played. Jugglers juggled. Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making mock of everyone, while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on his broomstick horse. The guests laughed, but it was a joyless laughter, the sort of laughter that can turn into sobbing in half a heartbeat. Their bodies are here, but their thoughts are on the city walls, and their hearts as well.\nAfter the broth came a salad of apples, nuts, and raisins. At any other time, it might have made a tasty dish, but tonight all the food was flavored with fear. Sansa was not the only one in the hall without an appetite. Lord Gyles was coughing more than he was eating, Lollys Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering, and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel\u2019s knights began to weep uncontrollably. The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put her to bed with a cup of dreamwine. \u201cTears,\u201d she said scornfully to Sansa as the woman was led from the hall. \u201cThe woman\u2019s weapon, my lady mother used to call them. The man\u2019s weapon is a sword. And that tells us all you need to know, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cMen must be very brave, though,\u201d said Sansa. \u201cTo ride out and face swords and axes, everyone trying to kill you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed.\u201d She lifted her cup and took a long swallow. Her salad was untouched. \u201cI would sooner face any number of swords than sit helpless like this, pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened hens.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked them here, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cCertain things are expected of a queen. They will be expected of you should you ever wed Joffrey. Best learn.\u201d The queen studied the wives, daughters, and mothers who filled the benches. \u201cOf themselves the hens are nothing, but their cocks are important for one reason or another, and some may survive this battle. So it behooves me to give their women my protection. If my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail, they will return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was, how my courage inspired them and lifted their spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a moment.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if the castle should fall?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Cersei did not wait for a denial. \u201cIf I\u2019m not betrayed by my own guards, I may be able to hold here for a time. Then I can go to the walls and offer to yield to Lord Stannis in person. That will spare us the worst. But if Maegor\u2019s Holdfast should fall before Stannis can come up, why then, most of my guests are in for a bit of rape, I\u2019d say. And you should never rule out mutilation, torture, and murder at times like these.\u201d\nSansa was horrified. \u201cThese are women, unarmed, and gently born.\u201d\n\u201cTheir birth protects them,\u201d Cersei admitted, \u201cthough not as much as you\u2019d think. Each one\u2019s worth a good ransom, but after the madness of battle, soldiers often seem to want flesh more than coin. Even so, a golden shield is better than none. Out in the streets, the women won\u2019t be treated near as tenderly. Nor will our servants. Pretty things like that serving wench of Lady Tanda\u2019s could be in for a lively night, but don\u2019t imagine the old and the infirm and the ugly will be spared. Enough drink will make blind washerwomen and reeking pig girls seem as comely as you, sweetling.\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cTry not to sound so like a mouse, Sansa. You\u2019re a woman now, remember? And betrothed to my firstborn.\u201d The queen sipped at her wine. \u201cWere it anyone else outside the gates, I might hope to beguile him. But this is Stannis Baratheon. I\u2019d have a better chance of seducing his horse.\u201d She noticed the look on Sansa\u2019s face, and laughed. \u201cHave I shocked you, my lady?\u201d She leaned close. \u201cYou little fool. Tears are not a woman\u2019s only weapon. You\u2019ve got another one between your legs, and you\u2019d best learn to use it. You\u2019ll find men use their swords freely enough. Both kinds of swords.\u201d\nSansa was spared the need to reply when two Kettleblacks reentered the hall. Ser Osmund and his brothers had become great favorites about the castle; they were always ready with a smile and a jest, and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as they did with knights and squires. With the serving wenches they got on best of all, it was gossiped. Of late Ser Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane\u2019s place by Joffrey\u2019s side, and Sansa had heard the women at the washing well saying he was as strong as the Hound, only younger and faster. If that was so, she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was named to the Kingsguard.\nOsney was all smiles as he knelt beside the queen. \u201cThe hulks have gone up, Y\u2019Grace. The whole Blackwater\u2019s awash with wildfire. A hundred ships burning, maybe more.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my son?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s at the Mud Gate with the Hand and the Kingsguard, Y\u2019Grace. He spoke to the archers on the hoardings before, and gave them a few tips on handling a crossbow, he did. All agree, he\u2019s a right brave boy.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d best remain a right live boy.\u201d Cersei turned to his brother Osfryd, who was taller, sterner, and wore a drooping black mustache. \u201cYes?\u201d\nOsfryd had donned a steel halfhelm over his long black hair, and the look on his face was grim, \u201cY\u2019Grace,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthe boys caught a groom and two maidservants trying to sneak out a postern with three of the king\u2019s horses.\u201d\n\u201cThe night\u2019s first traitors,\u201d the queen said, \u201cbut not the last, I fear. Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning.\u201d As they left, she turned to Sansa. \u201cAnother lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son. Be gentle on a night like this and you\u2019ll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain. The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.\u201d\n\u201cI will remember, Your Grace,\u201d said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people\u2019s loyalty than fear. If I am ever a queen, I\u2019ll make them love me.\nCrabclaw pies followed the salad. Then came mutton roasted with leeks and carrots, served in trenchers of hollowed bread. Lollys ate too fast, got sick, and retched all over herself and her sister. Lord Gyles coughed, drank, coughed, drank, and passed out. The queen gazed down in disgust to where he sprawled with his face in his trencher and his hand in a puddle of wine. \u201cThe gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have been mad to demand his release.\u201d\nOsfryd Kettleblack returned, crimson cloak swirling. \u201cThere\u2019s folks gathering in the square, Y\u2019Grace, asking to take refuge in the castle. Not a mob, rich merchants and the like.\u201d\n\u201cCommand them to return to their homes,\u201d the queen said. \u201cIf they won\u2019t go, have our crossbowmen kill a few. No sorties; I won\u2019t have the gates opened for any reason.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d He bowed and moved off.\nThe queen\u2019s face was hard and angry. \u201cWould that I could take a sword to their necks myself.\u201d Her voice was starting to slur. \u201cWhen we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other\u2019s clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me. \u2018What do I get?\u2019 I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime\u2019s lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.\u201d\n\u201cBut you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cWhen it comes to swords, a queen is only a woman after all.\u201d\nCersei\u2019s wine cup was empty. The page moved to fill it again, but she turned it over and shook her head. \u201cNo more. I must keep a clear head.\u201d\nThe last course was goat cheese served with baked apples. The scent of cinnamon filled the hall as Osney Kettleblack slipped in to kneel once more between them. \u201cY\u2019Grace,\u201d he murmured. \u201cStannis has landed men on the tourney grounds, and there\u2019s more coming across. The Mud Gate\u2019s under attack, and they\u2019ve brought a ram to the King\u2019s Gate. The Imp\u2019s gone out to drive them off.\u201d\n\u201cThat will fill them with fear,\u201d the queen said dryly. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t taken Joff, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Y\u2019Grace, the king\u2019s with my brother at the Whores, flinging Antler Men into the river.\u201d\n\u201cWith the Mud Gate under assault? Folly. Tell Ser Osmund I want him out of there at once, it\u2019s too dangerous. Fetch him back to the castle.\u201d\n\u201cThe Imp said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I said that ought concern you.\u201d Cersei\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYour brother will do as he\u2019s told, or I\u2019ll see to it that he leads the next sortie himself, and you\u2019ll go with him.\u201d\nAfter the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept. Cersei graciously granted their request. Lady Tanda and her daughters were among those who fled. For those who remained, a singer was brought forth to fill the hall with the sweet music of the high harp. He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and his love for his brother\u2019s queen, of Nymeria\u2019s ten thousand ships. They were beautiful songs, but terribly sad. Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt her own eyes growing moist.\n\u201cVery good, dear.\u201d The queen leaned close. \u201cYou want to practice those tears. You\u2019ll need them for King Stannis.\u201d\nSansa shifted nervously. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d\n\u201cOh, spare me your hollow courtesies. Matters must have reached a desperate strait out there if they need a dwarf to lead them, so you might as well take off your mask. I know all about your little treasons in the godswood.\u201d\n\u201cThe godswood?\u201d Don\u2019t look at Ser Dontos, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, Sansa told herself. She doesn\u2019t know, no one knows, Dontos promised me, my Florian would never fail me. \u201cI\u2019ve done no treasons. I only visit the godswood to pray.\u201d\n\u201cFor Stannis. Or your brother, it\u2019s all the same. Why else seek your father\u2019s gods? You\u2019re praying for our defeat. What would you call that, if not treason?\u201d\n\u201cI pray for Joffrey,\u201d she insisted nervously.\n\u201cWhy, because he treats you so sweetly?\u201d The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa\u2019s cup. \u201cDrink,\u201d she commanded coldly. \u201cPerhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change.\u201d\nSansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip. The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very strong.\n\u201cYou can do better than that,\u201d Cersei said. \u201cDrain the cup, Sansa. Your queen commands you.\u201d It almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.\n\u201cMore?\u201d Cersei asked.\n\u201cNo. Please.\u201d\nThe queen looked displeased. \u201cWhen you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you. Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he\u2019s really here?\u201d\nShe did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man\u2019s head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown. \u201cTell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,\u201d said Cersei.\nSer Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle. His pox-scarred face had no expression.\n\u201cHe\u2019s here for us, he says,\u201d the queen said. \u201cStannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me. I do not mean for him to have us alive.\u201d\n\u201cUs?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome. The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.\u201d She reached out and touched Sansa\u2019s hair, brushing it lightly away from her neck.",

      "content": "Tyrion\nThe slot in his helm limited Tyrion\u2019s vision to what was before him, but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.\n\u201cWedge,\u201d Tyrion commanded as his men streamed out of the sally port. They formed up in spearhead, with him at the point. Ser Mandon Moore took the place to his right, flames shimmering against the white enamel of his armor, his dead eyes shining passionlessly through his helm. He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white, with the pure white shield of the Kingsguard strapped to his arm. On the left, Tyrion was surprised to see Podrick Payne, a sword in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re too young,\u201d he said at once. \u201cGo back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m your squire, my lord.\u201d\nTyrion could spare no time for argument. \u201cWith me, then. Stay close.\u201d He kicked his horse into motion.\nThey rode knee to knee, following the line of the looming walls. Joffrey\u2019s standard streamed crimson and gold from Ser Mandon\u2019s staff, stag and lion dancing hoof to paw. They went from a walk to a trot, wheeling wide around the base of the tower. Arrows darted from the city walls while stones spun and tumbled overhead, crashing down blindly onto earth and water, steel and flesh. Ahead loomed the King\u2019s Gate and a surging mob of soldiers wrestling with a huge ram, a shaft of black oak with an iron head. Archers off the ships surrounded them, loosing their shafts at whatever defenders showed themselves on the gatehouse walls. \u201cLances,\u201d Tyrion commanded. He sped to a canter.\nThe ground was sodden and slippery, equal parts mud and blood. His stallion stumbled over a corpse, his hooves sliding and churning the earth, and for an instant Tyrion feared his charge would end with him tumbling from the saddle before he even reached the foe, but somehow he and his horse both managed to keep their balance. Beneath the gate men were turning, hurriedly trying to brace for the shock. Tyrion lifted his axe and shouted, \u201cKing\u2019s Landing!\u201d Other voices took up the cry, and now the arrowhead flew, a long scream of steel and silk, pounding hooves and sharp blades kissed by fire.\nSer Mandon dropped the point of his lance at the last possible instant, and drove Joffrey\u2019s banner through the chest of a man in a studded jerkin, lifting him full off his feet before the shaft snapped. Ahead of Tyrion was a knight whose surcoat showed a fox peering through a ring of flowers. Florent was his first thought, but helmless ran a close second. He smashed the man in the face with all the weight of axe and arm and charging horse, taking off half his head. The shock of impact numbed his shoulder. Shagga would laugh at me, he thought, riding on.\nA spear thudded against his shield. Pod galloped beside him, slashing down at every foe they passed. Dimly, he heard cheers from the men on the walls. The battering ram crashed down into the mud, forgotten in an instant as its handlers fled or turned to fight. Tyrion rode down an archer, opened a spearman from shoulder to armpit, glanced a blow off a swordfish-crested helm. At the ram his big red reared but the black stallion leapt the obstacle smoothly and Ser Mandon flashed past him, death in snow-white silk. His sword sheared off limbs, cracked heads, broke shields asunder\u2014though few enough of the enemy had made it across the river with shields intact.\nTyrion urged his mount over the ram. Their foes were fleeing. He moved his head right to left and back again, but saw no sign of Podrick Payne. An arrow clattered against his cheek, missing his eye slit by an inch. His jolt of fear almost unhorsed him. If I\u2019m to sit here like a stump, I had as well paint a target on my breastplate.\nHe spurred his horse back into motion, trotting over and around a scatter of corpses. Downriver, the Blackwater was jammed with the hulks of burning galleys. Patches of wildfire still floated atop the water, sending fiery green plumes swirling twenty feet into the air. They had dispersed the men on the battering ram, but he could see fighting all along the riverfront. Ser Balon Swann\u2019s men, most like, or Lancel\u2019s, trying to throw the enemy back into the water as they swarmed ashore off the burning ships. \u201cWe\u2019ll ride for the Mud Gate,\u201d he commanded.\nSer Mandon shouted, \u201cThe Mud Gate!\u201d And they were off again. \u201cKing\u2019s Landing!\u201d his men cried raggedly, and \u201cHalfman! Halfman!\u201d He wondered who had taught them that. Through the steel and padding of his helm, he heard anguished screams, the hungry crackle of flame, the shuddering of warhorns, and the brazen blast of trumpets. Fire was everywhere. Gods be good, no wonder the Hound was frightened. It\u2019s the flames he fears\u2026\nA splintering crash rang across the Blackwater as a stone the size of a horse landed square amidships on one of the galleys. Ours or theirs? Through the roiling smoke, he could not tell. His wedge was gone; every man was his own battle now. I should have turned back, he thought, riding on.\nThe axe was heavy in his fist. A handful still followed him, the rest dead or fled. He had to wrestle his stallion to keep his head to the east. The big destrier liked fire no more than Sandor Clegane had, but the horse was easier to cow.\nMen were crawling from the river, men burned and bleeding, coughing up water, staggering, most dying. He led his troop among them, delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand. The war shrank to the size of his eye slit. Knights twice his size fled from him, or stood and died. They seemed little things, and fearful. \u201cLannister!\u201d he shouted, slaying. His arm was red to the elbow, glistening in the light off the river. When his horse reared again, he shook his axe at the stars and heard them call out \u201cHalfman! Halfman!\u201d Tyrion felt drunk.\nThe battle fever. He had never thought to experience it himself, though Jaime had told him of it often enough. How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop, how the past and the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant, how fear fled, and thought fled, and even your body. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel your wounds then, or the ache in your back from the weight of the armor, or the sweat running down into your eyes. You stop feeling, you stop thinking, you stop being you, there is only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next, and you know they are afraid and tired but you\u2019re not, you\u2019re alive, and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly, you can dance through them laughing.\u201d Battle fever. I am half a man and drunk with slaughter, let them kill me if they can!\nThey tried. Another spearman ran at him. Tyrion lopped off the head of his spear, then his hand, then his arm, trotting around him in a circle. An archer, bowless, thrust at him with an arrow, holding it as if it were a knife. The destrier kicked at the man\u2019s thigh to send him sprawling, and Tyrion barked laughter. He rode past a banner planted in the mud, one of Stannis\u2019s fiery hearts, and chopped the staff in two with a swing of his axe. A knight rose up from nowhere to hack at his shield with a two-handed greatsword, again and again, until someone thrust a dagger under his arm. One of Tyrion\u2019s men, perhaps. He never saw.\n\u201cI yield, ser,\u201d a different knight called out, farther down the river. \u201cYield. Ser knight, I yield to you. My pledge, here, here.\u201d The man lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a lobstered gauntlet in token of submission. Tyrion had to lean down to take it from him. As he did, a pot of wildfire burst overhead, spraying green flame. In the sudden stab of light he saw that the puddle was not black but red. The gauntlet still had the knight\u2019s hand in it. He flung it back. \u201cYield,\u201d the man sobbed hopelessly, helplessly. Tyrion reeled away.\nA man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of his horse and thrust at Tyrion\u2019s face with a dagger. He knocked the blade aside and buried the axe in the nape of the man\u2019s neck. As he was wresting it free, a blaze of white appeared at the edge of his vision. Tyrion turned, thinking to find Ser Mandon Moore beside him again, but this was a different white knight. Ser Balon Swann wore the same armor, but his horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans of his House. He\u2019s more a spotted knight than a white one, Tyrion thought inanely. Every bit of Ser Balon was spattered with gore and smudged by smoke. He raised his mace to point downriver. Bits of brain and bone clung to its head. \u201cMy lord, look.\u201d\nTyrion swung his horse about to peer down the Blackwater. The current still flowed black and strong beneath, but the surface was a roil of blood and flame. The sky was red and orange and garish green. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said. Then he saw.\nSteel-clad men-at-arms were clambering off a broken galley that had smashed into a pier. So many, where are they coming from? Squinting into the smoke and glare, Tyrion followed them back out into the river. Twenty galleys were jammed together out there, maybe more, it was hard to count. Their oars were crossed, their hulls locked together with grappling lines, they were impaled on each other\u2019s rams, tangled in webs of fallen rigging. One great hulk floated hull up between two smaller ships. Wrecks, but packed so closely that it was possible to leap from one deck to the other and so cross the Blackwater.\nHundreds of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s boldest were doing just that. Tyrion saw one great fool of a knight trying to ride across, urging a terrified horse over gunwales and oars, across tilting decks slick with blood and crackling with green fire. We made them a bloody bridge, he thought in dismay. Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment, but that did not seem to stop them. \u201cThose are brave men,\u201d he told Ser Balon in admiration. \u201cLet\u2019s go kill them.\u201d\nHe led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront, pounding down a long stone quay with his own men and Ser Balon\u2019s behind him. Ser Mandon fell in with them, his shield a ragged ruin. Smoke and cinders swirled through the air, and the foe broke before their charge, throwing themselves back into the water, knocking over other men as they fought to climb up. The foot of the bridge was a half-sunken enemy galley with Dragonsbane painted on her prow, her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion had placed between the quays. A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar drove the point of his weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann\u2019s horse before he could dismount, spilling the knight from the saddle. Tyrion hacked at the man\u2019s head as he flashed by, and by then it was too late to rein up. His stallion leapt from the end of the quay and over a splintered gunwale, landing with a splash and a scream in ankle-deep water. Tyrion\u2019s axe went spinning, followed by Tyrion himself, and the deck rose up to give him a wet smack.\nMadness followed. His horse had broken a leg and was screaming horribly. Somehow he managed to draw his dagger, and slit the poor creature\u2019s throat. The blood gushed out in a scarlet fountain, drenching his arms and chest. He found his feet again and lurched to the rail, and then he was fighting, staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water. Men came at him. Some he killed, some he wounded, and some went away, but always there were more. He lost his knife and gained a broken spear, he could not have said how. He clutched it and stabbed, shrieking curses. Men ran from him and he ran after them, clambering up over the rail to the next ship and then the next. His two white shadows were always with him; Balon Swann and Mandon Moore, beautiful in their pale plate. Surrounded by a circle of Velaryon spearmen, they fought back to back; they made battle as graceful as a dance.\nHis own killing was a clumsy thing. He stabbed one man in the kidney when his back was turned, and grabbed another by the leg and upended him into the river. Arrows hissed past his head and clattered off his armor; one lodged between shoulder and breastplate, but he never felt it. A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck, body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower. His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion\u2019s helm. Stones began to plummet down, crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp, until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot, knocking him sideways.\nSuddenly the river was pouring into his helm. He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck deep. A groaning filled the air, like the death cries of some enormous beast, The ship, he had time to think, the ship\u2019s about to tear loose. The broken galleys were ripping apart, the bridge breaking apart. No sooner had he come to that realization than he heard a sudden crack, loud as thunder, the deck lurched beneath him, and he slid back down into the water.\nThe list was so steep he had to climb back up, hauling himself along a snapped line inch by bloody inch. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the hulk they\u2019d been tangled with drifting downstream with the current, spinning slowly as men leapt over her side. Some wore Stannis\u2019s flaming heart, some Joffrey\u2019s stag-and-lion, some other badges, but it seemed to make no matter. Fires were burning upstream and down. On one side of him was a raging battle, a great confusion of bright banners waving above a sea of struggling men, shield walls forming and breaking, mounted knights cutting through the press, dust and mud and blood and smoke. On the other side, the Red Keep loomed high on its hill, spitting fire. They were on the wrong sides, though. For a moment Tyrion thought he was going mad, that Stannis and the castle had traded places. How could Stannis cross to the north bank? Belatedly he realized that the deck was turning, and somehow he had gotten spun about, so castle and battle had changed sides. Battle, what battle, if Stannis hasn\u2019t crossed who is he fighting? Tyrion was too tired to make sense of it. His shoulder ached horribly, and when he reached up to rub it he saw the arrow, and remembered. I have to get off this ship. Downstream was nothing but a wall of fire, and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into it.\nSomeone was calling his name faintly through the din of battle. Tyrion tried to shout back. \u201cHere! Here, I\u2019m here, help me!\u201d His voice sounded so thin he could scarcely hear himself. He pulled himself up the slanting deck, and grabbed for the rail. The hull slammed into the next galley over and rebounded so violently he was almost knocked into the water. Where had all his strength gone? It was all he could do to hang on.\n\u201cMY LORD! TAKE MY HAND! MY LORD TYRION!\u201d\nThere on the deck of the next ship, across a widening gulf of black water, stood Ser Mandon Moore, a hand extended. Yellow and green fire shone against the white of his armor, and his lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood, but Tyrion reached for it all the same, wishing his arms were longer. It was only at the very last, as their fingers brushed across the gap, that something niggled at him\u2026 Ser Mandon was holding out his left hand, why\u2026\nWas that why he reeled backward, or did he see the sword after all? He would never know. The point slashed just beneath his eyes, and he felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze of pain. His head spun around as if he\u2019d been slapped. The shock of the cold water was a second slap more jolting than the first. He flailed for something to grab on to, knowing that once he went down he was not like to come back up. Somehow his hand found the splintered end of a broken oar. Clutching it tight as a desperate lover, he shinnied up foot by foot. His eyes were full of water, his mouth was full of blood, and his head throbbed horribly. Gods give me strength to reach the deck\u2026 There was nothing else, only the oar, the water, the deck.\nFinally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted, flat on his back. Balls of green and orange flame crackled overhead, leaving streaks between the stars. He had a moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view. The knight was a white steel shadow, his eyes shining darkly behind his helm. Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll. Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt.\nAnd suddenly he lurched to the left, staggering into the rail. Wood split, and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash. An instant later, the hulls came slamming together again, so hard the deck seemed to jump. Then someone was kneeling over him. \u201cJaime?\u201d he croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth. Who else would save him, if not his brother?\n\u201cBe still, my lord, you\u2019re hurt bad.\u201d A boy\u2019s voice, that makes no sense, thought Tyrion. It sounded almost like Pod.",

      "content": "Sansa\nWhen Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said, \u201cTell my brother, ser.\u201d Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to her.\n\u201cYour brother\u2019s likely dead.\u201d Ser Lancel\u2019s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under his arm. When he had arrived in the hall, the sight of him had made some of the guests scream. \u201cHe was on the bridge of boats when it broke apart, we think. Ser Mandon\u2019s likely gone as well, and no one can find the Hound. Gods be damned, Cersei, why did you have them fetch Joffrey back to the castle? The gold cloaks are throwing down their spears and running, hundreds of them. When they saw the king leaving, they lost all heart. The whole Blackwater\u2019s awash with wrecks and fire and corpses, but we could have held if\u2014\u201d\nOsney Kettleblack pushed past him. \u201cThere\u2019s fighting on both sides of the river now, Y\u2019Grace. It may be that some of Stannis\u2019s lords are fighting each other, no one\u2019s sure, it\u2019s all confused over there. The Hound\u2019s gone, no one knows where, and Ser Balon\u2019s fallen back inside the city. The riverside\u2019s theirs. They\u2019re ramming at the King\u2019s Gate again, and Ser Lancel\u2019s right, your men are deserting the walls and killing their own officers. There\u2019s mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out, and Flea Bottom\u2019s one great drunken riot.\u201d\nGods be good, Sansa thought, it is happening, Joffrey\u2019s lost his head and so have I. She looked for Ser Ilyn, but the King\u2019s Justice was not to be seen. I can feel him, though. He\u2019s close, I\u2019ll not escape him, he\u2019ll have my head.\nStrangely calm, the queen turned to his brother Osfryd. \u201cRaise the drawbridge and bar the doors. No one enters or leaves Maegor\u2019s without my leave.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about them women who went to pray?\u201d\n\u201cThey chose to leave my protection. Let them pray; perhaps the gods will defend them. Where\u2019s my son?\u201d\n\u201cThe castle gatehouse. He wanted to command the crossbowmen. There\u2019s a mob howling outside, half of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate.\u201d\n\u201cBring him inside Maegor\u2019s now.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lancel was so angry he forgot to keep his voice down. Heads turned toward them as he shouted, \u201cWe\u2019ll have the Mud Gate all over again. Let him stay where he is, he\u2019s the king\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d Cersei Lannister rose to her feet. \u201cYou claim to be a Lannister as well, cousin, prove it. Osfryd, why are you standing there? Now means today.\u201d\nOsfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall, his brother with him. Many of the guests were rushing out as well. Some of the women were weeping, some praying. Others simply remained at the tables and called for more wine. \u201cCersei,\u201d Ser Lancel pleaded, \u201cif we lose the castle, Joffrey will be killed in any case, you know that. Let him stay, I\u2019ll keep him by me, I swear\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d Cersei slammed her open palm into his wound. Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen swept from the room. She spared Sansa not so much as a glance. She\u2019s forgotten me. Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won\u2019t even think about it.\n\u201cOh, gods,\u201d an old woman wailed. \u201cWe\u2019re lost, the battle\u2019s lost, she\u2019s running.\u201d Several children were crying. They can smell the fear. Sansa found herself alone on the dais. Should she stay here, or run after the queen and plead for her life?\nShe never knew why she got to her feet, but she did. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she told them loudly. \u201cThe queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place in the city. There\u2019s thick walls, the moat, the spikes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d demanded a woman she knew slightly, the wife of a lesser lordling. \u201cWhat did Osney tell her? Is the king hurt, has the city fallen?\u201d\n\u201cTell us,\u201d someone else shouted. One woman asked about her father, another her son.\nSansa raised her hands for quiet. \u201cJoffrey\u2019s come back to the castle. He\u2019s not hurt. They\u2019re still fighting, that\u2019s all I know, they\u2019re fighting bravely. The queen will be back soon.\u201d The last was a lie, but she had to soothe them. She noticed the fools standing under the galley. \u201cMoon Boy, make us laugh.\u201d\nMoon Boy did a cartwheel, and vaulted on top of a table. He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them. Every so often one of them would come down and smash him in the head. A few nervous laughs echoed through the hall. Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside him. His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck him. \u201cMadness,\u201d he gasped. \u201cGods, the Imp was right, was right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHelp him,\u201d Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all. Other servants were leaving the hall as well, but she could not help that. Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. \u201cTake him to Maester Frenken.\u201d Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead. I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not helping him.\nThe torches had begun to burn low, and one or two had flickered out. No one troubled to replace them. Cersei did not return. Ser Dontos climbed the dais while all eyes were on the other fool. \u201cGo back to your bedchamber, sweet Jonquil,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLock yourself in, you\u2019ll be safer there. I\u2019ll come for you when the battle\u2019s done.\u201d\nSomeone will come for me, Sansa thought, but will it be you, or will it be Ser Ilyn? For a mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend her. He had been a knight too, trained with the sword and sworn to defend the weak. No. He has not the courage, or the skill. I would only be killing him as well.\nIt took all the strength she had in her to walk slowly from the Queen\u2019s Ballroom when she wanted so badly to run. When she reached the steps, she did run, up and around until she was breathless and dizzy. One of the guards knocked into her on the stair. A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he\u2019d wrapped them in and went clattering down the steps. He hurried after them, paying Sansa no mind once he decided she was not going to try and take his loot.\nHer bedchamber was black as pitch. Sansa barred the door and fumbled through the dark to the window. When she ripped back the drapes, her breath caught in her throat.\nThe southern sky was aswirl with glowing, shifting colors, the reflections of the great fires that burned below. Baleful green tides moved against the bellies of the clouds, and pools of orange light spread out across the heavens. The reds and yellows of common flame warred against the emeralds and jades of wildfire, each color flaring and then fading, birthing armies of short-lived shadows to die again an instant later. Green dawns gave way to orange dusks in half a heartbeat. The air itself smelled burnt, the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if it was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away. Embers drifted through the night air like swarms of fireflies.\nSansa backed away from the window, retreating toward the safety of her bed. I\u2019ll go to sleep, she told herself, and when I wake it will be a new day, and the sky will be blue again. The fighting will be done and someone will tell me whether I\u2019m to live or die. \u201cLady,\u201d she whimpered softly, wondering if she would meet her wolf again when she was dead.\nThen something stirred behind her, and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her wrist.\nSansa opened her mouth to scream, but another hand clamped down over her face, smothering her. His fingers were rough and callused, and sticky with blood. \u201cLittle bird. I knew you\u2019d come.\u201d The voice was a drunken rasp.\nOutside, a swirling lance of jade light spit at the stars, filling the room with green glare. She saw him for a moment, all black and green, the blood on his face dark as tar, his eyes glowing like a dog\u2019s in the sudden glare. Then the light faded and he was only a hulking darkness in a stained white cloak.\n\u201cIf you scream I\u2019ll kill you. Believe that.\u201d He took his hand from her mouth. Her breath was coming ragged. The Hound had a flagon of wine on her bedside table. He took a long pull. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask who\u2019s winning the battle, little bird?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d she said, too frightened to defy him.\nThe Hound laughed. \u201cI only know who\u2019s lost. Me.\u201d\nHe is drunker than I\u2019ve ever seen him. He was sleeping in my bed. What does he want here? \u201cWhat have you lost?\u201d\n\u201cAll.\u201d The burnt half of his face was a mask of dried blood. \u201cBloody dwarf. Should have killed him. Years ago.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, they say.\u201d\n\u201cDead? No. Bugger that. I don\u2019t want him dead.\u201d He cast the empty flagon aside. \u201cI want him burned. If the gods are good, they\u2019ll burn him, but I won\u2019t be here to see. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cGoing?\u201d She tried to wriggle free, but his grasp was iron.\n\u201cThe little bird repeats whatever she hears. Going, yes.\u201d\n\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d\n\u201cAway from here. Away from the fires. Go out the Iron Gate, I suppose. North somewhere, anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get out,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cThe queen\u2019s closed up Maegor\u2019s, and the city gates are shut as well.\u201d\n\u201cNot to me. I have the white cloak. And I have this.\u201d He patted the pommel of his sword. \u201cThe man who tries to stop me is a dead man. Unless he\u2019s on fire.\u201d He laughed bitterly.\n\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\n\u201cYou promised me a song, little bird. Have you forgotten?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t know what he meant. She couldn\u2019t sing for him now, here, with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me go, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\u201cEverything scares you. Look at me. Look at me.\u201d\nThe blood masked the worst of his scars, but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying. The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again. Sansa could smell him; a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit, and over it all the reek of blood, blood, blood.\n\u201cI could keep you safe,\u201d he rasped. \u201cThey\u2019re all afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d He yanked her closer, and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss her. He was too strong to fight. She closed her eyes, wanting it to be over, but nothing happened. \u201cStill can\u2019t bear to look, can you?\u201d she heard him say. He gave her arm a hard wrench, pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll have that song. Florian and Jonquil, you said.\u201d His dagger was out, poised at her throat. \u201cSing, little bird. Sing for your little life.\u201d\nHer throat was dry and tight with fear, and every song she had ever known had fled from her mind. Please don\u2019t kill me, she wanted to scream, please don\u2019t. She could feel him twisting the point, pushing it into her throat, and she almost closed her eyes again, but then she remembered. It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil, but it was a song. Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears.\nGentle Mother, font of mercy,save our sons from war, we pray,stay the swords and stay the arrows,let them know a better day.Gentle Mother, strength of women,help our daughters through this fray,soothe the wrath and tame the fury,teach us all a kinder way.\nShe had forgotten the other verses. When her voice trailed off, she feared he might kill her, but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat, never speaking.\nSome instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers. The room was too dark for her to see him, but she could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that was not blood. \u201cLittle bird,\u201d he said once more, his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone. Then he rose from the bed. Sansa heard cloth ripping, followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps.\nWhen she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, the white wool stained by blood and fire. The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.\nHow long she stayed there she could not have said, but after a time she heard a bell ringing, far off across the city. The sound was a deep-throated bronze booming, coming faster with each knell. Sansa was wondering what it might mean when a second bell joined in, and a third, their voices calling across the hills and hollows, the alleys and towers, to every corner of King\u2019s Landing. She threw off the cloak and went to her window.\nThe first faint hint of dawn was visible in the east, and the Red Keep\u2019s own bells were ringing now, joining in the swelling river of sound that flowed from the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor. They had rung the bells when King Robert died, she remembered, but this was different, no slow dolorous death knell but a joyful thunder. She could hear men shouting in the streets as well, and something that could only be cheers.\nIt was Ser Dontos who brought her the word. He staggered through her open door, wrapped her in his flabby arms, and whirled her around and around the room, whooping so incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of it. He was as drunk as the Hound had been, but in him it was a dancing happy drunk. She was breathless and dizzy when he let her down. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She clutched at a bedpost. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Tell me!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s done! Done! Done! The city is saved. Lord Stannis is dead , Lord Stannis is fled, no one knows, no one cares, his host is broken, the danger\u2019s done. Slaughtered, scattered, or gone over, they say. Oh, the bright banners! The banners, Jonquil, the banners! Do you have any wine? We ought to drink to this day, yes. It means you\u2019re safe, don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s happened!\u201d Sansa shook him.\nSer Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other, almost falling. \u201cThey came up through the ashes while the river was burning. The river, Stannis was neck deep in the river, and they took him from the rear. Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of it! His own men hardly fought, they say. Some ran but more bent the knee and went over, shouting for Lord Renly! What must Stannis have thought when he heard that? I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon\u2019s back now and his men say the same, and the gold cloaks as well. We\u2019re delivered, sweetling! They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank, through all the fields Stannis had burned, the ashes puffing up around their boots and turning all their armor grey, but oh! the banners must have been bright, the golden rose and golden lion and all the others, the Marbrand tree and the Rowan, Tarly\u2019s huntsman and Redwyne\u2019s grapes and Lady Oakheart\u2019s leaf. All the westermen, all the power of Highgarden and Casterly Rock! Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side of the river, with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left, but the vanguard won the fight. They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin, every man of them howling like some demon in steel. And do you know who led the vanguard? Do you? Do you? Do you?\u201d\n\u201cRobb?\u201d It was too much to be hoped, but\u2026\n\u201cIt was Lord Renly! Lord Renly in his green armor, with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers! Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand! They say he killed Ser Guyard Morrigen himself in single combat, and a dozen other great knights as well. It was Renly, it was Renly, it was Renly! Oh! the banners, darling Sansa! Oh! to be a knight!\u201d",

      "content": "Daenerys\nShe was breaking her fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought her a Qartheen gown, an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls. \u201cTake it away,\u201d Dany said. \u201cThe docks are no place for lady\u2019s finery.\u201d\nIf the Milk Men thought her such a savage, she would dress the part for them. When she went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt. Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki fashion, and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid. \u201cI have won no victories,\u201d she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly.\nJhiqui disagreed. \u201cYou burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell.\u201d\nThat was Drogon\u2019s victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue. The Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair. She chimed as she mounted her silver mare, and again with every stride, but neither Ser Jorah nor her bloodriders made mention of it. To guard her people and her dragons in her absence, she chose Rakharo. Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront.\nThey left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street. There were fewer horses and camels to be seen, and a dearth of palanquins, but the streets teemed with children, beggars, and skinny dogs the color of sand. Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch them pass. They know who I am, and they do not love me. Dany could tell from the way they looked at her.\nSer Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin, safely hidden behind silken curtains, but she refused him. She had reclined too long on satin cushions, letting oxen bear her hither and yon. At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere.\nIt was not by choice that she sought the waterfront. She was fleeing again. Her whole life had been one long flight, it seemed. She had begun running in her mother\u2019s womb, and never once stopped. How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night, a bare step ahead of the Usurper\u2019s hired knives? But it was run or die. Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her.\nDany had laughed when he told her. \u201cWas it not you who told me warlocks were no more than old soldiers, vainly boasting of forgotten deeds and lost prowess?\u201d\nXaro looked troubled. \u201cAnd so it was, then. But now? I am less certain. It is said that the glass candles are burning in the house of Urrathon Night-Walker, that have not burned in a hundred years. Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane, phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock\u2019s Way, and all the rats in the city are chewing off their tails. The wife of Mathos Mallarawan, who once mocked a warlock\u2019s drab moth-eaten robe, has gone mad and will wear no clothes at all. Even fresh-washed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin. And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again, or so his slaves do swear. A man must wonder.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThese are strange times in Qarth. And strange times are bad for trade. It grieves me to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later.\u201d Xaro stroked her fingers reassuringly. \u201cYou need not go alone, though. You have seen dark visions in the Palace of Dust, but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams. I see you happily abed, with our child at your breast. Sail with me around the Jade Sea, and we can yet make it so! It is not too late. Give me a son, my sweet song of joy!\u201d\nGive you a dragon, you mean. \u201cI will not wed you, Xaro.\u201d\nHis face had grown cold at that. \u201cThen go.\u201d\n\u201cBut where?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere far from here.\u201d\nWell, perhaps it was time. The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste, but now that they were plump and rested once again, they began to grow unruly. Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place. They were a warrior people, not made for cities. Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long, seduced by its comforts and its beauties. It was a city that always promised more than it would give you, it seemed to her, and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame. Overnight the Qartheen had come to remember that dragons were dangerous. No longer did they vie with each other to give her gifts. Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion, and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death. It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from joining them.\nBut where am I to go? Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east, away from her enemies in the Seven Kingdoms. Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea, even if it meant braving the red waste again. Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong. But her heart was full of doubts. Each of these felt wrong, somehow\u2026 and even when she decided where to go, the question of how she would get there remained troublesome.\nXaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her, she knew that now. For all his professions of devotion, he was playing his own game, not unlike Pyat Pree. The night he asked her to leave, Dany had begged one last favor of him. \u201cAn army, is it?\u201d Xaro asked. \u201cA kettle of gold? A galley, perhaps?\u201d\nDany blushed. She hated begging. \u201cA ship, yes.\u201d\nXaro\u2019s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose. \u201cI am a trader, Khaleesi. So perhaps we should speak no more of giving, but rather of trade. For one of your dragons, you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet. You need only say that one sweet word.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d Xaro sobbed, \u201cthat was not the word I meant.\u201d\n\u201cWould you ask a mother to sell one of her children?\u201d\n\u201cWhyever not? They can always make more. Mothers sell their children every day.\u201d\n\u201cNot the Mother of Dragons.\u201d\n\u201cNot even for twenty ships?\u201d\n\u201cNot for a hundred.\u201d\nHis mouth curled downward. \u201cI do not have a hundred. But you have three dragons. Grant me one, for all my kindnesses. You will still have two and thirty ships as well.\u201d\nThirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros. But I do not have a small army. \u201cHow many ships do you own, Xaro?\u201d\n\u201cEighty-three, if one does not count my pleasure barge.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your colleagues in the Thirteen?\u201d\n\u201cAmong us all, perhaps a thousand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood?\u201d\n\u201cTheir trifling fleets are of no account.\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d she said, \u201ctell me.\u201d\n\u201cTwelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers. No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Asshai\u2019i, the Braavosi, the Summer Islanders, the Ibbenese, and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea, how many ships do they have? All together?\u201d\n\u201cMany and more,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cWhat does this matter?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world.\u201d Dany smiled at him sweetly. \u201cit seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair.\u201d\nXaro\u2019s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose. \u201cDid I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust? This is the very thing I feared. The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan\u2019s wife. A third of all the ships in the world? Pah. Pah, I say. Pah.\u201d\nDany had not seen him since. His seneschal brought her messages, each cooler than the last. She must quit his house. He was done feeding her and her people. He demanded the return of his gifts, which she had accepted in bad faith. Her only consolation was that at least she\u2019d had the great good sense not to marry him.\nThe warlocks whispered of three treasons\u2026 once for blood and once for gold and once for love. The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur, who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people. Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third? She did not think so. What Pyat did was not for gold, and Xaro had never truly loved her.\nThe streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses. Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind, leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side. Her bell rang softly, and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more, as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth. Child of three, they had called her, daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire. So many threes. Three fires, three mounts to ride, three treasons. \u201cThe dragon has three heads,\u201d she sighed. \u201cDo you know what that means, Jorah?\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace? The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon, red on black.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. But there are no three-headed dragons.\u201d\n\u201cThe three heads were Aegon and his sisters.\u201d\n\u201cVisenya and Rhaenys,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys.\u201d\n\u201cBlue lips speak only lies, isn\u2019t that what Xaro told you? Why do you care what the warlocks whispered? All they wanted was to suck the life from you, you know that now.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cYet the things I saw\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA dead man in the prow of a ship, a blue rose, a banquet of blood\u2026 what does any of it mean, Khaleesi? A mummer\u2019s dragon, you said. What is a mummer\u2019s dragon, pray?\u201d\n\u201cA cloth dragon on poles,\u201d Dany explained. \u201cMummers use them in their follies, to give the heroes something to fight.\u201d\nSer Jorah frowned.\nDany could not let it go. \u201cHis is the song of ice and fire, my brother said. I\u2019m certain it was my brother. Not Viserys, Rhaegar. He had a harp with silver strings.\u201d\nSer Jorah\u2019s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together. \u201cPrince Rhaegar played such a harp,\u201d he conceded. \u201cYou saw him?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cThere was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast. My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Aegon was Rhaegar\u2019s heir by Elia of Dorne,\u201d Ser Jorah said. \u201cBut if he was this prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall.\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d Dany said sadly. \u201cThey murdered Rhaegar\u2019s daughter as well, the little princess. Rhaenys, she was named, like Aegon\u2019s sister. There was no Visenya, but he said the dragon has three heads. What is the song of ice and fire?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no song I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cI went to the warlocks hoping for answers, but instead they\u2019ve left me with a hundred new questions.\u201d\nBy then there were people in the streets once more. \u201cMake way,\u201d Aggo shouted, while Jhogo sniffed at the air suspiciously. \u201cI smell it, Khaleesi,\u201d he called. \u201cThe poison water.\u201d The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon it. Water that a horse could not drink was water they wanted no part of. They will learn, Dany resolved. I braved their sea with Khal Drogo. Now they can brave mine.\nQarth was one of the world\u2019s great ports, its great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells. Winesinks, warehouses, and gaming dens lined the streets, cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods. Cutpurses, cutthroats, spellsellers, and moneychangers mingled with every crowd. The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night, and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar, if a man did not ask where they came from. Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat\u2019s milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders. Seamen from half a hundred nations wandered amongst the stalls, drinking spiced liquors and trading jokes in queer-sounding tongues. The air smelled of salt and frying fish, of hot tar and honey, of incense and oil and sperm.\nAggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled them as he rode. Jhogo bought a handful of fat white cherries. Elsewhere they saw beautiful bronze daggers for sale, dried squids and carved onyx, a potent magical elixir made of virgin\u2019s milk and shade of the evening, even dragon\u2019s eggs which looked suspiciously like painted rocks.\nAs they passed the long stone quays reserved for the ships of the Thirteen, she saw chests of saffron, frankincense, and pepper being off-loaded from Xaro\u2019s ornate Vermillion Kiss. Beside her, casks of wine, bales of sourleaf, and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure, to sail on the evening tide. Farther along, a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves. It was well known that the cheapest place to buy a slave was right off the ship, and the banners floating from her masts proclaimed that the Sunblaze had just arrived from Astapor on Slaver\u2019s Bay.\nDany would get no help from the Thirteen, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, or the Ancient Guild of Spicers. She rode her silver past several miles of their quays, docks, and storehouses, all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer Islands, Westeros, and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock.\nShe dismounted beside a gaming pit where a basilisk was tearing a big red dog to pieces amidst a shouting ring of sailors. \u201cAggo, Jhogo, you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the captains.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, Khaleesi. We will watch you as you go.\u201d\nIt was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more, and even the Common Tongue, Dany thought as they approached the first ship. Sailors, dockworkers, and merchants alike gave way before her, not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side. Despite the heat of the day, Ser Jorah wore his green wool surcoat over chainmail, the black bear of Mormont sewn on his chest.\nBut neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships they needed.\n\u201cYou require passage for a hundred Dothraki, all their horses, yourself and this knight, and three dragons?\u201d said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before he walked away laughing. When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, he gave her a deadface look and said, \u201cAye, and I\u2019m Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night.\u201d The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea, where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire. The owner of Lord Faro\u2019s Belly would risk dragons, but not Dothraki. \u201cI\u2019ll have no such godless savages in my Belly, I\u2019ll not.\u201d The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red. They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time, but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means, and might have been beyond Xaro\u2019s. Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for her needs, Bravo was bound for the Jade Sea, and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy.\nAs they made their way toward the next quay, Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of her back. \u201cYour Grace. You are being followed. No, do not turn.\u201d He guided her gently toward a brass-seller\u2019s booth. \u201cThis is a noble work, my queen,\u201d he proclaimed loudly, lifting a large platter for her inspection. \u201cSee how it shines in the sun?\u201d\nThe brass was polished to a high sheen. Dany could see her face in it\u2026 and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right, she could see behind her. \u201cI see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff. Which is it?\u201d\n\u201cBoth of them,\u201d Ser Jorah said. \u201cThey have been following us since we left Quicksilver.\u201d\nThe ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly, making one man seem long and gaunt, the other immensely squat and broad. \u201cA most excellent brass, great lady,\u201d the merchant exclaimed. \u201cBright as the sun! And for the Mother of Dragons, only thirty honors.\u201d\nThe platter was worth no more than three. \u201cWhere are my guards?\u201d Dany declared. \u201cThis man is trying to rob me!\u201d For Jorah, she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue. \u201cThey may not mean me ill. Men have looked at women since time began, perhaps it is no more than that.\u201d\nThe brass-seller ignored their whispers. \u201cThirty? Did I say thirty? Such a fool I am. The price is twenty honors.\u201d\n\u201cAll the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors,\u201d Dany told him as she studied the reflections. The old man had the look of Westeros about him, and the brown-skinned one must weigh twenty stone. The Usurper offered a lordship to the man who kills me, and these two are far from home. Or could they be creatures of the warlocks, meant to take me unawares?\n\u201cTen, Khaleesi, because you are so lovely. Use it for a looking glass. Only brass this fine could capture such beauty.\u201d\n\u201cIt might serve to carry nightsoil. If you threw it away, I might pick it up, so long as I did not need to stoop. But pay for it?\u201d Dany shoved the platter back into his hands. \u201cWorms have crawled up your nose and eaten your wits.\u201d\n\u201cEight honors,\u201d he cried. \u201cMy wives will beat me and call me fool, but I am a helpless child in your hands. Come, eight, that is less than it is worth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold?\u201d As she turned to walk off, Dany let her glance sweep over the strangers. The brown man was near as wide as he\u2019d looked in the platter, with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks of a eunuch. A long curving arakh was thrust through the sweat-stained yellow silk of his bellyband. Above the silk, he was naked but for an absurdly tiny iron-studded vest. Old scars crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms, huge chest, and massive belly, pale against his nut-brown skin.\nThe other man wore a traveler\u2019s cloak of undyed wool, the hood thrown back. Long white hair fell to his shoulders, and a silky white beard covered the lower half of his face. He leaned his weight on a hardwood staff as tall as he was. Only fools would stare so openly if they meant me harm. All the same, it might be prudent to head back toward Jhogo and Aggo. \u201cThe old man does not wear a sword,\u201d she said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as she drew him away.\nThe brass merchant came hopping after them. \u201cFive honors, for five it is yours, it was meant for you.\u201d\nSer Jorah said, \u201cA hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace.\u201d\n\u201cFour! I know you want it!\u201d He danced in front of them, scampering backward as he thrust the platter at their faces.\n\u201cDo they follow?\u201d\n\u201cLift that up a little higher,\u201d the knight told the merchant. \u201cYes. The old man pretends to linger at a potter\u2019s stall, but the brown one has eyes only for you.\u201d\n\u201cTwo honors! Two! Two!\u201d The merchant was panting heavily from the effort of running backward.\n\u201cPay him before he kills himself,\u201d Dany told Ser Jorah, wondering what she was going to do with a huge brass platter. She turned back as he reached for his coins, intending to put an end to this mummer\u2019s farce. The blood of the dragon would not be herded through the bazaar by an old man and a fat eunuch.\nA Qartheen stepped into her path. \u201cMother of Dragons, for you.\u201d He knelt and thrust a jewel box into her face.\nDany took it almost by reflex. The box was carved wood, its mother-of-pearl lid inlaid with jasper and chalcedony. \u201cYou are too generous.\u201d She opened it. Within was a glittering green scarab carved from onyx and emerald. Beautiful, she thought. This will help pay for our passage. As she reached inside the box, the man said, \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d but she hardly heard.\nThe scarab unfolded with a hiss.\nDany caught a glimpse of a malign black face, almost human, and an arched tail dripping venom\u2026 and then the box flew from her hand in pieces, turning end over end. Sudden pain twisted her fingers. As she cried out and clutched her hand, the brass merchant let out a shriek, a woman screamed, and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other aside. Ser Jorah slammed past her, and Dany stumbled to one knee. She heard the hiss again. The old man drove the butt of his staff into the ground, Aggo came riding through an eggseller\u2019s stall and vaulted from his saddle, Jhogo\u2019s whip cracked overhead, Ser Jorah slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter, sailors and whores and merchants were fleeing or shouting or both\u2026\n\u201cYour Grace, a thousand pardons.\u201d The old man knelt. \u201cIt\u2019s dead. Did I break your hand?\u201d\nShe closed her fingers, wincing. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cI had to knock it away,\u201d he started, but her bloodriders were on him before he could finish. Aggo kicked his staff away and Jhogo seized him round the shoulders, forced him to his knees, and pressed a dagger to his throat. \u201cKhaleesi, we saw him strike you. Would you see the color of his blood?\u201d\n\u201cRelease him.\u201d Dany climbed to her feet. \u201cLook at the bottom of his staff, blood of my blood.\u201d Ser Jorah had been shoved off his feet by the eunuch. She ran between them as arakh and longsword both came flashing from their sheaths. \u201cPut down your steel! Stop it!\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Mormont lowered his sword only an inch. \u201cThese men attacked you.\u201d\n\u201cThey were defending me.\u201d Dany snapped her hand to shake the sting from her fingers. \u201cIt was the other one, the Qartheen.\u201d When she looked around he was gone. \u201cHe was a Sorrowful Man. There was a manticore in that jewel box he gave me. This man knocked it out of my hand.\u201d The brass merchant was still rolling on the ground. She went to him and helped him to his feet. \u201cWere you stung?\u201d\n\u201cNo, good lady,\u201d he said, shaking, \u201cor else I would be dead. But it touched me, aieeee, when it fell from the box it landed on my arm.\u201d He had soiled himself, she saw, and no wonder.\nShe gave him a silver for his trouble and sent him on his way before she turned back to the old man with the white beard. \u201cWho is it that I owe my life to?\u201d\n\u201cYou owe me nothing, Your Grace. I am called Arstan, though Belwas named me Whitebeard on the voyage here.\u201d Though Jhogo had released him the old man remained on one knee. Aggo picked up his staff, turned it over, cursed softly in Dothraki, scraped the remains of the manticore off on a stone, and handed it back.\n\u201cAnd who is Belwas?\u201d she asked.\nThe huge brown eunuch swaggered forward, sheathing his arakh. \u201cI am Belwas. Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen. Never did I lose.\u201d He slapped his belly, covered with scars. \u201cI let each man cut me once, before I kill him. Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain.\u201d\nDany had no need to count his scars; there were many, she could see at a glance. \u201cAnd why are you here, Strong Belwas?\u201d\n\u201cFrom Meereen I am sold to Qohor, and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in his hair. He it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea, and old Whitebeard to serve him.\u201d\nThe fat man with sweet stink in his hair\u2026\u201cIllyrio?\u201d she said. \u201cYou were sent by Magister Illyrio?\u201d\n\u201cWe were, Your Grace,\u201d old Whitebeard replied. \u201cThe Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending us in his stead, but he cannot sit a horse as he did in his youth, and sea travel upsets his digestion.\u201d Earlier he had spoken in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, but now he changed to the Common Tongue. \u201cI regret if we caused you alarm. If truth be told, we were not certain, we expected someone more\u2026 more\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRegal?\u201d Dany laughed. She had no dragon with her, and her raiment was hardly queenly. \u201cYou speak the Common Tongue well, Arstan. Are you of Westeros?\u201d\n\u201cI am. I was born on the Dornish Marches, Your Grace. As a boy I squired for a knight of Lord Swann\u2019s household.\u201d He held the tall staff upright beside him like a lance in need of a banner. \u201cNow I squire for Belwas.\u201d\n\u201cA bit old for such, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ser Jorah had shouldered his way to her side, holding the brass platter awkwardly under his arm. Belwas\u2019s hard head had left it badly bent.\n\u201cNot too old to serve my liege, Lord Mormont.\u201d\n\u201cYou know me as well?\u201d\n\u201cI saw you fight a time or two. At Lannisport where you near unhorsed the Kingslayer. And on Pyke, there as well. You do not recall, Lord Mormont?\u201d\nSer Jorah frowned. \u201cYour face seems familiar, but there were hundreds at Lannisport and thousands on Pyke. And I am no lord. Bear Island was taken from me. I am but a knight.\u201d\n\u201cA knight of my Queensguard.\u201d Dany took his arm. \u201cAnd my true friend and good counselor.\u201d She studied Arstan\u2019s face. He had a great dignity to him, a quiet strength she liked. \u201cRise, Arstan Whitebeard. Be welcome, Strong Belwas. Ser Jorah you know. Ko Aggo and Ko Jhogo are blood of my blood. They crossed the red waste with me, and saw my dragons born.\u201d\n\u201cHorse boys.\u201d Belwas grinned toothily. \u201cBelwas has killed many horse boys in the fighting pits. They jingle when they die.\u201d\nAggo\u2019s arakh leapt to his hand. \u201cNever have I killed a fat brown man. Belwas will be the first.\u201d\n\u201cSheath your steel, blood of my blood,\u201d said Dany, \u201cthis man comes to serve me. Belwas, you will accord all respect to my people, or you will leave my service sooner than you\u2019d wish, and with more scars than when you came.\u201d\nThe gap-toothed smile faded from the giant\u2019s broad brown face, replaced by a confused scowl. Men did not often threaten Belwas, it would seem, and less so girls a third his size.\nDany gave him a smile, to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke. \u201cNow tell me, what would Magister Illyrio have of me, that he would send you all the way from Pentos?\u201d\n\u201cHe would have dragons,\u201d said Belwas gruffly, \u201cand the girl who makes them. He would have you.\u201d\n\u201cBelwas has the truth of us, Your Grace,\u201d said Arstan. \u201cWe were told to find you and bring you back to Pentos. The Seven Kingdoms have need of you. Robert the Usurper is dead, and the realm bleeds. When we set sail from Pentos there were four kings in the land, and no justice to be had.\u201d\nJoy bloomed in her heart, but Dany kept it from her face. \u201cI have three dragons,\u201d she said, \u201cand more than a hundred in my khalasar, with all their goods and horses.\u201d\n\u201cit is no matter,\u201d boomed Belwas. \u201cWe take all. The fat man hires three ships for his little silverhair queen.\u201d\n\u201cIt is so, Your Grace,\u201d Arstan Whitebeard said. \u201cThe great cog Saduleon is berthed at the end of the quay, and the galleys Summer Sun and Joso\u2019s Prank are anchored beyond the breakwater.\u201d\nThree heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering. \u201cI shall tell my people to make ready to depart at once. But the ships that bring me home must bear different names.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d said Arstan. \u201cWhat names would you prefer?\u201d\n\u201cVhagar,\u201d Daenerys told him. \u201cMeraxes. And Balerion. Paint the names on their hulls in golden letters three feet high, Arstan. I want every man who sees them to know the dragons are returned.\u201d",

      "content": "Arya\nThe heads had been dipped in tar to slow the rot. Every morning when Arya went to the well to draw fresh water for Roose Bolton\u2019s basin, she had to pass beneath them. They faced outward, so she never saw their faces, but she liked to pretend that one of them was Joffrey\u2019s. She tried to picture how his pretty face would look dipped in tar. If I was a crow I could fly down and peck off his stupid fat pouty lips.\nThe heads never lacked for attendants. The carrion crows wheeled about the gatehouse in raucous unkindness and quarreled upon the ramparts over every eye, screaming and cawing at each other and taking to the air whenever a sentry passed along the battlements. Sometimes the maester\u2019s ravens joined the feast as well, flapping down from the rookery on wide black wings. When the ravens came the crows would scatter, only to return the moment the larger birds were gone.\nDo the ravens remember Maester Tothmure? Arya wondered. Are they sad for him? When they quork at him, do they wonder why he doesn\u2019t answer? Perhaps the dead could speak to them in some secret tongue the living could not hear.\nTothmure had been sent to the axe for dispatching birds to Casterly Rock and King\u2019s Landing the night Harrenhal had fallen, Lucan the armorer for making weapons for the Lannisters, Goodwife Harra for telling Lady Whent\u2019s household to serve them, the steward for giving Lord Tywin the keys to the treasure vault. The cook was spared (some said because he\u2019d made the weasel soup), but stocks were hammered together for pretty Pia and the other women who\u2019d shared their favors with Lannister soldiers. Stripped and shaved, they were left in the middle ward beside the bear pit, free for the use of any man who wanted them.\nThree Frey men-at-arms were using them that morning as Arya went to the well. She tried not to look, but she could hear the men laughing. The pail was very heavy once full. She was turning to bring it back to Kingspyre when Goodwife Amabel seized her arm. The water went sloshing over the side onto Amabel\u2019s legs. \u201cYou did that on purpose,\u201d the woman screeched.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Arya squirmed in her grasp. Amabel had been half-crazed since they\u2019d cut Harra\u2019s head off.\n\u201cSee there?\u201d Arnabel pointed across the yard at Pia. \u201cWhen this northman falls you\u2019ll be where she is.\u201d\n\u201cLet me go.\u201d She tried to wrench free, but Amabel only tightened her fingers.\n\u201cHe will fall too, Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end. Lord Tywin\u2019s won now, he\u2019ll be marching back with all his power, and then it will be his turn to punish the disloyal. And don\u2019t think he won\u2019t know what you did!\u201d The old woman laughed. \u201cI may have a turn at you myself. Harra had an old broom, I\u2019ll save it for you. The handle\u2019s cracked and splintery\u2014\u201d\nArya swung the bucket. The weight of the water made it turn in her hands, so she didn\u2019t smash Amabel\u2019s head in as she wanted, but the woman let go of her anyway when the water came out and drenched her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever touch me,\u201d Arya shouted, \u201cor I\u2019ll kill you. You get away.\u201d\nSopping, Goodwife Amabel jabbed a thin finger at the flayed man on the front of Arya\u2019s tunic. \u201cYou think you\u2019re safe with that little bloody man on your teat, but you\u2019re not! The Lannisters are coming! See what happens when they get here.\u201d\nThree-quarters of the water had splashed out on the ground, so Arya had to return to the well. If I told Lord Bolton what she said, her head would be up next to Harra\u2019s before it got dark, she thought as she drew up the bucket again. She wouldn\u2019t, though.\nOnce, when there had been only half as many heads, Gendry had caught Arya looking at them. \u201cAdmiring your work?\u201d he asked.\nHe was angry because he\u2019d liked Lucan, she knew, but it still wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cIt\u2019s Steelshanks Walton\u2019s work,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cAnd the Mummers, and Lord Bolton.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who gave us all them? You and your weasel soup.\u201d\nArya punched his arm. \u201cIt was just hot broth. You hated Ser Amory too.\u201d\n\u201cI hate this lot worse. Ser Amory was fighting for his lord, but the Mummers are sellswords and turncloaks. Half of them can\u2019t even speak the Common Tongue. Septon Utt likes little boys, Qyburn does black magic, and your friend Biter eats people.\u201d\nThe worst thing was, she couldn\u2019t even say he was wrong. The Brave Companions did most of the foraging for Harrenhal, and Roose Bolton had given them the task of rooting out Lannisters. Vargo Hoat had divided them into four bands, to visit as many villages as possible. He led the largest group himself, and gave the others to his most trusted captains. She had heard Rorge laughing over Lord Vargo\u2019s way of finding traitors. All he did was return to places he had visited before under Lord Tywin\u2019s banner and seize those who had helped him. Many had been bought with Lannister silver, so the Mummers often returned with bags of coin as well as baskets of heads. \u201cA riddle!\u201d Shagwell would shout gleefully. \u201cIf Lord Bolton\u2019s goat eats the men who fed Lord Lannister\u2019s goat, how many goats are there?\u201d\n\u201cOne,\u201d Arya said when he asked her.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a weasel clever as a goat!\u201d the fool tittered.\nRorge and Biter were as bad as the others. Whenever Lord Bolton took a meal with the garrison, Arya would see them there among the rest. Biter gave off a stench like bad cheese, so the Brave Companions made him sit down near the foot of the table where he could grunt and hiss to himself and tear his meat apart with fingers and teeth. He would sniff at Arya when she passed, but it was Rorge who scared her most. He sat up near Faithful Ursywck, but she could feel his eyes crawling over her as she went about her duties.\nSometimes she wished she had gone off across the narrow sea with Jaqen H\u2019ghar. She still had the stupid coin he\u2019d given her, a piece of iron no larger than a penny and rusted along the rim. One side had writing on it, queer words she could not read. The other showed a man\u2019s head, but so worn that all his features had rubbed off. He said it was of great value, but that was probably a lie too, like his name and even his face. That made her so angry that she threw the coin away, but after an hour she got to feeling bad and went and found it again, even though it wasn\u2019t worth anything.\nShe was thinking about the coin as she crossed the Flowstone Yard, struggling with the weight of the water in her pail. \u201cNan,\u201d a voice called out. \u201cPut down that pail and come help me.\u201d\nElmar Frey was no older than she was, and short for his age besides. He had been rolling a barrel of sand across the uneven stone, and was red-faced from exertion. Arya went to help him. Together they pushed the barrel all the way to the wall and back again, then stood it upright.\nShe could hear the sand shifting around inside as Elmar pried open the lid and pulled out a chainmail hauberk. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s clean enough?\u201d As Roose Bolton\u2019s squire, it was his task to keep his mail shiny bright.\n\u201cYou need to shake out the sand. There\u2019s still spots of rust. See?\u201d She pointed. \u201cYou\u2019d best do it again.\u201d\n\u201cYou do it.\u201d Elmar could be friendly when he needed help, but afterward he would always remember that he was a squire and she was only a serving girl, He liked to boast how he was the son of the Lord of the Crossing, not a nephew or a bastard or a grandson but a trueborn son, and on account of that he was going to marry a princess.\nArya didn\u2019t care about his precious princess, and didn\u2019t like him giving her commands. \u201cI have to bring m\u2019lord water for his basin. He\u2019s in his bedchamber being leeched. Not the regular black leeches but the big pale ones.\u201d\nElmar\u2019s eyes got as big as boiled eggs. Leeches terrified him, especially the big pale ones that looked like jelly until they filled up with blood. \u201cI forgot, you\u2019re too skinny to push such a heavy barrel.\u201d\n\u201cI forgot, you\u2019re stupid.\u201d Arya picked up the pail. \u201cMaybe you should get leeched too. There\u2019s leeches in the Neck as big as pigs.\u201d She left him there with his barrel.\nThe lord\u2019s bedchamber was crowded when she entered. Qyburn was in attendance, and dour Walton in his mail shirt and greaves, plus a dozen Freys, all brothers, half brothers, and cousins. Roose Bolton lay abed, naked. Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and dotted his pallid chest, long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as they fed. Bolton paid them no more mind than he did Arya.\n\u201cWe must not allow Lord Tywin to trap us here at Harrenhal,\u201d Ser Aenys Frey was saying as Arya filled the washbasin. A grey stooped giant of a man with watery red eyes and huge gnarled hands, Ser Aenys had brought fifteen hundred Frey swords south to Harrenhal, yet it often seemed as if he were helpless to command even his own brothers. \u201cThe castle is so large it requires an army to hold it, and once surrounded we cannot feed an army. Nor can we hope to lay in sufficient supplies. The country is ash, the villages given over to wolves, the harvest burnt or stolen. Autumn is on us, yet there is no food in store and none being planted. We live on forage, and if the Lannisters deny that to us, we will be down to rats and shoe leather in a moon\u2019s turn.\u201d\n\u201cI do not mean to be besieged here.\u201d Roose Bolton\u2019s voice was so soft that men had to strain to hear it, so his chambers were always strangely hushed.\n\u201cWhat, then?\u201d demanded Ser Jared Frey, who was lean, balding, and pockmarked. \u201cIs Edmure Tully so drunk on his victory that he thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the open field?\u201d\nIf he does he\u2019ll beat them, Arya thought. He\u2019ll beat them as he did on the Red Fork, you\u2019ll see. Unnoticed, she went to stand by Qyburn.\n\u201cLord Tywin is many leagues from here,\u201d Bolton said calmly. \u201cHe has many matters yet to settle at King\u2019s Landing. He will not march on Harrenhal for some time.\u201d\nSer Aenys shook his head stubbornly. \u201cYou do not know the Lannisters as we do, my lord. King Stannis thought that Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well, and it undid him.\u201d\nThe pale man in the bed smiled faintly as the leeches nursed of his blood. \u201cI am not a man to be undone, ser.\u201d\n\u201cEven if Riverrun marshals all its strength and the Young Wolf wins back from the west, how can we hope to match the numbers Lord Tywin can send against us? When he comes, he will come with far more power than he commanded on the Green Fork. Highgarden has joined itself to Joffrey\u2019s cause, I remind you!\u201d\n\u201cI had not forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cI have been Lord Tywin\u2019s captive once,\u201d said Ser Hosteen, a husky man with a square face who was said to be the strongest of the Freys. \u201cI have no wish to enjoy Lannister hospitality again.\u201d\nSer Harys Haigh, who was a Frey on his mother\u2019s side, nodded vigorously. \u201cIf Lord Tywin could defeat a seasoned man like Stannis Baratheon, what chance will our boy king have against him?\u201d He looked round to his brothers and cousins for support, and several of them muttered agreement.\n\u201cSomeone must have the courage to say it,\u201d Ser Hosteen said. \u201cThe war is lost. King Robb must be made to see that.\u201d\nRoose Bolton studied him with pale eyes. \u201cHis Grace has defeated the Lannisters every time he has faced them in battle.\u201d\n\u201cHe has lost the north,\u201d insisted Hosteen Frey. \u201cHe has lost Winterfell! His brothers are dead\u2026\u201d\nFor a moment Arya forgot to breathe. Dead? Bran and Rickon, dead? What does he mean? What does he mean about Winterfell, Joffrey could never take Winterfell, never, Robb would never let him. Then she remembered that Robb was not at Winterfell. He was away in the west, and Bran was crippled, and Rickon only four. It took all her strength to remain still and silent, the way Syrio Forel had taught her, to stand there like a stick of furniture. She felt tears gathering in her eyes, and willed them away. It\u2019s not true, it can\u2019t be true, it\u2019s just some Lannister lie.\n\u201cHad Stannis won, all might have been different,\u201d Ronel Rivers said wistfully. He was one of Lord Walder\u2019s bastards.\n\u201cStannis lost,\u201d Ser Hosteen said bluntly. \u201cWishing it were otherwise will not make it so. King Robb must make his peace with the Lannisters. He must put off his crown and bend the knee, little as he may like it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who will tell him so?\u201d Roose Bolton smiled. \u201cIt is a fine thing to have so many valiant brothers in such troubled times. I shall think on all you\u2019ve said.\u201d\nHis smile was dismissal. The Freys made their courtesies and shuffled out, leaving only Qyburn, Steelshanks Walton, and Arya. Lord Bolton beckoned her closer. \u201cI am bled sufficiently. Nan, you may remove the leeches.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, my lord.\u201d It was best never to make Roose Bolton ask twice. Arya wanted to ask him what Ser Hosteen had meant about Winterfell, but she dared not. I\u2019ll ask Elmar, she thought. Elmar will tell me. The leeches wriggled slowly between her fingers as she plucked them carefully from the lord\u2019s body, their pale bodies moist to the touch and distended with blood. They\u2019re only leeches, she reminded herself. If I closed my hand, they\u2019d squish between my fingers.\n\u201cThere is a letter from your lady wife.\u201d Qyburn pulled a roll of parchment from his sleeve. Though he wore maester\u2019s robes, there was no chain about his neck; it was whispered that he had lost it for dabbling in necromancy.\n\u201cYou may read it,\u201d Bolton said.\nThe Lady Walda wrote from the Twins almost every day, but all the letters were the same. \u201cI pray for you morn, noon, and night, my sweet lord,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand count the days until you share my bed again. Return to me soon, and I will give you many trueborn sons to take the place of your dear Domeric and rule the Dreadfort after you.\u201d Arya pictured a plump pink baby in a cradle, covered with plump pink leeches.\nShe brought Lord Bolton a damp washcloth to wipe down his soft hairless body. \u201cI will send a letter of my own,\u201d he told the onetime maester.\n\u201cTo the Lady Walda?\u201d\n\u201cTo Ser Helman Tallhart.\u201d\nA rider from Ser Helman had come two days past. Tallhart men had taken the castle of the Darrys, accepting the surrender of its Lannister garrison after a brief siege.\n\u201cTell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the king. Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale. Those are rich lands, and hardly touched by the fighting. It is time they had a taste. Glover has lost a castle, and Tallhart a son. Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale.\u201d\n\u201cI shall prepare the message for your seal, my lord.\u201d\nArya was glad to hear that the castle of the Darrys would be burned. That was where they\u2019d brought her when she\u2019d been caught after her fight with Joffrey, and where the queen had made her father kill Sansa\u2019s wolf. It deserves to burn. She wished that Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart would come back to Harrenhal, though; they had marched too quickly, before she\u2019d been able to decide whether to trust them with her secret.\n\u201cI will hunt today,\u201d Roose Bolton announced as Qyburn helped him into a quilted jerkin.\n\u201cIs it safe, my lord?\u201d Qyburn asked. \u201cOnly three days past, Septon Utt\u2019s men were attacked by wolves. They came right into his camp, not five yards from the fire, and killed two horses.\u201d\n\u201cIt is wolves I mean to hunt. I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling.\u201d Bolton buckled on his belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger. \u201cIt\u2019s said that direwolves once roamed the north in great packs of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, but that was long ago and in another land. It is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold.\u201d\n\u201cTerrible times breed terrible things, my lord.\u201d\nBolton showed his teeth in something that might have been a smile. \u201cAre these times so terrible, Maester?\u201d\n\u201cSummer is gone and there are four kings in the realm.\u201d\n\u201cOne king may be terrible, but four?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNan, my fur cloak.\u201d She brought it to him. \u201cMy chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return,\u201d he told her as she fastened it. \u201cAnd tend to Lady Walda\u2019s letter.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d\nThe lord and maester swept from the room, giving her not so much as a backward glance. When they were gone, Arya took the letter and carried it to the hearth, stirring the logs with a poker to wake the flames anew. She watched the parchment twist, blacken, and flare up. If the Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon, Robb will kill them every one. He\u2019ll never bend the knee, never, never, never. He\u2019s not afraid of any of them. Curls of ash floated up the chimney. Arya squatted beside the fire, watching them rise through a veil of hot tears. If Winterfell is truly gone, is this my home now? Am I still Arya, or only Nan the serving girl, for forever and forever and forever?\nShe spent the next few hours tending to the lord\u2019s chambers. She swept out the old rushes and scattered fresh sweet-smelling ones, laid a fresh fire in the hearth, changed the linens and fluffed the featherbed, emptied the chamber pots down the privy shaft and scrubbed them out, carried an armload of soiled clothing to the washerwomen, and brought up a bowl of crisp autumn pears from the kitchen. When she was done with the bedchamber, she went down half a flight of stairs to do the same in the great solar, a spare drafty room as large as the halls of many a smaller castle. The candles were down to stubs, so Arya changed them out. Under the windows was a huge oaken table where the lord wrote his letters. She stacked the books, changed the candles, put the quills and inks and sealing wax in order.\nA large ragged sheepskin was tossed across the papers. Arya had started to roll it up when the colors caught her eye: the blue of lakes and rivers, the red dots where castles and cities could be found, the green of woods. She spread it out instead. THE LANDS OF THE TRIDENT, said the ornate script beneath the map. The drawing showed everything from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush. There\u2019s Harrenhal at the top of the big lake, she realized, but where\u2019s Riverrun? Then she saw. It\u2019s not so far\u2026\nThe afternoon was still young by the time she was done, so Arya took herself off to the godswood. Her duties were lighter as Lord Bolton\u2019s cupbearer than they had been under Weese or even Pinkeye, though they required dressing like a page and washing more than she liked. The hunt would not return for hours, so she had a little time for her needlework.\nShe slashed at birch leaves till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was green and sticky. \u201cSer Gregor,\u201d she breathed. \u201cDunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling.\u201d She spun and leapt and balanced on the balls of her feet, darting this way and that, knocking pinecones flying. \u201cThe Tickler,\u201d she called out one time, \u201cthe Hound,\u201d the next. \u201cSer Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.\u201d The bole of an oak loomed before her, and she lunged to drive her point through it, grunting \u201cJoffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey.\u201d Her arms and legs were dappled by sunlight and the shadows of leaves. A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time she paused. The heel of her right foot was bloody where she\u2019d skinned it, so she stood one-legged before the heart tree and raised her sword in salute. \u201cValar morghulis,\u201d she told the old gods of the north. She liked how the words sounded when she said them.\nAs Arya crossed the yard to the bathhouse, she spied a raven circling down toward the rookery, and wondered where it had come from and what message it carried. Might be it\u2019s from Robb, come to say it wasn\u2019t true about Bran and Rickon. She chewed on her lip, hoping. If I had wings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself. And if it was true, I\u2019d just fly away, fly up past the moon and the shining stars, and see all the things in Old Nan\u2019s stories, dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos, and maybe I wouldn\u2019t ever fly back unless I wanted to.\nThe hunting party returned near evenfall with nine dead wolves. Seven were adults, big grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful, their mouths drawn back over long yellow teeth by their dying snarls. But the other two had only been pups. Lord Bolton gave orders for the skins to be sewn into a blanket for his bed. \u201cCubs still have that soft fur, my lord,\u201d one of his men pointed out. \u201cMake you a nice warm pair of gloves.\u201d\nBolton glanced up at the banners waving above the gatehouse towers. \u201cAs the Starks are wont to remind us, winter is coming. Have it done.\u201d When he saw Arya looking on, he said, \u201cNan, I\u2019ll want a flagon of hot spice wine, I took a chill in the woods. See that it doesn\u2019t get cold. I\u2019m of a mind to sup alone. Barley bread, butter, and boar.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, my lord.\u201d That was always the best thing to say.\nHot Pie was making oatcakes when she entered the kitchen. Three other cooks were boning fish, while a spit boy turned a boar over the flames. \u201cMy lord wants his supper, and hot spice wine to wash it down,\u201d Arya announced, \u201cand he doesn\u2019t want it cold.\u201d One of the cooks washed his hands, took out a kettle, and filled it with a heavy, sweet red. Hot Pie was told to crumble in the spices as the wine heated. Arya went to help.\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to show me how to spice wine.\u201d\nHe hates me too, or else he\u2019s scared of me. She backed away, more sad than angry. When the food was ready, the cooks covered it with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick towel to keep it warm. Dusk was settling outside. On the walls the crows muttered round the heads like courtiers round a king. One of the guards held the door to Kingspyre. \u201cHope that\u2019s not weasel soup,\u201d he jested.\nRoose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leatherbound book when she entered. \u201cLight some candles,\u201d he commanded her as he turned a page. \u201cIt grows gloomy in here.\u201d\nShe placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her, filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves. Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger, then closed the book and placed it carefully in the fire. He watched the flames consume it, pale eyes shining with reflected light. The old dry leather went up with a whoosh, and the yellow pages stirred as they burned, as if some ghost were reading them. \u201cI will have no further need of you tonight,\u201d he said, never looking at her.\nShe should have gone, silent as a mouse, but something had hold of her. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she asked, \u201cwill you take me with you when you leave Harrenhal?\u201d\nHe turned to stare at her, and from the look in his eyes it was as if his supper had just spoken to him. \u201cDid I give you leave to question me, Nan?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d She lowered her eyes.\n\u201cYou should not have spoken, then. Should you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. My lord.\u201d\nFor a moment he looked amused. \u201cI will answer you, just this once. I mean to give Harrenhal to Lord Vargo when I return to the north. You will remain here, with him.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d she started.\nHe cut her off. \u201cI am not in the habit of being questioned by servants, Nan. Must I have your tongue out?\u201d\nHe would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog, she knew. \u201cNo, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll hear no more from you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cGo, then. I shall forget this insolence.\u201d\nArya went, but not to her bed. When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard, the guard on the door nodded at her and said, \u201cStorm coming. Smell the air?\u201d The wind was gusting, flames swirling off the torches mounted atop the walls beside the rows of heads. On her way to the godswood, she passed the Wailing Tower where once she had lived in fear of Weese. The Freys had taken it for their own since Harrenhal\u2019s fall. She could hear angry voices coming from a window, many men talking and arguing all at once. Elmar was sitting on the steps outside, alone.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks.\n\u201cMy princess,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dishonored, Aenys says. There was a bird from the Twins. My lord father says I\u2019ll need to marry someone else, or be a septon.\u201d\nA stupid princess, she thought, that\u2019s nothing to cry over. \u201cMy brothers might be dead,\u201d she confided.\nElmar gave her a scornful look. \u201cNo one cares about a serving girl\u2019s brothers.\u201d\nIt was hard not to hit him when he said that. \u201cI hope your princess dies,\u201d she said, and ran off before he could grab her. In the godswood she found her broomstick sword where she had left it, and carried it to the heart tree. There she knelt. Red leaves rustled. Red eyes peered inside her. The eyes of the gods. \u201cTell me what to do, you gods,\u201d she prayed.\nFor a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb. And then, far far off, beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf. Gooseprickles rose on Arya\u2019s skin, and for an instant she felt dizzy. Then, so faintly, it seemed as if she heard her father\u2019s voice. \u201cWhen the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut there is no pack,\u201d she whispered to the weirwood. Bran and Rickon were dead, the Lannisters had Sansa, Jon had gone to the Wall. \u201cI\u2019m not even me now, I\u2019m Nan.\u201d\n\u201cYou are Arya of Winterfell, daughter of the north. You told me you could be strong. You have the wolf blood in you.\u201d\n\u201cThe wolf blood.\u201d Arya remembered now. \u201cI\u2019ll be as strong as Robb. I said I would.\u201d She took a deep breath, then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across her knee. It broke with a loud crack, and she threw the pieces aside. I am a direwolf, and done with wooden teeth.\nThat night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw, listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise. They were the only voices she trusted anymore. She could hear the sound of her own breath, and the wolves as well, a great pack of them now. They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood, she thought. They are calling to me.\nFinally she slipped from under the blanket, wriggled into a tunic, and padded barefoot down the stairs. Roose Bolton was a cautious man, and the entrance to Kingspyre was guarded day and night, so she had to slip out of a narrow cellar window. The yard was still, the great castle lost in haunted dreams. Above, the wind keened through the Wailing Tower.\nAt the forge she found the fires extinguished and the doors closed and barred. She crept in a window, as she had once before. Gendry shared a mattress with two other apprentice smiths. She crouched in the loft for a long time before her eyes adjusted enough for her to be sure that he was the one on the end. Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched him. His eyes opened. He could not have been very deeply asleep. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. She took her hand off his mouth and pointed.\nFor a moment she did not think he understood, but then he slid out from under the blankets. Naked, he padded across the room, shrugged into a loose roughspun tunic, and climbed down from the loft after her. The other sleepers did not stir. \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d Gendry said in a low angry voice.\n\u201cA sword.\u201d\n\u201cBlackthumb keeps all the blades locked up, I told you that a hundred times. Is this for Lord Leech?\u201d\n\u201cFor me. Break the lock with your hammer.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll break my hand,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cOr worse.\u201d\n\u201cNot if you run off with me.\u201d\n\u201cRun, and they\u2019ll catch you and kill you.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do you worse. Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers, he told me so.\u201d\nGendry pushed black hair out of his eyes. \u201cSo?\u201d\nShe looked right at him, fearless. \u201cSo when Vargo Hoat\u2019s the lord, he\u2019s going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away. The smiths too.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only a story,\u201d he said scornfully.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true, I heard Lord Vargo say so,\u201d she lied. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cut one foot off everyone. The left one. Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie, he\u2019ll do what you say. We\u2019ll need bread or oatcakes or something. You get the swords and I\u2019ll do the horses. We\u2019ll meet near the postern in the east wall, behind the Tower of Ghosts. No one ever comes there.\u201d\n\u201cI know that gate. It\u2019s guarded, same as the rest.\u201d\n\u201cSo? You won\u2019t forget the swords?\u201d\n\u201cI never said I\u2019d come.\u201d\n\u201cNo. But if you do, you won\u2019t forget the swords?\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI guess I won\u2019t.\u201d\nArya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it, and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls. In her cell, she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully, in two layers of smallclothes, warm stockings, and her cleanest tunic. It was Lord Bolton\u2019s livery. On the breast was sewn his sigil, the flayed man of the Dreadfort. She tied her shoes, threw a wool cloak over her skinny shoulders, and knotted it under her throat. Quiet as a shadow, she moved back down the stairs. Outside the lord\u2019s solar she paused to listen at the door, easing it open slowly when she heard only silence.\nThe sheepskin map was on the table, beside the remains of Lord Bolton\u2019s supper. She rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt. He\u2019d left his dagger on the table as well, so she took that too, just in case Gendry lost his courage.\nA horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables. The grooms were all asleep. She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said, \u201cEh? Whas?\u201d\n\u201cLord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled.\u201d\nThe boy got to his feet, pushing straw from his hair. \u201cWha, at this hour? Horses, you say?\u201d He blinked at the sigil on her tunic. \u201cWhas he want horses for, in the dark?\u201d\n\u201cLord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants.\u201d She crossed her arms.\nThe stableboy was still looking at the flayed man. He knew what it meant. \u201cThree, you say?\u201d\n\u201cOne two three. Hunting horses. Fast and surefoot.\u201d Arya helped him with the bridles and saddles, so he would not need to wake any of the others. She hoped they would not hurt him afterward, but she knew they probably would.\nLeading the horses across the castle was the worst part. She stayed in the shadow of the curtain wall whenever she could, so the sentries walking their rounds on the ramparts above would have needed to look almost straight down to see her. And if they do, what of it? I\u2019m my lord\u2019s own cupbearer. It was a chill dank autumn night. Clouds were blowing in from the west, hiding the stars, and the Wailing Tower screamed mournfully at every gust of wind. It smells like rain. Arya did not know whether that would be good or bad for their escape.\nNo one saw her, and she saw no one, only a grey and white cat creeping along atop the godswood wall. It stopped and spit at her, waking memories of the Red Keep and her father and Syrio Forel. \u201cI could catch you if I wanted,\u201d she called to it softly, \u201cbut I have to go, cat.\u201d The cat hissed again and ran off.\nThe Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal\u2019s five immense towers. It stood dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for near three hundred years. It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come. It seemed as though she waited a long time. The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars. Arya took out the dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy. Long smooth strokes, the way Syrio had taught her. The sound calmed her.\nShe heard them coming long before she saw them. Hot Pie was breathing heavily, and once he stumbled in the dark, barked his shin, and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal. Gendry was quieter, but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved. \u201cHere I am.\u201d She stood. \u201cBe quiet or they\u2019ll hear you.\u201d\nThe boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones. Gendry was wearing oiled chainmail under his cloak, she saw, and he had his blacksmith\u2019s hammer slung across his back. Hot Pie\u2019s red round face peered out from under a hood. He had a sack of bread dangling from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a guard on that postern,\u201d said Gendry quietly. \u201cI told you there would be.\u201d\n\u201cYou stay here with the horses,\u201d said Arya. \u201cI\u2019ll get rid of him. Come quick when I call.\u201d\nGendry nodded. Hot Pie said, \u201cHoot like an owl when you want us to come.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not an owl,\u201d said Arya. \u201cI\u2019m a wolf. I\u2019ll howl.\u201d\nAlone, she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts. She walked fast, to keep ahead of her fear, and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her, and Yoren, and Jaqen H\u2019ghar, and Jon Snow. She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her, not yet. For this the dagger would be better. It was good and sharp. This postern was the least of Harrenhal\u2019s gates, a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails, set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower. Only one man was set to guard it, but she knew there would be sentries up in that tower as well, and others nearby walking the walls. Whatever happened, she must be quiet as a shadow. He must not call out. A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall. She felt one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose.\nShe made no effort to hide, but approached the guard openly, as if Lord Bolton himself had sent her. He watched her come, curious as to what might bring a page here at this black hour. When she got closer, she saw that he was a northman, very tall and thin, huddled in a ragged fur cloak. That was bad. She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions, but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life, and they knew him better than she did. If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside\u2026 No, she dare not. He was a northman, but not a Winterfell man. He belonged to Roose Bolton.\nWhen she reached him she pushed back her cloak so he would see the flayed man on her breast. \u201cLord Bolton sent me.\u201d\n\u201cAt this hour? Why for?\u201d\nShe could see the gleam of steel under the fur, and she did not know if she was strong enough to drive the point of the dagger through chainmail. His throat, it must be his throat, but he\u2019s too tall, I\u2019ll never reach it. For a moment she did not know what to say. For a moment she was a little girl again, and scared, and the rain on her face felt like tears.\n\u201cHe told me to give all his guards a silver piece, for their good service.\u201d The words seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\u201cSilver, you say?\u201d He did not believe her, but he wanted to; silver was silver, after all. \u201cGive it over, then.\u201d\nHer fingers dug down beneath her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given her. In the dark the iron could pass for tarnished silver. She held it out\u2026 and let it slip through her fingers.\nCursing her softly, the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was his neck right in front of her. Arya slid her dagger out and drew it across his throat, as smooth as summer silk. His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and he tried to shout but there was blood in his mouth as well.\n\u201cValar morghulis,\u201d she whispered as he died.\nWhen he stopped moving, she picked up the coin. Outside the walls of Harrenhal, a wolf howled long and loud. She lifted the bar, set it aside, and pulled open the heavy oak door. By the time Hot Pie and Gendry came up with the horses, the rain was falling hard. \u201cYou killed him!\u201d Hot Pie gasped.\n\u201cWhat did you think I would do?\u201d Her fingers were sticky with blood, and the smell was making her mare skittish. It\u2019s no matter, she thought, swinging up into the saddle. The rain will wash them clean again.",

      "content": "Sansa\nThe throne room was a sea of jewels, furs, and bright fabrics. Lords and ladies filled the back of the hall and stood beneath the high windows, jostling like fishwives on a dock.\nThe denizens of Joffrey\u2019s court had striven to outdo each other today. Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers, a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that he seemed like to take flight. The High Septon\u2019s crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved his head. At the council table, Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet, while beside her Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade. Moon Boy and Ser Dontos wore new suits of motley, clean as a spring morning. Even Lady Tanda and her daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair, and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace. King Joffrey sat above them all, amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne. He was in crimson samite, his black mantle studded with rubies, on his head his heavy golden crown.\nSquirming through a press of knights, squires, and rich townfolk, Sansa reached the front of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister.\nHe rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne. Sansa had never seen such armor; all burnished red steel, inlaid with golden scrollwork and ornamentation. His rondels were sunbursts, the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby eyes, and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it draped the hindquarters of his charger. Even the horse\u2019s armor was gilded, and his bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister.\nThe Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne. Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City. Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile.\nJoff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm, and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility, \u201cuntil Your Grace does come of age.\u201d Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand\u2019s chain of office around his neck. Lord Tywin took a seat at the council table beside the queen. After the destrier was led off and his homage removed, Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue.\nA fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great oaken doors. Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear, and the noble knights and highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight. Pride of place was given to Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden, a once-powerful man gone to fat, yet still handsome. His sons followed him in; Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant. The three dressed alike, in green velvet trimmed with sable.\nThe king descended the throne once more to greet them, a great honor. He fastened about the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold, from which hung a golden disc with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies. \u201cThe roses support the lion, as the might of Highgarden supports the realm,\u201d proclaimed Joffrey. \u201cIf there is any boon you would ask of me, ask and it shall be yours.\u201d\nAnd now it comes, thought Sansa.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Ser Loras, \u201cI beg the honor of serving in your Kingsguard, to defend you against your enemies.\u201d\nJoffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to his feet and kissed him on his cheek. \u201cDone, brother.\u201d\nLord Tyrell bowed his head. \u201cThere is no greater pleasure than to serve the King\u2019s Grace. If I was deemed worthy to join your royal council, you would find none more loyal or true.\u201d\nJoff put a hand on Lord Tyrell\u2019s shoulder and kissed him when he stood. \u201cYour wish is granted.\u201d\nSer Garlan Tyrell, five years senior to Ser Loras, was a taller bearded version of his more famous younger brother. He was thicker about the chest and broader at the shoulders, and though his face was comely enough, he lacked Ser Loras\u2019s startling beauty. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d Garlan said when the king approached him, \u201cI have a maiden sister, Margaery, the delight of our House. She was wed to Renly Baratheon, as you know, but Lord Renly went to war before the marriage could be consummated, so she remains innocent. Margaery has heard tales of your wisdom, courage, and chivalry, and has come to love you from afar. I beseech you to send for her, to take her hand in marriage, and to wed your House to mine for all time.\u201d\nKing Joffrey made a show of looking surprised. \u201cSer Garlan, your sister\u2019s beauty is famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word.\u201d\nQueen Cersei got to her feet in a rustle of skirts. \u201cYour Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now. Sire, your councillors beg you, for the good of your realm, set Sansa Stark aside. The Lady Margaery will make you a far more suitable queen.\u201d\nLike a pack of trained dogs, the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout their pleasure. \u201cMargaery,\u201d they called. \u201cGive us Margaery!\u201d and \u201cNo traitor queens! Tyrell! Tyrell!\u201d\nJoffrey raised a hand. \u201cI would like to heed the wishes of my people, Mother, but I took a holy vow.\u201d\nThe High Septon stepped forward. \u201cYour Grace, the gods hold bethrothal solemn, but your father, King Robert of blessed memory, made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed their falseness. Their crimes against the realm have freed you from any promise you might have made. So far as the Faith is concerned, there is no valid marriage contract \u2019twixt you and Sansa Stark.\u201d\nA tumult of cheering filled the throne room, and cries of \u201cMargaery, Margaery\u201d erupted all around her. Sansa leaned forward, her hands tight around the gallery\u2019s wooden rail. She knew what came next, but she was still frightened of what Joffrey might say, afraid that he would refuse to release her even now, when his whole kingdom depended upon it. She felt as if she were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor, waiting for her prince to grant her father mercy, and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off his head. Please, she prayed fervently, make him say it, make him say it.\nLord Tywin was looking at his grandson. Joff gave him a sullen glance, shifted his feet, and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise. \u201cThe gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. I will wed your sweet sister, and gladly, ser.\u201d He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers rose all around them.\nSansa felt curiously light-headed. I am free. She could feel eyes upon her. I must not smile, she reminded herself. The queen had warned her; no matter what she felt inside, the face she showed the world must look distraught. \u201cI will not have my son humiliated,\u201d Cersei said. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But if I\u2019m not to be queen, what will become of me?\u201d\n\u201cThat will need to be determined. For the moment, you shall remain here at court, as our ward.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go home.\u201d\nThe queen was irritated by that. \u201cYou should have learned by now, none of us get the things we want.\u201d\nI have, though, Sansa thought. I am free of Joffrey. I will not have to kiss him, nor give him my maidenhood, nor bear him children. Let Margaery Tyrell have all that, poor girl.\nBy the time the outburst died down, the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the council table, and his sons had joined the other knights and lordlings beneath the windows. Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were summoned forth to receive their rewards.\nPaxter Redwyne, Lord of the Arbor, marched down the length of the hall flanked by his twin sons Horror and Slobber, the former limping from a wound taken in the battle. After them followed Lord Mathis Rowan in a snowy doublet with a great tree worked upon the breast in gold thread; Lord Randyll Tarly, lean and balding, a greatsword across his back in a jeweled scabbard; Ser Kevan Lannister, a thickset balding man with a close-trimmed beard; Ser Addam Marbrand, coppery hair streaming to his shoulders; the great western lords Lydden, Crakehall, and Brax.\nNext came four of lesser birth who had distinguished themselves in the fighting: the one-eyed knight Ser Philip Foote, who had slain Lord Bryce Caron in single combat; the freerider Lothor Brune, who\u2019d cut his way through half a hundred Fossoway men-at-arms to capture Ser Jon of the green apple and kill Ser Bryan and Ser Edwyd of the red, thereby winning himself the name Lothor Apple-Eater; Willit, a grizzled man-atarms in the service of Ser Harys Swyft, who\u2019d pulled his master from beneath his dying horse and defended him against a dozen attackers; and a downy-cheeked squire named Josmyn Peckledon, who had killed two knights, wounded a third, and captured two more, though he could not have been more than fourteen. Willit was borne in on a litter, so grievous were his wounds.\nSer Kevan had taken a seat beside his brother Lord Tywin. When the heralds had finished telling of each hero\u2019s deeds, he rose. \u201cIt is His Grace\u2019s wish that these good men be rewarded for their valor. By his decree, Ser Philip shall henceforth be Lord Philip of House Foote, and to him shall go all the lands, rights, and incomes of House Caron. Lothor Brune to be raised to the estate of knighthood, and granted land and keep in the riverlands at war\u2019s end. To Josmyn Peckledon, a sword and suit of plate, his choice of any warhorse in the royal stables, and knighthood as soon as he shall come of age. And lastly, for Goodman Willit, a spear with a silver-banded haft, a hauberk of new-forged ringmail, and a full helm with visor. Further, the goodman\u2019s sons shall be taken into the service of House Lannister at Casterly Rock, the elder as a squire and the younger as a page, with the chance to advance to knighthood if they serve loyally and well. To all this, the King\u2019s Hand and the small council consent.\u201d\nThe captains of the king\u2019s warships Wildwind, Prince Aemon, and River Arrow were honored next, along with some under officers from Godsgrace, Lance, Lady of Silk, and Ramshead. As near as Sansa could tell, their chief accomplishment had been surviving the battle on the river, a feat that few enough could boast. Hallyne the Pyromancer and the masters of the Alchemists\u2019 Guild received the king\u2019s thanks as well, and Hallyne was raised to the style of lord, though Sansa noted that neither lands nor castle accompanied the title, which made the alchemist no more a true lord than Varys was. A more significant lordship by far was granted to Ser Lancel Lannister. Joffrey awarded him the lands, castle, and rights of House Darry, whose last child lord had perished during the fighting in the riverlands, \u201cleaving no trueborn heirs of lawful Darry blood, but only a bastard cousin.\u201d\nSer Lancel did not appear to accept the title; the talk was, his wound might cost him his arm or even his life. The Imp was said to be dying as well, from a terrible cut to the head.\nWhen the herald called, \u201cLord Petyr Baelish,\u201d he came forth dressed all in shades of rose and plum, his cloak patterned with mockingbirds. She could see him smiling as he knelt before the Iron Throne. He looks so pleased. Sansa had not heard of Littlefinger doing anything especially heroic during the battle, but it seemed he was to be rewarded all the same.\nSer Kevan got back to his feet. \u201cIt is the wish of the King\u2019s Grace that his loyal councillor Petyr Baelish be rewarded for faithful service to crown and realm. Be it known that Lord Baelish is granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, there to make his seat and rule henceforth as Lord Paramount of the Trident. Petyr Baelish and his sons and grandsons shall hold and enjoy these honors until the end of time, and all the lords of the Trident shall do him homage as their rightful liege. The King\u2019s Hand and the small council consent.\u201d\nOn his knees, Littlefinger raised his eyes to King Joffrey. \u201cI thank you humbly, Your Grace. I suppose this means I\u2019ll need to see about getting some sons and grandsons.\u201d\nJoffrey laughed, and the court with him. Lord Paramount of the Trident, Sansa thought, and Lord of Harrenhal as well. She did not understand why that should make him so happy; the honors were as empty as the title granted to Hallyne the Pyromancer. Harrenhal was cursed, everyone knew that, and the Lannisters did not even hold it at present. Besides, the lords of the Trident were sworn to Riverrun and House Tully, and to the King in the North; they would never accept Littlefinger as their liege. Unless they are made to. Unless my brother and my uncle and my grandfather are all cast down and killed. The thought made Sansa anxious, but she told herself she was being silly. Robb has beaten them every time. He\u2019ll beat Lord Baelish too, if he must.\nMore than six hundred new knights were made that day. They had held their vigil in the Great Sept of Baelor all through the night and crossed the city barefoot that morning to prove their humble hearts. Now they came forward dressed in shifts of undyed wool to receive their knighthoods from the Kingsguard. It took a long time, since only three of the Brothers of the White Sword were on hand to dub them. Mandon Moore had perished in the battle, the Hound had vanished, Aerys Oakheart was in Dorne with Princess Myrcella, and Jaime Lannister was Robb\u2019s captive, so the Kingsguard had been reduced to Balon Swann, Meryn Trant, and Osmund Kettleblack. Once knighted, each man rose, buckled on his swordbelt, and stood beneath the windows. Some had bloody feet from their walk through the city, but they stood tall and proud all the same, it seemed to Sansa.\nBy the time all the new knights had been given their sers the hall was growing restive, and none more so than Joffrey. Some of those in the gallery had begun to slip quietly away, but the notables on the floor were trapped, unable to depart without the king\u2019s leave. Judging by the way he was fidgeting atop the Iron Throne, Joff would willingly have granted it, but the day\u2019s work was far from done. For now the coin was turned over, and the captives were ushered in.\nThere were great lords and noble knights in that company too: sour old Lord Celtigar, the Red Crab; Ser Bonifer the Good; Lord Estermont, more ancient even than Celtigar; Lord Varner, who hobbled the length of the hall on a shattered knee, but would accept no help; Ser Mark Mullendore, grey-faced, his left arm gone to the elbow; fierce Red Ronnet of Griffin Roost; Ser Dermot of the Rainwood; Lord Willurn and his sons Josua and Elyas; Ser Jon Fossoway; Ser Timon the Scrapesword; Aurane, the bastard of Driftmark; Lord Staedmon, called Pennylover; hundreds of others.\nThose who had changed their allegiance during the battle needed only to swear fealty to Joffrey, but the ones who had fought for Stannis until the bitter end were compelled to speak. Their words decided their fate. If they begged forgiveness for their treasons and promised to serve loyally henceforth, Joffrey welcomed them back into the king\u2019s peace and restored them to all their lands and rights. A handful remained defiant, however. \u201cDo not imagine this is done, boy,\u201d warned one, the bastard son of some Florent or other. \u201cThe Lord of Light protects King Stannis, now and always. All your swords and all your scheming shall not save you when his hour comes.\u201d\n\u201cYour hour is come right now.\u201d Joffrey beckoned to Ser Ilyn Payne to take the man out and strike his head off. But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery heart on his surcoat shouted out, \u201cStannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an abomination born of incest!\u201d\n\u201cBe silent,\u201d Ser Kevan Lannister bellowed.\nThe knight raised his voice instead. \u201cJoffrey is the black worm eating the heart of the realm! Darkness was his father, and death his mother! Destroy him before he corrupts you all! Destroy them all, queen whore and king worm, vile dwarf and whispering spider, the false flowers. Save yourselves!\u201d One of the gold cloaks knocked the man off his feet, but he continued to shout. \u201cThe scouring fire will come! King Stannis will return! \u201c\nJoffrey lurched to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m king! Kill him! Kill him now! I command it.\u201d He chopped down with his hand, a furious, angry gesture\u2026 and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him. The bright crimson samite of his sleeve turned a darker shade of red as his blood soaked through it. \u201cMother!\u201d he wailed.\nWith every eye on the king, somehow the man on the floor wrested a spear away from one of the gold cloaks, and used it to push himself back to his feet. \u201cThe throne denies him!\u201d he cried. \u201cHe is no king!\u201d\nCersei was running toward the throne, but Lord Tywin remained still as stone. He had only to raise a finger, and Ser Meryn Trant moved forward with drawn sword. The end was quick and brutal. The gold cloaks seized the knight by the arms. \u201cNo king!\u201d he cried again as Ser Meryn drove the point of his longsword through his chest.\nJoff fell into his mother\u2019s arms. Three maesters came hurrying forward, to bundle him out through the king\u2019s door. Then everyone began talking at once. When the gold cloaks dragged off the dead man, he left a trail of bright blood across the stone floor. Lord Baelish stroked his beard while Varys whispered in his ear. Will they dismiss us now? Sansa wondered. A score of captives still waited, though whether to pledge fealty or shout curses, who could say?\nLord Tywin rose to his feet. \u201cWe continue,\u201d he said in a clear strong voice that silenced the murmurs. \u201cThose who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so. We will have no more follies.\u201d He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step, a mere three feet off the floor.\nThe light outside the windows was fading by the time the session drew to a close. Sansa felt limp with exhaustion as she made her way down from the gallery. She wondered how badly Joffrey had cut himself. They say the Iron Throne can be perilous cruel to those who were not meant to sit it.\nBack in the safety of her own chambers, she hugged a pillow to her face to muffle a squeal of joy. Oh, gods be good, he did it, he put me aside in front of everyone. When a serving girl brought her supper, she almost kissed her. There was hot bread and fresh-churned butter, a thick beef soup, capon and carrots, and peaches in honey. Even the food tastes sweeter, she thought.\nCome dark, she slipped into a cloak and left for the godswood. Ser Osmund Kettleblack was guarding the drawbridge in his white armor. Sansa tried her best to sound miserable as she bid him a good evening. From the way he leered at her, she was not sure she had been wholly convincing.\nDontos waited in the leafy moonlight. \u201cWhy so sadface?\u201d Sansa asked him gaily. \u201cYou were there, you heard. Joff put me aside, he\u2019s done with me, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nHe took her hand. \u201cOh, Jonquil, my poor Jonquil, you do not understand. Done with you? They\u2019ve scarcely begun.\u201d\nHer heart sank. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe queen will never let you go, never. You are too valuable a hostage. And Joffrey\u2026 sweetling, he is still king. If he wants you in his bed, he will have you, only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb instead of trueborn sons.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa said, shocked. \u201cHe let me go, he\u2026\u201d\nSer Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear. \u201cBe brave. I swore to see you home, and now I can. The day has been chosen.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa asked. \u201cWhen will we go?\u201d\n\u201cThe night of Joffrey\u2019s wedding. After the feast. All the necessary arrangements have been made. The Red Keep will be full of strangers. Half the court will be drunk and the other half will be helping Joffrey bed his bride. For a little while, you will be forgotten, and the confusion will be our friend.\u201d\n\u201cThe wedding won\u2019t be for a moon\u2019s turn yet. Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden, they\u2019ve only now sent for her.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve waited so long, be patient awhile longer. Here, I have something for you.\u201d Ser Dontos fumbled in his pouch and drew out a silvery spiderweb, dangling it between his thick fingers. It was a hair net of fine-spun silver, the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took it in her fingers. Small gems were set wherever two strands crossed, so dark they drank the moonlight. \u201cWhat stones are these?\u201d\n\u201cBlack amethysts from Asshai. The rarest kind, a deep true purple by daylight.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Sansa said, thinking, It is a ship I need, not a net for my hair.\n\u201cLovelier than you know, sweet child. It\u2019s magic, you see. It\u2019s justice you hold. It\u2019s vengeance for your father.\u201d Dontos leaned close and kissed her again. \u201cIt\u2019s home.\u201d",

      "content": "Theon\nMaester Luwin came to him when the first scouts were seen outside the walls. \u201cMy lord prince,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must yield.\u201d\nTheon stared at the platter of oakcakes, honey, and blood sausage they\u2019d brought him to break his fast. Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw, and the very sight of food sickened him. \u201cThere has been no reply from my uncle?\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d the maester said. \u201cNor from your father on Pyke.\u201d\n\u201cSend more birds.\u201d\n\u201cIt will not serve. By the time the birds reach\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSend them!\u201d Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm, he pushed off the blankets and rose from Ned Stark\u2019s bed naked and angry. \u201cOr do you want me dead? Is that it, Luwin? The truth now.\u201d\nThe small grey man was unafraid. \u201cMy order serves.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but whom?\u201d\n\u201cThe realm,\u201d Maester Luwin said, \u201cand Winterfell. Theon, once I taught you sums and letters, history and warcraft. And might have taught you more, had you wished to learn. I will not claim to bear you any great love, no, but I cannot hate you either. Even if I did, so long as you hold Winterfell I am bound by oath to give you counsel. So now I counsel you to yield.\u201d\nTheon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor, shook off the rushes, and draped it over his shoulders. A fire, I\u2019ll have a fire, and clean garb. Where\u2019s Wex? I\u2019ll not go to my grave in dirty clothes.\n\u201cYou have no hope of holding here,\u201d the maester went on. \u201cIf your lord father meant to send you aid, he would have done so by now. It is the Neck that concerns him. The battle for the north will be fought amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so,\u201d said Theon. \u201cAnd so long as I hold Winterfell, Ser Rodrik and Stark\u2019s lords bannermen cannot march south to take my uncle in the rear.\u201d I am not so innocent of warcraft as you think, old man. \u201cI have food enough to stand a year\u2019s siege, if need be.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be no siege. Perhaps they will spend a day or two fashioning ladders and tying grapnels to the ends of ropes. But soon enough they will come over your walls in a hundred places at once. You may be able to hold the keep for a time, but the castle will fall within the hour. You would do better to open your gates and ask for\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014mercy? I know what kind of mercy they have for me.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a way.\u201d\n\u201cI am ironborn,\u201d Theon reminded him. \u201cI have my own way. What choice have they left me? No, don\u2019t answer, I\u2019ve heard enough of your counsel. Go and send those birds as I commanded, and tell Lorren I want to see him. And Wex as well. I\u2019ll have my mail scoured clean, and my garrison assembled in the yard.\u201d\nFor a moment he thought the maester was going to defy him. But finally Luwin bowed stiffly. \u201cAs you command.\u201d\nThey made a pitifully small assembly; the ironmen were few, the yard large. \u201cThe northmen will be on us before nightfall,\u201d he told them. \u201cSer Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call. I will not run from them. I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell. But I will not command any man to die with me. If you leave now, before Ser Rodrik\u2019s main force is upon us, there\u2019s still a chance you may win free.\u201d He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt. \u201cThose who would stay and fight, step forward.\u201d\nNo one spoke. The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if they were made of stone. A few exchanged looks. Urzen shuffled his feet. Dykk Harlaw hawked and spat. A finger of wind ruffled Endehar\u2019s long fair hair.\nTheon felt as though he were drowning. Why am I surprised? he thought bleakly. His father had forsaken him, his uncles, his sister, even that wretched creature Reek. Why should his men prove any more loyal? There was nothing to say, nothing to do. He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky, sword in hand, waiting, waiting\u2026\nWex was the first to cross the line. Three quick steps and he stood at Theon\u2019s side, slouching. Shamed by the boy, Black Lorren followed, all scowls. \u201cWho else?\u201d he demanded. Red Rolfe came forward. Kromm. Werlag. Tymor and his brothers. Ulf the Ill. Harrag Sheepstealer. Four Harlaws and two Botleys. Kenned the Whale was the last. Seventeen in all.\nUrzen was among those who did not move, and Stygg, and every man of the ten that Asha had brought from Deepwood Motte. \u201cGo, then,\u201d Theon told them. \u201cRun to my sister. She\u2019ll give you all a warm welcome, I have no doubt.\u201d\nStygg had the grace at least to look ashamed. The rest moved off without a word. Theon turned to the seventeen who remained. \u201cBack to the walls. If the gods should spare us, I shall remember every man of you.\u201d\nBlack Lorren stayed when the others had gone. \u201cThe castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. What would you have me do?\u201d\n\u201cPut them out,\u201d said Lorren. \u201cEvery one.\u201d\nTheon shook his head. \u201cIs the noose ready?\u201d\n\u201cIt is. You mean to use it?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know a better way?\u201d\n\u201cAye. I\u2019ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge, and let them come try me. One at a time, two, three, it makes no matter. None will pass the moat while I still draw breath.\u201d\nHe means to die, thought Theon. It\u2019s not victory he wants, it\u2019s an end worthy of a song. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the noose.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say,\u201d Lorren replied, contempt in his eyes.\nWex helped garb him for battle. Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail, and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather. Once armed and armored, Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom. The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle. It was hard to judge their numbers. A thousand at least; perhaps twice that many. Against seventeen. They\u2019d brought catapults and scorpions. He saw no siege towers rumbling up the kingsroad, but there was timber enough in the wolfswood to build as many as were required.\nTheon studied their banners through Maester Luwin\u2019s Myrish lens tube. The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever he looked, and there were Tallhart trees as well, and mermen from White Harbor. Less common were the sigils of Flint and Karstark. Here and there he even saw the bull moose of the Hornwoods. But no Glovers, Asha saw to them, no Boltons from the Dreadfort, no Umbers come down from the shadow of the Wall. Not that they were needed. Soon enough the boy Cley Cerwyn appeared before the gates carrying a peace banner on a tall staff, to announce that Ser Rodrik Cassel wished to parley with Theon Turncloak.\nTurncloak. The name was bitter as bile. He had gone to Pyke to lead his father\u2019s longships against Lannisport, he remembered. \u201cI shall be out shortly,\u201d he shouted down. \u201cAlone.\u201d\nBlack Lorren disapproved. \u201cOnly blood can wash out blood,\u201d he declared. \u201cKnights may keep their truces with other knights, but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing with those they deem outlaw.\u201d\nTheon bristled. \u201cI am the Prince of Winterfell and heir to the Iron Islands. Now go find the girl and do as I told you.\u201d\nBlack Lorren gave him a murderous look. \u201cAye, Prince.\u201d\nHe\u2019s turned against me too, Theon realized. Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones of Winterfell had turned against him. If I die, I die friendless and abandoned. What choice did that leave him, but to live?\nHe rode to the gatehouse with his crown on his head. A woman was drawing water from the well, and Gage the cook stood in the door of the kitchens. They hid their hatred behind sullen looks and faces blank as slate, yet he could feel it all the same.\nWhen the drawbridge was lowered, a chill wind sighed across the moat. The touch of it made him shiver. It is the cold, nothing more, Theon told himself, a shiver, not a tremble. Even brave men shiver. Into the teeth of that wind he rode, under the portcullis, over the drawbridge. The outer gates swung open to let him pass. As he emerged beneath the walls, he could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been.\nSer Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding. Beside him, the direwolf of Stark flapped from a staff borne by young Cley Cerwyn. They were alone in the square, though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses, spearmen to his right, and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly. Every one of them wants me dead. Some were boys he\u2019d drunk with, diced with, even wenched with, but that would not save him if he fell into their hands.\n\u201cSer Rodrik.\u201d Theon reined to a halt. \u201cIt grieves me that we must meet as foes.\u201d\n\u201cMy own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you.\u201d The old knight spat onto the muddy ground. \u201cTheon Turncloak.\u201d\n\u201cI am a Greyjoy of Pyke,\u201d Theon reminded him. \u201cThe cloak my father swaddled me in bore a kraken, not a direwolf.\u201d\n\u201cFor ten years you have been a ward of Stark.\u201d\n\u201cHostage and prisoner, I call it.\u201d\n\u201cThen perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall. Instead he raised you among his own sons, the sweet boys you have butchered, and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war. Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead of placing one in your hand.\u201d\n\u201cI came out to parley, not to suffer your insults. Say what you have to say, old man. What would you have of me?\u201d\n\u201cTwo things,\u201d the old man said. \u201cWinterfell, and your life. Command your men to open the gates and lay down their arms. Those who murdered no children shall be free to walk away, but you shall be held for King Robb\u2019s justice. May the gods take pity on you when he returns.\u201d\n\u201cRobb will never look on Winterfell again,\u201d Theon promised. \u201cHe will break himself on Moat Cailin, as every southron army has done for ten thousand years. We hold the north now, ser.\u201d\n\u201cYou hold three castles,\u201d replied Ser Rodrik, \u201cand this one I mean to take back, Turncloak.\u201d\nTheon ignored that. \u201cHere are my terms. You have until evenfall to disperse. Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be confirmed in their rights and properties and suffer no harm. Those who defy us will be destroyed.\u201d\nYoung Cerwyn was incredulous. \u201cAre you mad, Greyjoy?\u201d\nSer Rodrik shook his head. \u201cOnly vain, lad. Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of himself, I fear.\u201d The old man jabbed a finger at him. \u201cDo not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight his way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you. I have near two thousand men with me\u2026 and if the tales be true, you have no more than fifty.\u201d\nSeventeen, in truth. Theon made himself smile. \u201cI have something better than men.\u201d And he raised a fist over his head, the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for.\nThe walls of Winterfell were behind him, but Ser Rodrik faced them squarely and could not fail to see. Theon watched his face. When his chin quivered under those stiff white whiskers, he knew just what the old man was seeing. He is not surprised, he thought with sadness, but the fear is there.\n\u201cThis is craven,\u201d Ser Rodrik said. \u201cTo use a child so\u2026 this is despicable.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d said Theon. \u201cIt\u2019s a dish I tasted myself, or have you forgotten? I was ten when I was taken from my father\u2019s house, to make certain he would raise no more rebellions.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the same!\u201d\nTheon\u2019s face was impassive. \u201cThe noose I wore was not made of hempen rope, that\u2019s true enough, but I felt it all the same. And it chafed, Ser Rodrik. It chafed me raw.\u201d He had never quite realized that until now, but as the words came spilling out he saw the truth of them.\n\u201cNo harm was ever done you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no harm will be done your Beth, so long as you\u2014\u201d\nSer Rodrik never gave him the chance to finish. \u201cViper,\u201d the knight declared, his face red with rage beneath those white whiskers. \u201cI gave you the chance to save your men and die with some small shred of honor, Turncloak. I should have known that was too much to ask of a childkiller.\u201d His hand went to the hilt of his sword. \u201cI ought cut you down here and now and put an end to your lies and deceits. By the gods, I should.\u201d\nTheon did not fear a doddering old man, but those watching archers and that line of knights were a different matter. If the swords came out his chances of getting back to the castle alive were small to none. \u201cForswear your oath and murder me, and you will watch your little Beth strangle at the end of a rope.\u201d\nSer Rodrik\u2019s knuckles had gone white, but after a moment he took his hand off the swordhilt. \u201cTruly, I have lived too long.\u201d\n\u201cI will not disagree, ser. Will you accept my terms?\u201d\n\u201cI have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your own House? Beth is the last of your blood.\u201d\nThe old knight drew himself up straight. \u201cI offer myself in my daughter\u2019s place. Release her, and take me as your hostage. Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a child.\u201d\n\u201cNot to me.\u201d A valiant gesture, old man, but I am not that great a fool. \u201cNot to Lord Manderly or Leobald Tallhart either, I\u2019d wager.\u201d Your sorry old skin is worth no more to them than any other man\u2019s. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll keep the girl\u2026 and keep her safe, so long as you do as I\u2019ve commanded you. Her life is in your hands.\u201d\n\u201cGods be good, Theon, how can you do this? You know I must attack, have sworn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets, Beth will hang,\u201d said Theon. \u201cAnother hostage will follow her to the grave at first light, and another at sunset. Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death, until you are gone. I have no lack of hostages.\u201d He did not wait for a reply, but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle. He went slowly at first, but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter. The small heads watched him come from their spikes, their tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard; between them stood little Beth Cassel, noosed and crying. Theon put his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop. Smiler\u2019s hooves clattered on the drawbridge, like drumbeats.\nIn the yard he dismounted and handed his reins to Wex. \u201cIt may stay them,\u201d he told Black Lorren. \u201cWe\u2019ll know by sunset. Take the girl in till then, and keep her somewhere safe.\u201d Under the layers of leather, steel, and wool, he was slick with sweat. \u201cI need a cup of wine. A vat of wine would do even better.\u201d\nA fire had been laid in Ned Stark\u2019s bedchamber. Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults, a wine as sour as his mood. They will attack, he thought gloomily, staring at the flames. Ser Rodrik loves his daughter, but he is still castellan, and most of all a knight. Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without, the warhorns would already have sounded the attack, he had no doubt. He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn. The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff, though he was not certain they would prove soft enough.\nIf not, if the old man gave the command to storm the castle regardless, Winterfell would fall; Theon entertained no delusions on that count. His seventeen might kill three, four, five times their own number, but in the end they would be overwhelmed.\nTheon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet, brooding on the injustice of it all. \u201cI rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood,\u201d he muttered. He had been frightened that night, but not like this. It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends, and another to perish alone and despised. Mercy, he thought miserably.\nWhen the wine brought no solace, Theon sent Wex to fetch his bow and took himself to the old inner ward. There he stood, loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody, pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round. I saved Bran\u2019s life with this bow, he reminded himself. Would that I could save my own. Women came to the well, but did not linger; whatever they saw on Theon\u2019s face sent them away quickly.\nBehind him the broken tower stood, its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago. As the sun moved, the shadow of the tower moved as well, gradually lengthening, a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy. By the time the sun touched the wall, he was in its grasp. If I hang the girl, the northmen will attack at once, he thought as he loosed a shaft. If I do not hang her, they will know my threats are empty. He knocked another arrow to his bow. There is no way out, none.\n\u201cIf you had a hundred archers as good as yourself, you might have a chance to hold the castle,\u201d a voice said softly.\nWhen he turned, Maester Luwin was behind him. \u201cGo away,\u201d Theon told him. \u201cI have had enough of your counsel.\u201d\n\u201cAnd life? Have you had enough of that, my lord prince?\u201d\nHe raised the bow. \u201cOne more word and I\u2019ll put this shaft through your heart.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\nTheon bent the bow, drawing the grey goose feathers back to his cheek. \u201cCare to make a wager?\u201d\n\u201cI am your last hope, Theon.\u201d\nI have no hope, he thought. Yet he lowered the bow half an inch and said, \u201cI will not run.\u201d\n\u201cI do not speak of running. Take the black.\u201d\n\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch?\u201d Theon let the bow unbend slowly and pointed the arrow at the ground.\n\u201cSer Rodrik has served House Stark all his life, and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch. He will not deny you. Open your gates, lay down your arms, accept his terms, and he must let you take the black.\u201d\nA brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. It meant no crown, no sons, no wife\u2026 but it meant life, and life with honor. Ned Stark\u2019s own brother had chosen the Watch, and Jon Snow as well.\nI have black garb aplenty, once I tear the krakens off. Even my horse is black. I could rise high in the Watch\u2014chief of rangers, likely even Lord Commander. Let Asha keep the bloody islands, they\u2019re as dreary as she is. If I served at Eastwatch, I could command my own ship, and there\u2019s fine hunting beyond the Wall. As for women, what wildling woman wouldn\u2019t want a prince in her bed? A slow smile crept across his face, A black cloak can\u2019t be turned. I\u2019d be as good as any man\u2026\n\u201cPRINCE THEON!\u201d The sudden shout shattered his daydream. Kromm was loping across the ward. \u201cThe northmen\u2014\u201d\nHe felt a sudden sick sense of dread. \u201cIs it the attack?\u201d\nMaester Luwin clutched his arm. \u201cThere\u2019s still time. Raise a peace banner\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re fighting,\u201d Kromm said urgently. \u201cMore men came up, hundreds of them, and at first they made to join the others. But now they\u2019ve fallen on them!\u201d\n\u201cIs it Asha?\u201d Had she come to save him after all?\nBut Kromm gave a shake of his head. \u201cNo. These are northmen, I tell you. With a bloody man on their banner.\u201d\nThe flayed man of the Dreadfort. Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before his capture, Theon recalled. It was hard to believe that a vile creature like him could sway the Boltons to change their allegiance, but nothing else made sense. \u201cI\u2019ll see this for myself,\u201d Theon said.\nMaester Luwin trailed after him. By the time they reached the battlements, dead men and dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates. He saw no battle lines, only a swirling chaos of banners and blades. Shouts and screams rang through the cold autumn air. Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers, but the Dreadfort men were better led, and had taken the others unawares. Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again, chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the houses. He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified trumpeting of a maimed horse. The inn was burning, he saw.\nBlack Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time. The sun was low in the west, painting the fields and houses all a glowing red. A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over the walls, and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses. Theon watched a wounded man drag himself painfully across the ground, smearing his life\u2019s blood in the dirt as he struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square. He died before he got there. He wore a leather jerkin and conical halfhelm, but no badge to tell which side he\u2019d fought on.\nThe crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. \u201cThe Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,\u201d Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.\n\u201cDothraki?\u201d\n\u201cThe horselords across the narrow sea.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Them.\u201d Black Lorren frowned through his beard. \u201cSavages believe all manner of foolish things.\u201d\nAs the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below, but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing, and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing. Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke. At their head was a knight in dark armor. His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red, and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders. Outside the main gate he reined up, and one of his men shouted for the castle to open.\n\u201cAre you friend or foe?\u201d Black Lorren bellowed down.\n\u201cWould a foe bring such fine gifts?\u201d Red Helm waved a hand, and three corpses were dumped in front of the gates. A torch was waved above the bodies, so the defenders upon the walls might see the faces of the dead.\n\u201cThe old castellan,\u201d said Black Lorren.\n\u201cWith Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn.\u201d The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye, and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow. Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay, turned away from the battlements, and fell to his knees sick.\n\u201cThe great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor, or we would have brought him as well,\u201d shouted Red Helm.\nI am saved, Theon thought. So why did he feel so empty? This was victory, sweet victory, the deliverance he had prayed for. He glanced at Maester Luwin. To think how close I came to yielding, and taking the black\u2026\n\u201cOpen the gates for our friends.\u201d Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what his dreams might bring.\nThe Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates. Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard. Pale red pennons trailed from the ends of a few lances, but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters. \u201cHow many men did you lose?\u201d Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted.\n\u201cTwenty or thirty.\u201d The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor. His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man\u2019s face and shoulders, skinless and bloody, mouth open in a silent howl of anguish.\n\u201cSer Rodrik had you five-to-one.\u201d\n\u201cAye, but he thought us friends. A common mistake. When the old fool gave me his hand, I took half his arm instead. Then I let him see my face.\u201d The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head, holding it in the crook of his arm.\n\u201cReek,\u201d Theon said, disquieted. How did a serving man get such fine armor?\nThe man laughed. \u201cThe wretch is dead.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cThe girl\u2019s fault. If she had not run so far, his horse would not have lamed, and we might have been able to flee. I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge. I was done with her by then, and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm. I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands\u2014calfskin boots and velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, even my sable cloak. Ride for the Dreadfort, I told him, bring all the help you can. Take my horse, he\u2019s swifter, and here, wear the ring my father gave me, so they\u2019ll know you came from me. He\u2019d learned better than to question me. By the time they put that arrow through his back, I\u2019d smeared myself with the girl\u2019s filth and dressed in his rags. They might have hanged me anyway, but it was the only chance I saw.\u201d He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cAnd now, my sweet prince, there was a woman promised me, if I brought two hundred men. Well, I brought three times as many, and no green boys nor fieldhands neither, but my father\u2019s own garrison.\u201d\nTheon had given his word. This was not the time to flinch. Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later. \u201cHarrag,\u201d he said, \u201cgo to the kennels and bring Palla out for\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cRamsay.\u201d There was a smile on his plump lips, but none in those pale pale eyes. \u201cSnow, my wife called me before she ate her fingers, but I say Bolton.\u201d His smile curdled. \u201cSo you\u2019d offer me a kennel girl for my good service, is that the way of it?\u201d\nThere was a tone in his voice Theon did not like, no more than he liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at him. \u201cShe was what was promised.\u201d\n\u201cShe smells of dogshit. I\u2019ve had enough of bad smells, as it happens. I think I\u2019ll have your bedwarmer instead. What do you call her? Kyra?\u201d\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d Theon said angrily. \u201cI\u2019ll have you\u2014\u201d\nThe Bastard\u2019s backhand caught him square, and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel. The world vanished in a red roar of pain.\nSometime later, Theon found himself on the ground. He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood. Close the gates! he tried to shout, but it was too late. The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned, and more were pouring through, a river of mail and sharp swords. There was a ringing in his ears, and horror all around him. Black Lorren had his sword out, but there were already four of them pressing in on him. He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall. Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders, then swung back to ride over him. Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.\u201d\nThe last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing\u2026",

      "content": "Tyrion\nHe dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh. The air was full of acrid smoke. Men were groaning and whimpering all around him, and from time to time a scream would pierce the air, thick with pain. When he tried to move, he found that he had fouled his own bedding. The smoke in the air made his eyes water. Am I crying? He must not let his father see. He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock. A lion, I must be a lion, live a lion, die a lion. He hurt so much, though. Too weak to groan, he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes. Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy, monotonous voice. He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying. After a time the room faded.\nHe found himself outside the city, walking through a world without color. Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings, while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps. White maggots burrowed through black corruption. The wolves were grey, and so were the silent sisters; together they stripped the flesh from the fallen. There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields. The sun was a hot white penny, shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships. From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes. My work, thought Tyrion Lannister. They died at my command.\nAt first there was no sound in the world, but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead, soft and terrible. They wept and moaned, they begged for an end to pain, they cried for help and wanted their mothers. Tyrion had never known his mother. He wanted Shae, but she was not there. He walked alone amidst grey shadows, trying to remember\u2026\nThe silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes. All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain; they were garbed in shades of white and grey, and their blood was black and crusty. He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg, to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows. Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon, pulled by two tall black horses.\nSo many dead, so very many. Their corpses hung limply, their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas, unrecognizable, hardly human. The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts, grey lions, dead flowers, and pale ghostly stags. Their armor was all dented and gashed, the chainmail riven, broken, slashed. Why did I kill them all? He had known once, but somehow he had forgotten.\nHe would have asked one of the silent sisters, but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth. Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth. The discovery terrified him. How could he live without a mouth? He began to run. The city was not far. He would be safe inside the city, away from all these dead. He did not belong with the dead. He had no mouth, but he was still a living man. No, a lion, a lion, and alive. But when he reached the city walls, the gates were shut against him.\nIt was dark when he woke again. At first he could see nothing, but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him. The drapes were drawn, but he could see the shape of carved bedposts, and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head. Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed, and the pillow beneath his head was goose down. My own bed, I am in my own bed, in my own bedchamber.\nIt was warm inside the drapes, under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him. He was sweating. Fever, he thought groggily. He felt so weak, and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand. He gave up the effort. His head felt enormous, as big as the bed, too heavy to raise from the pillow. His body he could scarcely feel at all. How did I come here? He tried to remember. The battle came back in fits and flashes. The fight along the river, the knight who\u2019d offered up his gauntlet, the bridge of ships\u2026\nSer Mandon. He saw the dead empty eyes, the reaching hand, the green fire shining against the white enamel plate. Fear swept over him in a cold rush; beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go. He would have cried out, if he\u2019d had a mouth. No, that was the dream, he thought, his head pounding. Help me, someone help me. Jaime, Shae, Mother, someone\u2026 Tysha\u2026\nNo one heard. No one came. Alone in the dark, he fell back into piss-scented sleep. He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed, with their lord father beside her, frowning. It had to be a dream, since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away, fighting Robb Stark in the west. Others came and went as well. Varys looked down on him and sighed, but Littlefinger made a quip. Bloody treacherous bastard, Tyrion thought venomously, we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back. Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another, but he did not understand the words. Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt.\nHe wanted to ask if they\u2019d won the battle. We must have, else I\u2019d be a head on a spike somewhere. If I live, we won. He did not know what pleased him more: the victory, or the fact he had been able to reason it out. His wits were coming back to him, however slowly. That was good. His wits were all he had.\nThe next time he woke, the draperies had been pulled back, and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle. When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off. No, don\u2019t go, help me, help, he tried to call, but the best he could do was a muffled moan. I have no mouth. He raised a hand to his face, his every movement pained and fumbling. His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh, lips, teeth. Linen. The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly, a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding.\nA short while later Pod reappeared. This time a stranger was with him, a maester chained and robed. \u201cMy lord, you must be still,\u201d the man murmured. \u201cYou are grievous hurt. You will do yourself great injury. Are you thirsty?\u201d\nHe managed an awkward nod. The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat. Tyrion swallowed, scarcely tasting. Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy. By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth, he was already spiraling back to sleep.\nThis time he dreamed he was at a feast, a victory feast in some great hall. He had a high seat on the dais, and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero. Marillion was there, the singer who\u2019d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon. He played his woodharp and sang of the Imp\u2019s daring deeds. Even his father was smiling with approval. When the song was over, Jaime rose from his place, commanded Tyrion to kneel, and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword, and he rose up a knight. Shae was waiting to embrace him. She took him by the hand, laughing and teasing, calling him her giant of Lannister.\nHe woke in darkness to a cold empty room. The draperies had been drawn again. Something felt wrong, turned around, though he could not have said what. He was alone once more. Pushing back the blankets, he tried to sit, but the pain was too much and he soon subsided, breathing raggedly. His face was the least part of it. His right side was one huge ache, and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm. What\u2019s happened to me? Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it. I was hurt more badly than I knew. Ser Mandon\u2026\nThe memory frightened him, but Tyrion made himself hold it, turn it in his head, stare at it hard. He tried to kill me, no mistake. That part was not a dream. He would have cut me in half if Pod had not\u2026 Pod, where\u2019s Pod?\nGritting his teeth, he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked. The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down, half on the rushes and half on him. Even that small effort had dizzied him. The room whirled around him, all bare walls and dark shadows, with a single narrow window. He saw a chest he\u2019d owned, an untidy pile of his clothing, his battered armor. This is not my bedchamber, he realized. Not even the Tower of the Hand. Someone had moved him. His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan. They have moved me here to die, he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more. The room was dank and cold, and he was burning.\nHe dreamed of a better place, a snug little cottage by the sunset sea. The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth, but he had always been warm there, even when they let the fire go out. She used to tease me about that, he remembered. I never thought to feed the fire, that had always been a servant\u2019s task. \u201cWe have no servants,\u201d she would remind me, and I would say, \u201cYou have me, I\u2019m your servant,\u201d and she would say, \u201cA lazy servant. What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock, my lord?\u201d and he would tell her, \u201cThey kiss them.\u201d That would always make her giggle. \u201cThey do not neither. They beat them, I bet,\u201d she would say, but he would insist, \u201cNo, they kiss them, just like this.\u201d He would show her how. \u201cThey kiss their fingers first, every one, and they kiss their wrists, yes, and inside their elbows. Then they kiss their funny ears, all our servants have funny ears. Stop laughing! And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them, there, so, like that, and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips, their\u2026 mmmm\u2026 mouths\u2026 so\u2026\u201d\nThey would kiss for hours, and spend whole days doing no more than lolling in bed, listening to the waves, and touching each other. Her body was a wonder to him, and she seemed to find delight in his. Sometimes she would sing to him. I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in her hair. \u201cI love you, Tyrion,\u201d she would whisper before they went to sleep at night. \u201cI love your lips. I love your voice, and the words you say to me, and how you treat me gentle. I love your face.\u201d\n\u201cMy face?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes. I love your hands, and how you touch me. Your cock, I love your cock, I love how it feels when it\u2019s in me.\u201d\n\u201cIt loves you too, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cI love to say your name. Tyrion Lannister. It goes with mine. Not the Lannister, t\u2019other part. Tyrion and Tysha. Tysha and Tyrion. Tyrion. My lord Tyrion\u2026\u201d\nLies, he thought, all feigned, all for gold, she was a whore, Jaime\u2019s whore, Jaime\u2019s gift, my lady of the lie. Her face seemed to fade away, dissolving behind a veil of tears, but even after she was gone he could still hear the faint, far-off sound of her voice, calling his name. \u201c\u2026my lord, can you hear me? My lord? Tyrion? My lord? My lord?\u201d\nThrough a haze of poppied sleep, he saw a soft pink face leaning over him. He was back in the dank room with the torn bed hangings, and the face was wrong, not hers, too round, with a brown fringe of beard. \u201cDo you thirst, my lord? I have your milk, your good milk. You must not fight, no, don\u2019t try to move, you need your rest.\u201d He had the copper funnel in one damp pink hand and a flask in the other.\nAs the man leaned close, Tyrion\u2019s fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals, grabbed, pulled. The maester dropped the flask, spilling milk of the poppy all over the blanket. Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man\u2019s fat neck. \u201cNo. More,\u201d he croaked, so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken. But he must have, for the maester choked out a reply. \u201cUnhand, please, my lord\u2026 need your milk, the pain\u2026 the chain, don\u2019t, unhand, no\u2026\u201d\nThe pink face was beginning to purple when Tyrion let go. The maester reeled back, sucking in air. His reddened throat showed deep white gouges where the links had pressed. His eyes were white too. Tyrion raised a hand to his face and made a ripping motion over the hardened mask. And again. And again.\n\u201cYou\u2026 you want the bandages off, is that it?\u201d the maester said at last. \u201cBut I\u2019m not to\u2026 that would be\u2026 be most unwise, my lord. You are not yet healed, the queen would\u2026\u201d\nThe mention of his sister made Tyrion growl. Are you one of hers, then? He pointed a finger at the maester, then coiled his hand into a fist. Crushing, choking, a promise, unless the fool did as he was bid.\nThankfully, he understood. \u201cI\u2026 I will do as my lord commands, to be sure, but\u2026 this is unwise, your wounds\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo. It.\u201d Louder that time.\nBowing, the man left the room, only to return a few moments later, bearing a long knife with a slender sawtooth blade, a basin of water, a pile of soft cloths, and several flasks. By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches, so he was half sitting against his pillow. The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin, beneath the mask. A slip of the hand here, and Cersei will be free of me, he thought. He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen, only inches above his throat.\nFortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister\u2019s braver creatures. After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks. There was pain as well, but he did his best to ignore that. The maester discarded the bandages, still crusty with potion. \u201cBe still now, I must wash out the wound.\u201d His touch was gentle, the water warm and soothing. The wound, Tyrion thought, remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes. \u201cThis is like to sting some,\u201d the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs. It did more than sting. It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion\u2019s face, and twisted a burning poker up his nose. His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath, but somehow he managed not to scream. The maester was clucking like an old hen. \u201cIt would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit, my lord. Still, it looks clean, good, good. When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying, your wounds were filthy. One of your ribs was broken, doubtless you can feel it, the blow of some mace perhaps, or a fall, it\u2019s hard to say. And you took an arrow in the arm, there where it joins the shoulder. It showed signs of mortification, and for a time I feared you might lose the limb, but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots, and now it seems to be healing clean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cName,\u201d Tyrion breathed up at him. \u201cName.\u201d\nThe maester blinked. \u201cWhy, you are Tyrion Lannister, my lord. Brother to the queen. Do you remember the battle? Sometimes with head wounds\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour name.\u201d His throat was raw, and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words.\n\u201cI am Maester Ballabar.\u201d\n\u201cBallabar,\u201d Tyrion repeated. \u201cBring me. Looking glass.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d the maester said, \u201cI would not counsel\u2026 that might be, ah, unwise, as it were\u2026 your wound\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBring it,\u201d he had to say. His mouth was stiff and sore, as if a punch had split his lip. \u201cAnd drink. Wine. No poppy.\u201d\nThe maester rose flush-faced and hurried off. He came back with a flagon of pale amber wine and a small silvered looking glass in an ornate golden frame. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he poured half a cup of wine and held it to Tyrion\u2019s swollen lips. The trickle went down cool, though he could hardly taste it. \u201cMore,\u201d he said when the cup was empty. Maester Ballabar poured again. By the end of the second cup, Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to face his face.\nHe turned over the glass, and did not know whether he ought to laugh or cry. The gash was long and crooked, starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw. Three-quarters of his nose was gone, and a chunk of his lip. Someone had sewn the torn flesh together with catgut, and their clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw, red, half-healed flesh. \u201cPretty,\u201d he croaked, flinging the glass aside.\nHe remembered now. The bridge of boats, Ser Mandon Moore, a hand, a sword coming at his face. If I had not pulled back, that cut would have taken off the top of my head. Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard, because his dead empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions. I should never have trusted any of them. He\u2019d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister\u2019s, and Ser Osmund later, but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor. Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle. Why else? I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of. Tyrion touched his face, plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers. Another gift from my sweet sister.\nThe maester stood beside the bed like a goose about to take flight. \u201cMy lord, there, there will most like be a scar\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMost like?\u201d His snort of laughter turned into a wince of pain. There would be a scar, to be sure. Nor was it likely that his nose would be growing back anytime soon. It was not as if his face had ever been fit to look at. \u201cTeach me, not to, play with, axes.\u201d His grin felt tight. \u201cWhere, are we? What, what place?\u201d It hurt to talk, but Tyrion had been too long in silence.\n\u201cAh, you are in Maegor\u2019s Holdfast, my lord. A chamber over the Queen\u2019s Ballroom. Her Grace wanted you kept close, so she might watch over you herself.\u201d\nI\u2019ll wager she did. \u201cReturn me,\u201d Tyrion commanded. \u201cOwn bed. Own chambers.\u201d Where I will have my own men about me, and my own maester too, if I find one I can trust.\n\u201cYour own\u2026 my lord, that would not be possible. The King\u2019s Hand has taken up residence in your former chambers.\u201d\n\u201cI. Am. King\u2019s Hand.\u201d He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking, and confused by what he was hearing.\nMaester Ballabar looked distressed. \u201cNo, my lord, I\u2026 you were wounded, near death. Your lord father has taken up those duties now. Lord Tywin, he\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHere?\u201d\n\u201cSince the night of the battle. Lord Tywin saved us all. The smallfolk say it was King Renly\u2019s ghost, but wiser men know better. It was your father and Lord Tyrell, with the Knight of Flowers and Lord Littlefinger. They rode through the ashes and took the usurper Stannis in the rear. It was a great victory, and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help His Grace set the realm to rights, gods be praised.\u201d\n\u201cGods be praised,\u201d Tyrion repeated hollowly. His bloody father and bloody Littlefinger and Renly\u2019s ghost? \u201cI want\u2026\u201d Who do I want? He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch him Shae. Who could he send for, who could he trust? Varys? Bronn? Ser Jacelyn? \u201c\u2026my squire,\u201d he finished. \u201cPod. Payne.\u201d It was Pod on the bridge of boats, the lad saved my life.\n\u201cThe boy? The odd boy?\u201d\n\u201cOdd boy. Podrick. Payne. You go. Send him.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will, my lord.\u201d Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out. Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited. He wondered how long he had been here, asleep. Cersei would have me sleep forever, but I won\u2019t be so obliging.\nPodrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse. \u201cMy lord?\u201d He crept close to the bed. How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom? Tyrion wondered. \u201cI meant to stay by you, but the maester sent me away.\u201d\n\u201cSend him away. Hear me. Talk\u2019s hard. Need dreamwine. Dreamwine, not milk of the poppy. Go to Frenken. Frenken, not Ballabar. Watch him make it. Bring it here.\u201d Pod stole a glance at Tyrion\u2019s face, and just as quickly averted his eyes. Well, I cannot blame him for that. \u201cI want,\u201d Tyrion went on, \u201cmine own. Guard. Bronn. Where\u2019s Bronn?\u201d\n\u201cThey made him a knight.\u201d\nEven frowning hurt. \u201cFind him. Bring him.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say. My lord. Bronn.\u201d\nTyrion seized the lad\u2019s wrist. \u201cSer Mandon?\u201d\nThe boy flinched. \u201cI n-never meant to k-k-k-k\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDead? You\u2019re, certain? Dead?\u201d\nHe shuffled his feet, sheepish. \u201cDrowned.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Say nothing. Of him. Of me. Any of it. Nothing.\u201d\nBy the time his squire left, the last of Tyrion\u2019s strength was gone as well. He lay back and closed his eyes. Perhaps he would dream of Tysha again. I wonder how she\u2019d like my face now, he thought bitterly.",

      "content": "Jon\nWhen Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.\nIt will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree. Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever. Will he howl for me when I\u2019m dead, as Bran\u2019s wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered. Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be?\nThe moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared. Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles. \u201cAs shy as a maid on her wedding night,\u201d the big ranger said in a soft voice, \u201cand near as fair. Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.\u201d\nHe was not a man you\u2019d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights. So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch. Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask. Instead he fanned the fire. When the blaze was all acrackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good. The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.\nThe Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face. Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.\nAt first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass. But when they\u2019d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen. Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it. Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.\nThey glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains. Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer. When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire\u2019s garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come. The rest of them would draw off the pursuit. \u201cSend Jon,\u201d Ebben had urged. \u201cHe can ride as fast as me.\u201d\n\u201cJon has a different part to play.\u201d\n\u201cHe is half a boy still.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Qhorin, \u201che is a man of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d\nWhen the moon rose, Ebben parted from them. Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.\nAfter that the days and nights blurred one into the other. They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again. Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names. Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture. They were watched. At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.\nThey were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away. The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake\u2019s mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.\nGhost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron\u2019s blood with their oats, to give them strength. The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down. They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.\nThere was no question of riding double. Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came. Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell. Qhorin refused. \u201cIf any man in the Night\u2019s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother. You can go over mountains that a horse must go around. Make for the Fist. Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how. Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse. Tell him that the trees have eyes again.\u201d\nHe has no chance, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.\nAfter that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely. Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either. Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness. He was glad for that. The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men. Qhorin\u2019s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse. Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights. When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything. Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.\n\u201cIs your sword sharp, Jon Snow?\u201d asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.\n\u201cMy sword is Valyrian steel. The Old Bear gave it to me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember the words of your vow?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d They were not words a man was like to forget. Once said, they could never be unsaid. They changed your life forever.\n\u201cSay them again with me, Jon Snow.\u201d\n\u201cIf you like.\u201d Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness. \u201cNight gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night\u2019s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.\u201d\nWhen they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind. Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father\u2019s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came. It would not be long now. The garrons were near the end of their strength. Qhorin\u2019s mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.\nThe flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading. \u201cThe fire will soon go out,\u201d Qhorin said, \u201cbut if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.\u201d\nThere was nothing Jon could say to that. He nodded.\n\u201cWe may escape them yet,\u201d the ranger said. \u201cOr not.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to die.\u201d It was only half a lie.\n\u201cIt may not be so easy as that, Jon.\u201d\nHe did not understand. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cIf we are taken, you must yield.\u201d\n\u201cYield?\u201d He blinked in disbelief. The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows. They killed them, except for\u2026\u201cThey only spare oathbreakers. Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou will. I command it of you.\u201d\n\u201cCommand it? But\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOur honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe. Are you a man of the Night\u2019s Watch?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere is no but, Jon Snow. You are, or you are not.\u201d\nJon sat up straight. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cThen hear me. If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you. They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father\u2019s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander. You must not balk, whatever is asked of you. Do as they bid you\u2026 but in your heart, remember who and what you are. Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes. And watch.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Jon asked.\n\u201cWould that I knew,\u201d said Qhorin. \u201cYour wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater. What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers. That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do as you say,\u201d Jon said reluctantly, \u201cbut\u2026 you will tell them, won\u2019t you? The Old Bear, at least? You\u2019ll tell him that I never broke my oath.\u201d\nQhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow. \u201cWhen I see him next. I swear it.\u201d He gestured at the fire. \u201cMore wood. I want it bright and hot.\u201d\nJon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames. The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Qhorin said abruptly. \u201cNow we ride.\u201d\n\u201cRide?\u201d It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold. \u201cRide where?\u201d\n\u201cBack.\u201d Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time. \u201cThe fire will draw them past, I hope. Come, brother.\u201d\nJon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood. Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire. The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them. He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance. He hoped so. I do not want to play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.\nThey went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains. Jon remembered the place. They had watered the horses here before the sun went down.\n\u201cThe water\u2019s icing up,\u201d Qhorin observed as he turned aside, \u201celse we\u2019d ride in the streambed. But if we break the ice, they are like to see. Keep close to the cliffs. There\u2019s a crook a half mile on that will hide us.\u201d He rode into the defile. Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire, and followed.\nThe farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side. They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source. Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust.\nA great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through. Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall. The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast. The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight. Jon looked about in dismay. There is no way out. He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses. He did not think they would last long afoot.\n\u201cQuickly now,\u201d the Halfhand commanded. The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished. When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after. His garron did his best to shy away. The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon\u2019s breath.\nThen he was through; drenched and shivering, but through.\nThe cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand. Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard. Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall. Qhorin had already dismounted. Jon did the same. \u201cYou knew this place was here.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls.\u201d He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane. \u201cThere is a way through the heart of the mountain. Come dawn, if they have not found us, we will press on. The first watch is mine, brother.\u201d Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave. Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword.\nHe took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further. Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep. Jon was grateful for his warmth. He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now. If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out. The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.\nSleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves. It was still dark when Qhorin woke him. While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn.\nAt break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders. During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag. He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him. Jon followed with the horses. The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply. In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through. By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went. Not even an eagle can see through solid stone. We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.\nBut when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope. Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.\nQhorin\u2019s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes.\n\u201cHere is as good a place as any to make a stand,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain. Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll feed the horses. They\u2019ve served us bravely, poor beasts.\u201d\nJon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks. He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.\nA hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds. \u201cThey will be with us soon,\u201d announced Qhorin. \u201cKeep your wolf in hand.\u201d\n\u201cGhost, to me,\u201d Jon called. The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him.\nThe wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away. Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood. Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling. \u201cEasy,\u201d Jon murmured. \u201cStay.\u201d Overhead he heard a rustle of wings. The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph.\nThe hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows. Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs. Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls. About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather. On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose. The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls. One had a chipped stone axe. They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids. Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.\nQhorin drew his longsword. The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before. Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath. Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes.\nTen yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted. Their leader came on alone, riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope. As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering; both were armored in bones. Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy mammoths\u2026 and human bones as well.\n\u201cRattleshirt,\u201d Qhorin called down, icy-polite.\n\u201cTo crows I be the Lord o\u2019 Bones.\u201d The rider\u2019s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.\nQhorin snorted. \u201cI see no lord. Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he rides.\u201d\nThe wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared. He did rattle, Jon could hear it; the bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved. \u201cIt\u2019s your bones I\u2019ll be rattling soon, Halfhand. I\u2019ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs. I\u2019ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want my bones, come get them.\u201d\nThat, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do. His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time. But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives. \u201cWe are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf,\u201d she called. \u201cFight or run, you are ours.\u201d\n\u201cShow them,\u201d commanded Rattleshirt.\nThe woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy. Ebben had been bald as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear. \u201cHe died brave,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut he died,\u201d said Rattleshirt, \u201csame like you.\u201d He freed his battleaxe, brandishing it above his head. Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons. The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts. A few chose Jon for their mockery. \u201cIs that your wolf, boy?\u201d a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail. \u201cHe\u2019ll be my cloak before the sun is down.\u201d On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast. \u201cDoes the baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o\u2019 this, boy.\u201d The dogs were barking too.\n\u201cThey would shame us into folly.\u201d Qhorin gave Jon a long look. \u201cRemember your orders.\u201d\n\u201cBelike we need to flush the crows,\u201d Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor. \u201cFeather them!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d The word burst from Jon\u2019s lips before the bowmen could loose. He took two quick steps forward. \u201cWe yield!\u201d\n\u201cThey warned me bastard blood was craven,\u201d he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him. \u201cI see it is so. Run to your new masters, coward.\u201d\nFace reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse. The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said, \u201cThe free folk have no need of cravens.\u201d\n\u201cHe is no craven.\u201d One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair. \u201cThis is the Bastard o\u2019 Winterfell, who spared me. Let him live.\u201d\nJon met Ygritte\u2019s eyes, and had no words.\n\u201cLet him die,\u201d insisted the Lord of Bones. \u201cThe black crow is a tricksy bird. I trust him not.\u201d\nOn a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury.\n\u201cThe bird hates you, Jon Snow,\u201d said Ygritte. \u201cAnd well he might. He was a man, before you killed him.\u201d\n\u201cI did not know,\u201d said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass. \u201cYou told me Mance would take me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he will,\u201d Ygritte said.\n\u201cMance is not here,\u201d said Rattleshirt. \u201cRagwyle, gut him.\u201d\nThe big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, \u201cIf the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you ask.\u201d The words came hard, but Jon said them.\nRattleshirt\u2019s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed. \u201cThen kill the Halfhand, bastard.\u201d\n\u201cAs if he could,\u201d said Qhorin. \u201cTurn, Snow, and die.\u201d\nAnd then Qhorin\u2019s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block. The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon\u2019s hand, and sent him staggering backward. You must not balk, whatever is asked of you. He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease. Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth\u2019s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin\u2019s left-hand cuts. The Halfhand\u2019s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance. Already he could feel his arms growing numb.\nEven when Ghost\u2019s teeth closed savagely around the ranger\u2019s calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet. But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there. Jon planted and pivoted. The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon\u2019s slash had not touched him. Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man\u2019s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.\nGhost\u2019s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch. Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him. The light was already fading in Qhorin\u2019s eyes. \u201c\u2026sharp,\u201d he said, lifting his maimed fingers. Then his hand fell, and he was gone.\nHe knew, he thought numbly. He knew what they would ask of me. He thought of Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black. Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he?\n\u201cGet him up.\u201d Rough hands dragged him to his feet. Jon did not resist. \u201cDo you have a name?\u201d\nYgritte answered for him. \u201cHis name is Jon Snow. He is Eddard Stark\u2019s blood, of Winterfell.\u201d\nRagwyle laughed. \u201cWho would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling\u2019s byblow.\u201d\n\u201cGut him.\u201d That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse. The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm, screeching.\n\u201cHe yielded,\u201d Ygritte reminded them.\n\u201cAye, and slew his brother,\u201d said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm.\nRattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering. \u201cThe wolf did his work for him. It were foully done. The Halfhand\u2019s death was mine.\u201d\n\u201cWe all saw how eager you were to take it,\u201d mocked Ragwyle.\n\u201cHe is a warg,\u201d said the Lord of Bones, \u201cand a crow. I like him not.\u201d\n\u201cA warg he may be,\u201d Ygritte said, \u201cbut that has never frightened us.\u201d Others shouted agreement. Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt\u2019s stare was malignant, but he yielded grudgingly. These are a free folk indeed, thought Jon.\nThey burned Qhorin Halfhand where he\u2019d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches. Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky. Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger\u2019s gear. Ygritte won his cloak.\n\u201cWill we return by the Skirling Pass?\u201d Jon asked her. He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing behind us.\u201d The look she gave him was sad. \u201cBy now Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.\u201d",

      "content": "Bran\nThe ashes fell like a soft grey snow.\nHe padded over dry needles and brown leaves, to the edge of the wood where the pines grew thin. Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames. The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong he began to slaver.\nYet as one smell drew them onward, others warned them back. He sniffed at the drifting smoke. Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.\nAll through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet. Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror. Howls shuddered through the night; the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, laughter and screams. No beast was as noisy as man. He pricked up his ears and listened, and his brother growled at every sound. They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes and embers through the sky. In time the flames began to dwindle, and then they were gone. The sun rose grey and smoky that morning.\nOnly then did he leave the trees, stalking slow across the fields. His brother ran with him, drawn to the smell of blood and death. They padded silent through the dens the men had built of wood and grass and mud. Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed; others stood as they had before. Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man. Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near. The wild dogs slunk away before them.\nBeneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell. His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes. When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg. They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then he fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur.\nThe dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were blind. He could feel its cold fingers on him. The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose. He struggled against the pull. He did not like the darkness. He was wolf. He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky. He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled. I will not go, he cried. I am wolf, I will not go. Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so he could not see or smell or hear or run, and the grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black\u2026\n\u201cBran,\u201d a voice was whispering softly. \u201cBran, come back. Come back now, Bran. Bran\u2026\u201d\nHe closed his third eye and opened the other two, the old two, the blind two. In the dark place all men were blind. But someone was holding him. He could feel arms around him, the warmth of a body snuggled close. He could hear Hodor singing \u201cHodor, hodor, hodor,\u201d quietly to himself.\n\u201cBran?\u201d It was Meera\u2019s voice. \u201cYou were thrashing, making terrible noises. What did you see?\u201d\n\u201cWinterfell.\u201d His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. One day when I come back I won\u2019t know how to talk anymore. \u201cIt was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse smells, and steel, and blood. They killed everyone, Meera.\u201d\nHe felt her hand on his face, stroking back his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re all sweaty,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you need a drink?\u201d\n\u201cA drink,\u201d he agreed. She held a skin to his lips, and Bran swallowed so fast the water ran out of the corner of his mouth. He was always weak and thirsty when he came back. And hungry too. He remembered the dying horse, the taste of blood in his mouth, the smell of burnt flesh in the morning air. \u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cThree days,\u201d said Jojen. The boy had come up softfoot, or perhaps he had been there all along; in this blind black world, Bran could not have said. \u201cWe were afraid for you.\u201d\n\u201cI was with Summer,\u201d Bran said.\n\u201cToo long. You\u2019ll starve yourself. Meera dribbled a little water down your throat, and we smeared honey on your mouth, but it is not enough.\u201d\n\u201cI ate,\u201d said Bran. \u201cWe ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him.\u201d The cat had been tan-and-brown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce. He remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.\n\u201cThe wolf ate,\u201d Jojen said. \u201cNot you. Take care, Bran. Remember who you are.\u201d\nHe remembered who he was all too well; Bran the boy, Bran the broken. Better Bran the beastling. Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams, his wolf dreams? Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened. He could reach Summer whenever he wanted, and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon. Though maybe he had only dreamed that. He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to pull him back now. Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position. \u201cI have to tell Osha what I saw. Is she here? Where did she go?\u201d\nThe wildling woman herself gave answer. \u201cNowhere, m\u2019lord. I\u2019ve had my fill o\u2019 blundering in the black.\u201d He heard the scrape of a heel on stone, turned his head toward the sound, but saw nothing. He thought he could smell her, but he wasn\u2019t sure. All of them stank alike, and he did not have Summer\u2019s nose to tell one from the other. \u201cLast night I pissed on a king\u2019s foot,\u201d Osha went on. \u201cMight be it was morning, who can say? I was sleeping, but now I\u2019m not.\u201d They all slept a lot, not only Bran. There was nothing else to do, Sleep and eat and sleep again, and sometimes talk a little\u2026 but not too much, and only in whispers, just to be safe. Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all, but there was no way to quiet Rickon, or to stop Hodor from muttering, \u201cHodor, hodor, hodor,\u201d endlessly to himself.\n\u201cOsha,\u201d Bran said, \u201cI saw Winterfell burning.\u201d Off to his left, he could hear the soft sound of Rickon\u2019s breathing.\n\u201cA dream,\u201d said Osha.\n\u201cA wolf dream,\u201d said Bran. \u201cI smelled it too. Nothing smells like fire, or blood.\u201d\n\u201cWhose blood?\u201d\n\u201cMen, horses, dogs, everyone. We have to go see.\u201d\n\u201cThis scrawny skin of mine\u2019s the only one I got,\u201d said Osha. \u201cThat squid prince catches hold o\u2019 me, they\u2019ll strip it off my back with a whip.\u201d\nMeera\u2019s hand found Bran\u2019s in the darkness and gave his fingers a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll go if you\u2019re afraid.\u201d\nBran heard fingers fumbling at leather, followed by the sound of steel on flint. Then again. A spark flew, caught. Osha blew softly. A long pale flame awoke, stretching upward like a girl on her toes. Osha\u2019s face floated above it. She touched the flame with the head of a torch. Bran had to squint as the pitch began to burn, filling the world with orange glare. The light woke Rickon, who sat up yawning.\nWhen the shadows moved, it looked for an instant as if the dead were rising as well. Lyanna and Brandon, Lord Rickard Stark their father, Lord Edwyle his father, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donnor and Lord Beron and Lord Rodwell, one-eyed Lord Jonnel, Lord Barth and Lord Brandon and Lord Cregan who had fought the Dragonknight. On their stone chairs they sat with stone wolves at their feet. This was where they came when the warmth had seeped out of their bodies; this was the dark hall of the dead, where the living feared to tread.\nAnd in the mouth of the empty tomb that waited for Lord Eddard Stark, beneath his stately granite likeness, the six fugitives huddled round their little cache of bread and water and dried meat. \u201cLittle enough left,\u201d Osha muttered as she blinked down on their stores. \u201cI\u2019d need to go up soon to steal food in any case, or we\u2019d be down to eating Hodor.\u201d\n\u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor said, grinning at her.\n\u201cIs it day or night up there?\u201d Osha wondered. \u201cI\u2019ve lost all count o\u2019 such.\u201d\n\u201cDay,\u201d Bran told her, \u201cbut it\u2019s dark from all the smoke.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019lord is certain?\u201d\nNever moving his broken body, he reached out all the same, and for an instant he was seeing double. There stood Osha holding the torch, and Meera and Jojen and Hodor, and the double row of tall granite pillars and long dead lords behind them stretching away into darkness\u2026 but there was Winterfell as well, grey with drifting smoke, the massive oak-and-iron gates charred and askew, the drawbridge down in a tangle of broken chains and missing planks. Bodies floated in the moat, islands for the crows.\n\u201cCertain,\u201d he declared.\nOsha chewed on that a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll risk a look then. I want the lot o\u2019 you close behind. Meera, get Bran\u2019s basket.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going home?\u201d Rickon asked excitedly. \u201cI want my horse. And I want applecakes and butter and honey, and Shaggy. Are we going where Shaggydog is?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bran promised, \u201cbut you have to be quiet.\u201d\nMeera strapped the wicker basket to Hodor\u2019s back and helped lift Bran into it, easing his useless legs through the holes. He had a queer flutter in his belly. He knew what awaited them above, but that did not make it any less fearful. As they set off, he turned to give his father one last look, and it seemed to Bran that there was a sadness in Lord Eddard\u2019s eyes, as if he did not want them to go. We have to, he thought. It\u2019s time.\nOsha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. A naked sword hung down her back, one of the last to bear Mikken\u2019s mark. He had forged it for Lord Eddard\u2019s tomb, to keep his ghost at rest. But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing. Meera had claimed Lord Rickard\u2019s blade, though she complained that it was too heavy. Brandon took his namesake\u2019s, the sword made for the uncle he had never known. He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in his hand.\nBut it was only a game, and Bran knew it.\nTheir footsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them swallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no mere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore stone crowns. Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. Edwyn the Spring King. Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf. Brandon the Burner and Brandon the Shipwright. Jorah and Jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton the Moon King, Edderion the Bridegroom, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet and Benjen the Bitter, King Edrick Snowbeard. Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done terrible things, but they were Starks every one, and Bran knew all their tales. He had never feared the crypts; they were part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he would lie here too.\nBut now he was not so certain. If I go up, will I ever come back down? Where will I go when I die?\n\u201cWait,\u201d Osha said when they reached the twisting stone stairs that led up to the surface, and down to the deeper levels where kings more ancient still sat their dark thrones. She handed Meera the torch. \u201cI\u2019ll grope my way up.\u201d For a time they could hear the sound of her footfalls, but they grew softer and softer until they faded away entirely. \u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor nervously.\nBran had told himself a hundred times how much he hated hiding down here in the dark, how much he wanted to see the sun again, to ride his horse through wind and rain. But now that the moment was upon him, he was afraid. He\u2019d felt safe in the darkness; when you could not even find your own hand in front of your face, it was easy to believe that no enemies could ever find you either. And the stone lords had given him courage. Even when he could not see them, he had known they were there.\nIt seemed a long while before they heard anything again. Bran had begun to fear that something had happened to Osha. His brother was squirming restlessly. \u201cI want to go home!\u201d he said loudly. Hodor bobbed his head and said, \u201cHodor.\u201d Then they heard the footsteps again, growing louder, and after a few minutes Osha emerged into the light, looking grim. \u201cSomething is blocking the door. I can\u2019t move it.\u201d\n\u201cHodor can move anything,\u201d said Bran.\nOsha gave the huge stableboy an appraising look. \u201cMight be he can. Come on, then.\u201d\nThe steps were narrow, so they had to climb in single file. Osha led. Behind came Hodor, with Bran crouched low on his back so his head wouldn\u2019t hit the ceiling. Meera followed with the torch, and Jojen brought up the rear, leading Rickon by the hand. Around and around they went, and up and up. Bran thought he could smell smoke now, but perhaps that was only the torch.\nThe door to the crypts was made of ironwood. It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to the ground. Only one person could approach it at a time. Osha tried once more when she reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging. \u201cLet Hodor try.\u201d\nThey had to pull Bran from his basket first, so he would not get squished. Meera squatted beside him on the steps, one arm thrown protectively across his shoulders, as Osha and Hodor traded places. \u201cOpen the door, Hodor,\u201d Bran said.\nThe huge stableboy put both hands flat on the door, pushed, and grunted. \u201cHodor?\u201d He slammed a fist against the wood, and it did not so much as jump. \u201cHodor.\u201d\n\u201cUse your back,\u201d urged Bran. \u201cAnd your legs.\u201d\nTurning, Hodor put his back to the wood and shoved. Again. Again. \u201cHodor!\u201d He put one foot on a higher step so he was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise. This time the wood groaned and creaked. \u201cHodor!\u201d The other foot came up a step, and Hodor spread his legs apart, braced, and straightened. His face turned red, and Bran could see cords in his neck bulging as he strained against the weight above him. \u201cHodor hodor hodor hodor hodor HODOR!\u201d From above came a dull rumble. Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran\u2019s face, blinding him for a moment. Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was open. Osha poked her spear through and slid out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera\u2019s legs to follow. Hodor shoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface. The Reeds had to carry Bran up the last few steps.\nThe sky was a pale grey, and smoke eddied all around them. They stood in the shadow of the First Keep, or what remained of it. One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away. Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn across the yard. They fell just where I did, Bran thought when he saw them. Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he was alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the tumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was.\nThe First Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now it was more of a shell than ever. The floors had burned inside it, and all the beams. Where the wall had fallen away, they could see right into the rooms, even into the privy. Yet behind, the broken tower still stood, no more burned than before. Jojen Reed was coughing from the smoke. \u201cTake me home!\u201d Rickon demanded. \u201cI want to be home!\u201d Hodor stomped in a circle. \u201cHodor,\u201d he whimpered in a small voice. They stood huddled together with ruin and death all around them.\n\u201cWe made noise enough to wake a dragon,\u201d Osha said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no one come. The castle\u2019s dead and burned, just as Bran dreamed, but we had best\u2014\u201d She broke off suddenly at a noise behind them, and whirled with her spear at the ready.\nTwo lean dark shapes emerged from behind the broken tower, padding slowly through the rubble. Rickon gave a happy shout of \u201cShaggy!\u201d and the black direwolf came bounding toward him. Summer advanced more slowly, rubbed his head up against Bran\u2019s arm, and licked his face.\n\u201cWe should go,\u201d said Jojen. \u201cSo much death will bring other wolves besides Summer and Shaggydog, and not all on four feet.\u201d\n\u201cAye, soon enough,\u201d Osha agreed, \u201cbut we need food, and there may be some survived this, Stay together. Meera, keep your shield up and guard our backs.\u201d\nIt took the rest of the morning to make a slow circuit of the castle. The great granite walls remained, blackened here and there by fire but otherwise untouched. But within, all was death and destruction. The doors of the Great Hall were charred and smoldering, and inside the rafters had given way and the whole roof had crashed down onto the floor. The green and yellow panes of the glass gardens were all in shards, the trees and fruits and flowers torn up or left exposed to die. Of the stables, made of wood and thatch, nothing remained but ashes, embers, and dead horses. Bran thought of his Dancer, and wanted to weep. There was a shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower, and hot water gushing from a crack in its side. The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery had collapsed into the yard below, and Maester Luwin\u2019s turret was gone. They saw a dull red glow shining up through the narrow cellar windows beneath the Great Keep, and a second fire still burning in one of the storehouses.\nOsha called softly through the blowing smoke as they went, but no one answered. They saw one dog worrying at a corpse, but he ran when he caught the scents of the direwolves; the rest had been slain in the kennels. The maester\u2019s ravens were paying court to some of the corpses, while the crows from the broken tower attended others. Bran recognized Poxy Tym, even though someone had taken an axe to his face. One charred corpse, outside the ashen shell of Mother\u2019s sept, sat with his arms drawn up and his hands balled into hard black fists, as if to punch anyone who dared approach him. \u201cIf the gods are good,\u201d Osha said in a low angry voice, \u201cthe Others will take them that did this work.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Theon,\u201d Bran said blackly.\n\u201cNo. Look.\u201d She pointed across the yard with her spear. \u201cThat\u2019s one of his ironmen. And there. And that\u2019s Greyjoy\u2019s warhorse, see? The black one with the arrows in him.\u201d She moved among the dead, frowning. \u201cAnd here\u2019s Black Lorren.\u201d He had been hacked and cut so badly that his beard looked a reddish-brown now. \u201cTook a few with him, he did.\u201d Osha turned over one of the other corpses with her foot. \u201cThere\u2019s a badge. A little man, all red.\u201d\n\u201cThe flayed man of the Dreadfort,\u201d said Bran.\nSummer howled, and darted away.\n\u201cThe godswood.\u201d Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. \u201cThere is a power in living wood,\u201d said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking, \u201ca power strong as fire.\u201d\nOn the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, Maester Luwin lay on his belly in the dirt. A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where he had crawled. Summer stood over him, and Bran thought he was dead at first, but when Meera touched his throat, the maester moaned. \u201cHodor?\u201d Hodor said mournfully. \u201cHodor?\u201d\nGently, they eased Luwin onto his back. He had grey eyes and grey hair, and once his robes had been grey as well, but they were darker now where the blood had soaked through. \u201cBran,\u201d he said softly when he saw him sitting tall on Hodor\u2019s back. \u201cAnd Rickon too.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThe gods are good. I knew\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKnew?\u201d said Bran uncertainly.\n\u201cThe legs, I could tell\u2026 the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs\u2026 poor lad\u2026\u201d He coughed, and blood came up from inside him. \u201cYou vanished\u2026 in the woods\u2026 how, though?\u201d\n\u201cWe never went,\u201d said Bran. \u201cWell, only to the edge, and then doubled back. I sent the wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father\u2019s tomb.\u201d\n\u201cThe crypts.\u201d Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips. When the maester tried to move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain.\nTears filled Bran\u2019s eyes. When a man was hurt you took him to the maester, but what could you do when your maester was hurt?\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to make a litter to carry him,\u201d said Osha.\n\u201cNo use,\u201d said Luwin. \u201cI\u2019m dying, woman.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d said Rickon angrily. \u201cNo you can\u2019t.\u201d Beside him, Shaggydog bared his teeth and growled.\nThe maester smiled. \u201cHush now, child, I\u2019m much older than you. I can\u2026 die as I please.\u201d\n\u201cHodor, down,\u201d said Bran. Hodor went to his knees beside the maester.\n\u201cListen,\u201d Luwin said to Osha, \u201cthe princes\u2026 Robb\u2019s heirs. Not\u2026 not together\u2026 do you hear?\u201d\nThe wildling woman leaned on her spear. \u201cAye. Safer apart. But where to take them? I\u2019d thought, might be these Cerwyns\u2026\u201d\nMaester Luwin shook his head, though it was plain to see what the effort cost him. \u201cCerwyn boy\u2019s dead. Ser Rodrik, Leobald Tallhart, Lady Hornwood\u2026 all slain. Deepwood fallen, Moat Cailin, soon Torrhen\u2019s Square. Ironmen on the Stony Shore. And east, the Bastard of Bolton.\u201d\n\u201cThen where?\u201d asked Osha.\n\u201cWhite Harbor\u2026 the Umbers\u2026 I do not know\u2026 war everywhere\u2026 each man against his neighbor, and winter coming\u2026 such folly, such black mad folly\u2026\u201d Maester Luwin reached up and grasped Bran\u2019s forearm, his fingers closing with a desperate strength. \u201cYou must be strong now. Strong.\u201d\n\u201cI will be,\u201d Bran said, though it was hard. Ser Rodrik killed and Maester Luwin, everyone, everyone\u2026\n\u201cGood,\u201d the maester said. \u201cA good boy. Your\u2026 your father\u2019s son, Bran. Now go.\u201d\nOsha gazed up at the weirwood, at the red face carved in the pale trunk. \u201cAnd leave you for the gods?\u201d\n\u201cI beg\u2026\u201d The maester swallowed. \u201cA\u2026 a drink of water, and\u2026 another boon. If you would\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAye.\u201d She turned to Meera. \u201cTake the boys.\u201d\nJojen and Meera led Rickon out between them. Hodor followed. Low branches whipped at Bran\u2019s face as they pushed between the trees, and the leaves brushed away his tears. Osha joined them in the yard a few moments later. She said no word of Maester Luwin. \u201cHodor must stay with Bran, to be his legs,\u201d the wildling woman said briskly. \u201cI will take Rickon with me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go with Bran,\u201d said Jojen Reed.\n\u201cAye, I thought you might,\u201d said Osha. \u201cBelieve I\u2019ll try the East Gate, and follow the kingsroad a ways.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the Hunter\u2019s Gate,\u201d said Meera.\n\u201cHodor,\u201d said Hodor.\nThey stopped at the kitchens first. Osha found some loaves of burned bread that were still edible, and even a cold roast fowl that she ripped in half. Meera unearthed a crock of honey and a big sack of apples. Outside, they made their farewells. Rickon sobbed and clung to Hodor\u2019s leg until Osha gave him a smack with the butt end of her spear. Then he followed her quick enough. Shaggydog stalked after them. The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf\u2019s tail as it vanished behind the broken tower.\nThe iron portcullis that closed the Hunter\u2019s Gate had been warped so badly by heat it could not be raised more than a foot. They had to squeeze beneath its spikes, one by one.\n\u201cWill we go to your lord father?\u201d Bran asked as they crossed the drawbridge between the walls. \u201cTo Greywater Watch?\u201d\nMeera looked to her brother for the answer. \u201cOur road is north,\u201d Jojen announced.\nAt the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in his basket for one last glimpse of the castle that had been his life. Wisps of smoke still rose into the grey sky, but no more than might have risen from Winterfell\u2019s chimneys on a cold autumn afternoon. Soot stains marked some of the arrow loops, and here and there a crack or a missing merlon could be seen in the curtain wall, but it seemed little enough from this distance. Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I\u2019m not dead either.",
